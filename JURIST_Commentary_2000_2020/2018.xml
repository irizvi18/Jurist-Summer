		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Iryna Chelyshava of Vlasova Mikhel & Partners, a Belarusian law firm, discusses a recent decree by the Belarusian government drastically expanding the use of cryptocurrency...</p>

                <p>On December 21, 2017, <a href="http://president.gov.by/en/">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, the President of the Republic of Belarus <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belarus-cryptocurrency/belarus-adopts-crypto-currency-law-to-woo-foreign-investors-idUSKBN1EG0XO">signed</a> Decree No. 8, "On the Development of the Digital Economy" ("the Decree"), aimed at the development of the digital economy in the Republic of Belarus by regulating blockchain, <a href="https://learn.stashinvest.com/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-explainer">cryptocurrencies</a>, tokens, mining, smart contracts, and defining the legal status of such new subjects as crypto-platform operators and cryptocurrency exchange operators. The rules of the Decree are unique, and is in some ways more advanced than even the most highly developed jurisdictions.</p>

                <p>The Decree entitles legal entities and individual entrepreneurs who are residents of the High Technology Park (the HTP) to perform operations with tokens (including cryptocurrency). Others can use tokens in the territory of Belarus through residents of the HTP.</p>

                <p>From a legal point of view, the most interesting aspect of the Decree is the regulation of newly introduced technological instruments such as blockchain, tocken, and smart contracts.</p>

                <p>The Decree defines the <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/23/blockchain-definition/">blockchain</a> as a sequence of blocks built on the basis of given algorithms in a distributed decentralized information system using cryptographic methods of information protection, that contains information about operations performed in such a system. Despite the fact that the definition does not cover any legal aspects of blockchain use, the advantage of the definition is that it is very broad and can cover many possible implementations of the blockchain. The definition covers other distributed information systems in which centralization elements can be present, no matter on which platform they are implemented, in addition to the "classic" blockchain. This gives elements of technological neutrality to the appropriate regulation.</p>

                <p>The digital sign (token) is defined as a record in the transaction block registry (blockchain), another distributed information system that certifies the rights of the owner of the digital sign (token) to civil the objects of civil rights and (or) is a crypto currency. While cryptocurrency is defined as a bitcoin, another digital sign (token) used in international turnover as a universal means of exchange. We can conclude from these definitions that the token is chosen as a general concept, which covers both traditional cryptocurrencies and tokens produced during the ICO. Basically, the token is defined as digital representation of a certain civil right, implemented on the basis of blockchain technology (other distributed information system). </p>

                <p>The Decree does not specify the nature of the certain civil right, and therefore the concept of "token" is provided with a high degree of flexibility taking it beyond the narrowest understanding of this phenomenon as the result of ICO. The requirement of the existence of a token in distributed information system is provided, in our opinion, in order to distinguish token form security. However it does not resolve the possible conflicts of the legal regime applicable to the law underlying the token and the legal regime of the token itself that could arise. These issues cannot be modeled or anticipated now, so the answers will have to be found already in the practice.</p>

                <p>The definition given in the Decree for cryptocurrency lists it as a version of the token; that is, a record in the blockchain, which is used internationally as a universal means of exchange. Therefore, the definition recognizes an objective fact, which the European Central Bank has already pointed out: that the cryptocurrency performs at least some functions of money. However, the recognition of the cryptocurrency as a universal means of exchange does not mean that the Decree allowed its free use in the territory of Belarus as it is only possible to exchange cryptocurrency for another currency, electronic money, tokens. The characteristic of international use is similar to one used in Japan and means that for recognition of a token to be a cryptocurrency it is necessary to recognize it as such not only in the territory of the Republic of Belarus, but also in other countries. </p>

                <p>In general, the definition of cryptrocurrency given in the Decree is very progressive. However, for now the Decree does not provide the criteria of cryptocurrency that would distinguish it from tokens. Also the approach to define cryptocurrency as variety of token is interesting; however it is not possible now to predict if it will be successful. </p>

                <p>The Decree contains the definition of smart-contract, which is the first definition of the smart contract in the world fixed at the legislative level. A smart contract is defined as a program code intended for functioning in the transaction block registry (a blockchain), another distributed information system for the purpose of automated execution and (or) execution of transactions or the performance of other legally significant actions". </p>

                <p>The definition of the Smart Contract proposed in the Decree seems to be very successful. It is not confined solely to the technical understanding of this phenomenon and is broad enough to encompass various approaches to understanding of smart contract that exist now: as a way to automate the implementation of the "traditional" civil law contract and as a self-sufficient contract, the terms of which are set out in the form of program code and which can be concluded and performed without the participation of a person. In case of distribution of smart contracts in the foreseeable future any special adaptation of the concept of the smart contract to this form of contracting will not be required, however it does not exclude the need to develop special legal norms regulating the distribution of risks of technical errors and illegal influences from outside to its operation.</p>

                <p>Many provisions of the Decree regulating transactions with tokens (cryptocurrencies), are very progressive, particularly provisions for smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, regulation of ICO procedures and others. However, more concrete understandings of these provisions created in the Republic of Belarus will appear only after acceptance of all necessary accompanying legal acts. At the same time, their practice and their application will play a key role in assessing the attractiveness of this jurisdiction for potential investors and participants of the HTP.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Chris Jones-Pauly discusses the misunderstandings regarding the indigenous laws of South Sudan in the context of transitional justice.</p>

<p>In December 2013 South Sudan exploded into civil war, three years after the South's secession. The initial protagonists are <a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2016/five-years-since-south-sudan/index.html">Kiir</a>, a Warrap Dinka, and <a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2016/five-years-since-south-sudan/index.html">Machar</a>, a Nuer of Unity state. They signed the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (<a href="https://unmiss.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/final_proposed_compromise_agreement_for_south_sudan_conflict.pdf">ARCISS 2015</a>) [PDF]. Part V prescribes transitional justice structures to hold all sides accountable for atrocities. Additionally traditional authorities are to identify meritorious claims for reparations.</p>

<p>Traditional leaders are 'customary' Kings (Shiluk, Azande), rain queens and kings (Lotuko), law chiefs, prophets (Nuer), drum masters (Murle), cattle camp chiefs, storytellers (re-phrasers). For centuries they have been responsible for governance of the more than 64 to 72 ethnic peoples in South Sudan. The <a href="http://southsudanhumanitarianproject.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/formidable/The-Local-Government-Act-2009.pdf">Local Government Act 2009</a> [PDF] recognizes their autonomy to enact their own legislation. The Act never having been enforced, the struggle between autonomy and centralized political control rages on. The ruling liberation party and military, SPLM/A (Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army), praise the traditionalists for mobilizing during 50 years of fighting popular support. Yet traditional leaders recall hard time when they protested the SPLM/A confiscations of land, cattle and forced recruits. Chiefs continue today to constrain all armed groups whether SPLM/A or otherwise. One chief drew the line: for survival they could eat pigs but not cattle.</p>

<p>The 2015 ARCSS has not been enforced. More armed groups have emerged, splintering opposition to Juba. Some manifest territorial and ethnic affiliations, e.g. the seasoned General Cirillo Swaka, a Bari, of the Equatorias, though appealing to al the country. Combat has disrupted farming, causing famine. The stream of refugees will empty the country by more than half. Western donors seek desperately a solution.</p>

<p>In 2016 the NY Times and in the Financial Times featured op eds about transitional justice and traditional African justice. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/opinion/south-sudan-needs-truth-not-trials.html">One</a>, written in the name of Machar and Kiir, advocated reconciliation over trials in the planned Hybrid Court. The second op ed by a western diplomat recommended an UN/AU 'trusteeship' and involving 'tribal constituencies', i.e. traditional authorities. A third op ed by a western lawyer favored the traditional system to achieve peace, described as 'restorative and reconciliatory'.</p>

<p>The point of this article is to argue that pitting traditional justice against justice in a Hybrid Court is inaccurate. It erodes principles of accountability that characterize traditional justice systems.</p>

<p>I prefer to call traditional law indigenous laws, or the peoples' laws. I challenge the perspective that the South Sudanese peoples have no law rather 'customs' that are restorative and harmonizing. Already in the 1920s anthropologist Malinowski argued that westerners suffered from preconceived notions of 'primitive' or 'savage' society. It has no law only custom. He countered-argued: the 'primitive' has law and order distinct from morals and manners. Law he defined as a person has obligations (duty holder) and another person has rightful claims (rights). These obligations and claims are enforced by someone without personal ties to either party.</p>

<p>Half a century later British law professor Allot reaffirmed the argument that what is called customary is law. Even though it is not written down or legislated in the Austinian tradition, African indigenous law is law, people's law, 'legislated' by the people, grown out of conscious choice and behavior within their environment. The 'happy' legislator in the positivist tradition is puzzled by the resistance of the people. 'The legislator imposes and the people dispose.' It is wise to pay attention to this resistance. Otherwise one runs the risk of failed legal reform and failed unity because the people's law has been resisted. Prestigious western universities teach Islamic penal laws but not  African people's laws.</p>

<p>Many researchers coined the term restorative justice for indigenous traditional laws, restoring social harmony without being judgmental. The term is not South Sudanese, rather American. It brings victim and offender together to restore relationships.</p>

<p>Western tort law aims to restore the wronged person to as much wholeness as possible, e.g. bodily injury receives compensation for costs, or a negligent wrong invokes punitive damages. In criminal cases, like trafficking, victims may sue for damages in tandem with the state prosecutor. Nonetheless the tort or damages law is not labelled restorative. It is law, imposing liability for breaching an obligation. The term 'restorative' for African indigenous law implies that it is inferior to western laws.</p>

<p>The South Sudanese African indigenous laws require compensation/damages to right wrongs as well. The laws punish killings, rape, kidnapping, environmental damage with punitive damages depending on the circumstances. The peoples' laws are judgmental.</p>

<p>Confusing western lawyers are feuds occurring after a trial in traditional court and damages paid. Contrary to western supposition, feuds constitute an offence, punishable with punitive damages.</p>

<p>Confusing too is a ritual pursuant to judgment and sentencing. A bull is slaughtered and the parties eat together regardless of who won or lost. It aims to alleviate lingering bitter feelings. Western law lacking such a concept does not understand it well. It is interpreted as reconciliatory or restorative. Translating concepts from one legal system into another is not an uncommon problem. For example, English trust law is not well understood in German courts.</p>

<p>In another ritual, depending on the offence, a goat is slaughtered, not to reconcile rather to cleanse perpetrator and victim. An offence poisons the society, just as murder in a western community sets people on edge. Cleansing rituals are too mystical for the western law.</p>

<p>Rituals are mistaken as the essence of the indigenous laws. The 1999 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/sudan1103/13.htm">Wunlit peace agreement</a> between Nuer and Dinka specified the offences committed and the legal punishment due. Bulls were slaughtered. The agreement failed ultimately because the ritual took place prior to the enforcement of the sentences.</p>

<p>Rejection of 'customary' laws stems from the belief that gender inequality forms the core of the entire indigenous system. Gender, racist and religious discrimination are perpetuated by western courts, but the west has faith its legal system will correct itself as litigants bring judicial challenges. The west has no faith in the indigenous 'primitive' society to use its legal principles to overcome discrimination in challenging cases. This attitude mirrors the preconception that African 'customary' law is restorative and reconciliatory, not law. By misconstruing the system westerners violate their own principles of comparing legal systems as equals.</p>

<p>If the traditional indigenous law is not taken seriously, it is vulnerable to politicization that favors a kind of 'pre-trial' acquittal without even naming the offenses. It perverts amnesty so leaders can escape accountability.</p>

<p>Accountability is known in the indigenous laws of South Sudan. It constitutes either a Grundnorm or a specific offense. When a chief acts against community interests, he is warned and his defense heard but if he continues, he is deposed. Even if a king does not resist detrimental government actions, even the king is to be deposed. The laws of deposing in some communities, like laws of impeachment, are well articulated while in some less precise. A British administrator (Driberg) confessed observing more democracy at the grassroots than had been pre-conceived (echoes of Malinowski). A chief is also punishable for defrauding the community, e.g. when mismanaging contributions of food in case of emergencies.</p>

<p>What role can traditional authorities play in the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum for peace and transitional justice? Invited to sit at the table are the armed opposition and government military or militias. They are not categorized as members of their own ethnicities whose laws they have violated. Representatives of the peoples' indigenous laws are not invited, reflecting the preconception that 'simple' traditionalists need no chance to articulate how their laws of accountability would apply. The presumption is that their 'primitive' tribal identity and their disrespect for females renders them unfit to judge with objectivity. Some westerners allege there is a danger of romanticizing traditional law. My response is that state law has been too long romanticized. To recall Allott, the peace-makers will impose and the people will dispose. Those who do not wish to face a Hybrid Court will hide behind misconstruing traditional justice as reconciliatory without imposing liability or accountability.</p>

<p>The political and aspiring rulers of the South Sudan state had an opportunity to prove their ability to rule but have failed, disrespecting not only the international norms of decency but the laws of their communities.</p>

<p>Transitional justice is no stranger to traditional chiefs. During the civil war with Khartoum chiefs heard cases brought against SPLM/A commanders, who were punished for wrong doings according to the traditional laws. After the ARCSS 2015 a group of chiefs formed in W. Equatoria an NGO to discuss transitional justice. The Dinka Bor chiefs assembled in 2016 to present a written version of their laws with the purpose of defying interference from the state magistrates. Ignoring rules of appeals, the magistrates arbitrarily removed cases from chiefs' courts. Recently the Nuer Koma people forced the Juba-imposed governor to delay forming his administration until he agreed to be held accountable for providing public services. In Bahr al Ghazal food aid donors conceded that their rules of distribution caused conflict because they violated the peoples' laws of social welfare. If the chiefs were involved the people could hold them accountable for maldistribution, otherwise the community has no similar power over the civilian distributors.</p>

<p>Hybrid Court is also no stranger to the chiefs. In a judicial innovation during the CPA (<a href="https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/sites/default/files/accords/SudanCPA.pdf">Comprehensive Peace Agreement 2005-2011</a>) [PDF] era, cattle raiding cases in the Lakes region were assigned to a mixed court of chiefs and a state magistrate. It heard a backlog of unsettled cases that provoked feuding. The experiment expired after two years for lack of funds. The idea stemmed from the Tanzanian experience of courts presided over by three traditional authorities and one magistrate, who can be outvoted.</p>

<p>The traditional leaders need a chance to articulate in unambiguous terms their laws that punish leaders who breach the traditional laws of accountability. Their communities need the chance to authenticate their chiefs - some have been selected according to their indigenous laws while some are appointed by the SPLM/A, and are regarded as 'forced' chiefs such as among the Twic Dinka Ayual in 2012. Inter-communal courts have been formed at the initiative of chiefs so as to achieve more objectivity. Westerners ought to disavow themselves of the preconception that this is not a 'tribal' conflict. Each cultural group, no matter how small, sees itself and its culture as equal to any other and so power is to be equally distributed among the cultural groups. Dominance is not only political. It is economic as well. Once the oil fields are under the control of one group, this will be regarded as economic dominance. Again some westerners would interpret resistance to dominance as a power play, that is, traditional leaders who hold power do not wish to lose their power over their communities. For a westerner would disbelieve the traditional law of accountability because it does not fit into the portrayal of the indigenous as restoring harmony, and above all is mere customary.  This view blinds westerners to the need to take seriously the history of what dominance means in South Sudan. Traditionally there can be no dominance among the South Sudanese. European ethnographers alike were stunned by the extraordinary self-consciousness and independence of the peoples they encountered, having preconceived the 'primitive' as obedient and easy to cower. Anthropologist/Administrator Driberg warned in 1927 chiefs are no subordinate government servants rather leaders of their people. The Azande kingship is shared among clans. My own experience confirmed the chiefs' fearlessness, rebuking In public local and UN officials for taking the people for gullible fools. This is already a warning sign of the fear of dominance by any one tribe or clan. Proportional representation leading to over representation of any one cultural group has been feared as far back as the '70s. </p>

<p>Inviting traditional chiefs and recognizing the merits of the peoples' laws is novel for the western-minded. All other peace efforts have failed. It is time to try another approach and call on those strengths of traditional laws that would serve transitional justice and strengthen their long held but suppressed rules of accountability.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/facultymember/biography?id=bill.araiza">William D. Araiza</a> of the <a href="https://www.brooklaw.edu">Brooklyn Law School</a> discusses the lawsuit filed by Paul Manafort against Robert Mueller and the Department of Justice... </p><strong>P</strong>aul Manafort's <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2018/01/manafort-sues-justice-department-mueller.php">recent lawsuit</a> challenging the legality of his indictment by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller raises a set of intriguing questions--not least about his attorney's litigation choices. The lawsuit is likely to take its place as one of the stranger, if perhaps more obscure, episodes in the already-bizarre saga of candidate and then President Trump's relationship with Russia and the investigation that seeks to uncover the facts about that relationship.</p>

<p>Recall the story up to now: In late October, a federal grand jury convened by Special Prosecutor Mueller indicted Manafort, the foreign-government lobbyist who served for a time as then-candidate Donald Trump's campaign manager. The indictment alleged a variety of violations of financial disclosure and foreign agent registration laws related to Manafort's work for Ukrainian politicians. Because of Manafort's prominence in the Trump campaign and his close ties to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine, his indictment immediately triggered speculation that Mueller was seeking to use Manafort to obtain information about the activities of other Russia-related conduct by high-ranking persons in Trumpworld.</p>

<p>On January 3, Manafort filed the lawsuit challenging his indictment. The legal grounds for that challenge are interesting enough (as explained later), but the first head-scratcher is a preliminary one: why file this lawsuit at all?  The normal course, and certainly the more direct one, would have been to move to quash the indictment. Indeed, as Steve Vladeck has <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/50433/fatal-flaw-manafort-suit/">argued</a>, the traditional rule against equitable civil relief when a criminal defendant can obtain an adequate remedy in the criminal proceeding suggests the legal error, and not just the tactical strangeness, of Manafort's suit.</p>

<p>But perhaps there's something underlying the suit beyond its technical legal claims. Perhaps the lawsuit aspires to a broader, more far-reaching result than the simple quashing of his indictment. Indeed, some of his requests for relief, for example, for "an order . . . setting aside" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's charge to Mueller setting forth the scope of Mueller's investigative jurisdiction, do seem, at least formally, to go beyond the kind of relief that could be sought in a simple motion to quash his indictment. But presumably a favorable ruling in such a motion would rest on reasoning that would apply more generally, so it's not clear what the actual difference would be, unless Manafort simply wants to make a broader statement about the investigation.</p>

<p>Yet that speculation is called into question by the legal arguments the lawsuit actually makes. The second of the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4343227/1-3-18-Manafort-v-DOJ-Complaint.pdf">complaint's </a>two counts alleges that Mueller's indictment of Manafort exceeded the authority Rosenstein gave to Mueller. Specifically, it alleges that Manafort's dealings with Ukraine were well-known to the FBI a decade before Mueller began his investigation. Thus, according to the lawsuit, those dealings could not be understood as "matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation" into links between Russia and the Trump campaign--one of the heads of jurisdiction Rosenstein granted Mueller. But it's hard to see why that is. Just because Manafort's Ukraine-related activities occurred well before the Trump campaign was a gleam in anyone's eye, and just because the FBI knew about them long ago, doesn't mean that they did not "arise directly from" the Trump-Russia investigation. Indeed, common sense would suggest that Manafort's previous connections with Russia-affiliated entities would in fact be quite relevant to any connections that eventually developed between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016.</p>

<p>But that second count is small-bore. More noteworthy from a public law perspective is the argument in Count One. In Count One Manafort alleges that Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein himself violated the DOJ's Special Prosecutor regulations when he charged Mueller with investigating " any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation" into links between Russia and the Trump campaign. According to the complaint, that charge violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.4">regulations' provision</a> that "The Special Counsel will be provided with a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated."  According to Manafort, the "any matters" jurisdiction Rosenstein gave Mueller violates that provision. According to the complaint, that jurisdictional grant "purports to grant Mr. Mueller <em>carte blanche</em> to investigate and pursue criminal charges with <em><strong>anything</strong></em> he stumbles across while investigating, no matter how remote from the specific matter identified as the subject of" Rosenstein's order appointing Mueller. (emphasis in original).</p>

<p>This argument is couched in terms of Rosenstein's alleged non-compliance with DOJ's special prosecutor regulations, which Manafort's complaint concedes are "carefully crafted" and "carefully circumscribe[d]." Leave aside the fact that the regulations <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/600.10">expressly state</a> that they create no enforceable rights--an inconvenient fact the complaint acknowledges but then bizarrely dismisses as irrelevant. Also leave aside the fact that <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download">Rosenstein's appointment</a> of Mueller was not actually based on those regulations, even though the appointment order does make those regulations applicable. The larger import of this claim is that his description of the regulations hints at the problem of carelessly crafted and uncircumscribed prosecutorial authority--characteristics that, at a constitutional level, were alleged in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/case.html">Morrison v. Olson</a> to render the Watergate-era special prosecutor law unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>But one searches the complaint in vain for a broad claim that Rosenstein's grant of authority to Mueller is unconstitutional. Aside from a passing reference to Justice Scalia's dissent in Morrison, the complaint does not claim that a special prosecutor--indeed, one who, like both Mueller and the special prosecutor in Morrison, enjoys "good cause" removal protection--is unconstitutional, either facially or as applied to this allegedly overbroad charge. A few scholars have made such arguments, a fact Manafort's lawyer presumably knew. And while the district court judge might not have accepted such an argument, an aggressive appeals panel might have been willing either to accept it or at least tee the question up for the Supreme Court. Perhaps more importantly, a constitutional argument would have made the legal splash that Manafort was possibly thinking about making in light of his curious initial decision not to simply seek the quashing of his own indictment.</p>

<p>What gives? One might just dismiss the complaint as an effort doomed from the start, as scholars have done <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/50433/fatal-flaw-manafort-suit/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/50434/flaws-manaforts-suit-including-fundamental-mistaken-assumption-rosenstein-appointed-muller-pursuant-doj-regulations/">here</a>. Perhaps so. But perhaps Manafort's real hope is to persuade Rosenstein to avoid litigation over the issue by issuing an amended, and more limited, charge to Mueller that would exclude the conduct for which Manafort has been indicted--or maybe to hope for a new, non-recused, Attorney General who would take that step.</p>

<p>Thus, what we might have here is a middle path: a lawsuit that seeks to do more than simply quash Manafort's own indictment, and does so by way of a seemingly-technical argument about the government's compliance with its own regulations, but one that nevertheless hints at broader constitutional issues that advocates of a unitary executive theory of the Constitution (including perhaps a new Attorney General) might find attractive. The proper analogy for this lawsuit is thus neither the blunderbuss, all-guns-blazing attack nor the surgical strike. Instead, to mix metaphors, it's a low-probability bank shot in billiards. It's unlikely to succeed. But who knows? It worked for Paul Manafort's erstwhile boss.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, <a href="https://www.committeeforjustice.org/curt-levey">Curt Levey</a>, of the Committee for Justice, discusses the implications of Kim Dotcom's fight to avoid extradition from New Zealand to the US...</p><strong>N</strong>otorious Internet pirate Kim Dotcom suffered another legal setback last month in his fight to avoid extradition from New Zealand to the United States and hang on to his treasure borne of massive copyright infringement when the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/kim-dotcoms-extradition-battle-suffers-high-court-setback-171215/">High Court of New Zealand rejected</a> all of Dotcom's contested arguments against extradition.</p>

                <p>The treasure was generated by Megaupload, Dotcom's brainchild and one of the world's biggest Internet sites when it was shut down by the Justice Department in 2012. Ostensibly a cloud-based storage system for large files, the site produced <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/justice-department-charges-leaders-of-megaupload-with-widespread-online-copyright-infringement">more than $175 million per year</a> in revenue generated by its premium subscribers and third-party advertising attracted by the site's 50 million daily visitors.  </p>

                <p>However, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/megaupload_indictment.pdf">2012 federal indictment of Megaupload</a> [PDF], Dotcom, and his co-conspirators for running an international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive copyright infringement, money laundering, and racketeering confirms that the legitimate storage aspect of the business was only a front. What really drew visitors to the site was the ability to download pirated movies, songs, software, video games, books, and the like. Megaupload made its fortune by actively encouraging monumental amounts of copyright infringement, rewarding its millions of users for uploading this pirated material. Legitimate usage of the site was not similarly rewarded.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/04pdf/04-480.pdf">U.S. Supreme Court has held</a> [PDF] that websites like Megaupload, which actively encourage copyright infringement through file sharing, can be held liable (see MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd). Law-abiding websites and Internet service providers, on the other hand, are protected by the safe harbor provision in the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act </a> [PDF] (DMCA) , which was signed into law in 1998, so long as they "expeditiously" remove infringing material upon notice.</p>

                <p>Because Dotcom was clearly on the wrong side of the law, his Megaupload profits and many of the expensive toys he bought with them were seized in a raid on his $24 million estate in New Zealand. He spent a month in a New Zealand jail then three months under house arrest.</p>

                <p>The conspirators' criminal conduct cost the motion picture, television, and music industries <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/pressrel/press-releases/justice-department-charges-leaders-of-megaupload-with-widespread-online-copyright-infringement">more than half a billion dollars</a>, money that comes out of the pockets of average citizens such as set designers, sound engineers, theater employees, struggling actors, and support staff more so than those of stars and moguls. Dotcom&#8217;s toys &#8212; yachts, fancy custom cars, and a personal helicopter to name just a few &#8212; were purchased at the expense of the millions of Americans whose livelihoods, health benefits, and retirement plans depend on these industries.</p>

                <p>Nonetheless, Dotcom has wrapped himself in the banners of Internet freedom and consumer choice and would have us believe that he is the victim. But the First Amendment and other guarantees of Internet freedom no more protect the massive theft of online intellectual property than they do robbing a record store or committing online credit card fraud.</p>

                <p>Nor does consumer choice depend on such piracy. As former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/mpaa-donuts-team-takedown-best-practice/153668">pointed out</a>, "Filmmakers and distributors are already using the Internet to offer more options than ever before for accessing online legal content, including over 115 such sites in the U.S. alone."</p>

                <p>Dotcom is no freedom fighter, consumer champion, or innovative entrepreneur. What he actually is is a career criminal. His lengthy rap sheet includes prison sentences for embezzlement, fraud, insider trading, and data espionage - including hacking Pentagon computers - among other crimes.</p>

                <p>The entertainment industry's anti-piracy efforts have focused on voluntary initiatives, including <a href="https://www.tagtoday.net/hubfs/Measuring%20digital%20advertising%20revenue%20to%20infringing%20sites.pdf?t=1514989754621">asking companies not to advertise</a> [PDF] on pirate websites. Even civil litigation is generally reserved for the worst offenders, rather than the occasional downloader.</p>

                <p>As the 191-page <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-edva/legacy/2013/12/20/Mega%20Evidence.pdf">summary of evidence</a>  [PDF] makes clear, Megaupload and Dotcom had to work hard to join the tiny group of infringers charged criminally. Dotcom now faces years or even decades in an American prison.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Justice Department attorneys are <a href="https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/vaed/307658/">pursuing a parallel civil action</a> for asset forfeiture against Dotcom and his colleagues. They are going after tens of millions of dollars of proceeds from Dotcom's crimes, much of which came from stealing the intellectual property of American artists and companies.</p>

                <p>Dotcom argues that the United States does not have jurisdiction over his assets located in New Zealand and Hong Kong. However, <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/151360.P.pdf">American courts have rejected</a> [PDF] his challenge. Because <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13852335071344862690&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Dotcom is resisting extradition</a>, he has been declared a fugitive and, as a U.S Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruling made clear, a federal statute disentitles fugitives from contesting government forfeiture actions.</p>

                <p>Dotcom's argument that the statute violates his constitutional rights came to a dead end when the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100217zor_o7jp.pdf">U.S. Supreme Court rejected</a> [PDF] the petition for review this fall. American justice is finally catching up with Dotcom, who is learning that large-scale, intentional online piracy will not be taken lightly.<br />
                    If you are a teenager illegally downloading a movie or a website operator making a good faith but imperfect effort to remove infringing content, you don't have to worry about American law enforcement coming after you.</p>

                <p>But for those who conspire to steals millions of dollars through massive worldwide copyright infringement, even holing up halfway around the world in New Zealand will not serve as protection from the law.</p>

		<title>The Story of ICTY:  Legal Success Emerging from Tragedy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Mohit Gupta of <a href="http://www.sau.int">South Asian University </a> discusses the legacy of the ICTY...</j:header><br />
<strong>I</strong>nternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), an ad hoc international criminal tribunal established by mandate from United Nations Security Council officially came to its end on December 21, 2017. The tribunal was created in response to atrocities committed in former Yugoslavia. Few would have imagined at that time that the perpetrators of the atrocities would be brought to justice, and the culture of impunity surrounding the most gruesome crimes would finally come to an end.   </p>

<p>The tribunal operated for 10,800 days, examined more than 4,000 witnesses and convicted 90 individuals. <a href="http://www.icty.org/en/content/infographic-icty-facts-figures">These figures show overall outcome of the proceedings in ICTY.</a><br />
 <br />
ICTY strengthened the concept of the rule of law by ushering in a new era in international criminal justice where accountability for atrocities has become the universal value. ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/en/about/tribunal/achievements">inspired the creation</a> of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court. There has also <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.co.in/&httpsredir=1&article=2489&context=jil">been a demand</a> to have  similar international crimes tribunals for Sri Lanka and <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/demand-an-immediate-international-criminal-tribunal-for-israel-to-stop-global-war/2925">Israel</a>. The ICTY has set a benchmark for future prosecutions in other deadly conflicts. </p>

<p>The success story of the tribunal begins from <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/acdec/en/51002.htm">its very first case</a> where it was asserted that the Security Council had no authority to set up tribunals like ICTY. The ICTY was faced with the question of whether it has the power to pass a ruling on the legality of its own creation by the Security Council. The appeals chamber progressively dealt with the question and accepted that there could be limited judicial review of the Security Council resolution which created it, as that was the required for determining whether ICTY had primary jurisdiction over crime enumerated under its statute. This was a landmark ruling because it was the first time it was asserted that a Security Council resolution was subject to some judicial review, albeit in a limited capacity.        </p>

<p>Although the tribunal held that the Security Council's invocation of Chapter VII, which allowed for the creation of the tribunal, was justified, the amenability of the Security Council resolution to limited judicial review had a long-lasting impact on the authority of Security Council, which had been seen as a world legislature with no checks and balance on its power. Thus ICTY not only shaped the jurisprudence of international criminal law, it brought new dimensions to public international law. </p>

<p>ICTY has been a pioneer in creating the contemporary architecture of criminal justice. It has distilled and evolved some of the key concepts of criminal jurisprudence. Establishment of the concept of "joint criminal responsibility" at an international level comes from the ICTY.  The appeals chamber ruled in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/acjug/en/tad-aj990715e.pdf">Tadic case</a> of 1999 that the commission of one of the crimes mentioned under its statute may also occur through participation in the realization of a common design or purpose. Although this concept of joint criminal responsibility was firmly established in the domestic criminal law of countries, it did not previously exist in international criminal law until the ICTY's invocation. By incorporating this concept in international criminal jurisprudence, the tribunal aided in healing the woes of thousands of victims of atrocities of international crimes.   </p>

<p>The ICTY has also taken groundbreaking steps in <a href="http://www.icty.org/?q=en/features/crimes-sexual-violence">paving the way for effective prosecution of wartime sexual violence</a>. It was the first international criminal tribunal to classify rape as a form of torture and sexual enslavement as a crime against humanity. </p>

<p>Establishment of ICTY was a bold experiment in international justice. Some <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/tributes-to-justice-done-as-yugoslav-war-crimes-court-closes/article/510600">high profile perpetrators</a> like Zdravko Tolimir, Radovan Karadzic, and Ratko Mladic, also dubbed the "Butcher of Bosnia," have been tried by the tribunal. The Yugoslav Tribunal was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-warcrimes-mladic-tribunal-legacy/clamor-for-justice-yugoslav-court-leaves-global-legacy-idUSKBN1DK132">first to indict a sitting head of state</a> in Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic. The tribunal contributed in breaking the culture of impunity and helping to ensure that no one goes unpunished for the perpetration of gravest crimes, regardless of political status. <br />
  <br />
The ICTY, being first international war crimes tribunal established after Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals, has lived up to the expectations and hopes of the international community. It has successfully discharged its function by strengthening criminal jurisprudence, which will be inherited and taken forward by International Criminal Court. In the <a href="http://www.icty.org/en/press/president-agius-addresses-united-nations-general-assembly">words of President Agius</a>, the ICTY "will continue to serve as a reminder of what is possible in the fight against impunity".    </p>

<p><strong>S</strong>exual abuse of young athletes has been a persistent problem in Olympic and amateur sports. Most recently, hundreds of <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2018/1/19/16900674/larry-nassar-abuse-timeline-usa-gymnastics-michigan-state">allegations surfaced</a> against Dr. Larry Nassar, a team physician for Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics, the national governing body (NGB) for the sport. Victims <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/us/larry-nassar-investigation-fallout-march/index.html">claim</a> that USA Gymnastics and Michigan State did not do enough to address numerous reports that Nassar's purported medical treatment was in fact sexual assault. Nassar was <a href="/forum/NassarSentence.pdf">sentenced</a> to sixty years in prison on federal charges, and up to 175 years after accepting a plea deal for the state charges. He also faces <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/20/mckayla-maroney-alleges-in-civil-suit-that-nassar-took-pornographic-photos-of-her/">civil claims</a> brought by some of his victims, including former Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney. Maroney's suit asserts claims against Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and USA Gymnastics, and include allegations of negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, failure to warn, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>

<p>The ultimate resolution of Maroney's suit is unclear (though it is likely that at least some of the defendants will settle). However, the larger effects of Nassar's abuse will be felt across Olympic and amateur sports. To begin, Congress is soon expected to enact the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1973">Protecting Young Victims Act</a>). The Act would require, among other things, that sport NGBs report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to law enforcement and the newly established United States Center for SafeSport. The Center for SafeSport will have jurisdiction over all allegations of abuse--including sexual, physical, and emotional--concerning US Olympic Movement sports. SafeSport is charged with developing policies to prevent and respond to allegations of abuse. SafeSport opened its headquarters in Colorado and promulgated the <a href="https://77media.blob.core.windows.net/uscss/1488581091937.2017-03-03---safesport-code---final.pdf">SafeSport Code</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>While the SafeSport initiative is an important step to remedy a long-standing problem in Olympic Movement sports, its impact across youth sports may be limited. This is illustrated by the fact that Nassar was aided in his ability to conceal the full impact of his crimes because he committed them across sports contexts. The US takes a unique approach to regulating youth and amateur sports.  We are one of the few countries in the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/the-ioc/leading-the-olympic-movement">Olympic Movement</a> that does not have a "sports ministry" or similar government entity responsible for centralized regulation and coordination of Olympic and amateur sport. Instead, sport in the US is regulated by level, setting up a patchwork of policies and norms tailored to the particular sports setting. Thus,  interscholastic sports are regulated at the state level, intercollegiate sports are regulated by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Olympic sports are regulated by the USOC and applicable NGBs (such as USA Gymnastics or USA Swimming) and professional sports are regulated by their respective leagues. Sports regulation also primarily occurs through private sector entities, and not a government agency. With the exception of some high school athletic associations, which are affiliated with the state, the USOC and NCAA are private, and not state actors.<br />
 <br />
An advantage of this type of regulation is that rules and procedures are tailored for the needs of the specific context. Education-based sports programs (a uniquely American phenomenon) operate differently from Olympic Movement sport, which ultimately answers to the International Olympic Committee and International Federations for sport. Athletes may move freely between these different settings (so that, for instance, an NCAA swimmer or track and field athlete may also compete for Team USA in the Olympics). However, the patchwork approach to regulation undoubtedly contributed to the lack of timely and effective information sharing about Dr. Nassar between Michigan State and USA Gymnastics. Without a centralized, coordinating body for all amateur sport in the United States, it is easier for acts such as those perpetrated by Dr. Nassar to continue.</p>

<p>The absence of any centralized coordinating body for amateur sports also means that amending the Protecting Young Victims Act will not fully address the problem. The statute is aimed at protecting minors and those who train and compete in settings over which the USOC and NGBs have jurisdiction--which does not include intercollegiate sports. While USA Gymnastics has been the focus of the media attention around Dr. Nassar's crimes, Michigan State's role has thus far been less examined (though the NCAA has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/sports/michigan-state-ncaa-investigation.html">opened an investigation</a>). NCAA regulations generally focus on sports-related rules to preserve its conception of "amateurism" and competitive balance. Moreover, institutions, not athletes, are members of the NCAA. Michigan State gymnasts abused by Dr. Nassar therefore would not have a remedy through the NCAA. The NCAA's only potential response, as it did with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/sports/ncaafootball/penn-state-penalties-include-60-million-fine-and-bowl-ban.html">Penn State</a> in response to Jerry Sandusky's sex crimes, is to sanction the institution. Since the NCAA and its member institutions are not covered by legislation aimed at the US Olympic Movement, the promise of SafeSport may not fully benefit intercollegiate athletes. </p>

<p>Yet beyond the technical legal questions over what sports entities have jurisdiction to take action--and what action can be taken--in the wake of Nassar's crimes, a critical issue raised by Nassar's abuse that has been largely ignored is the question of what, exactly, is "sports medicine," who are appropriate "team physicians," and what steps Congress and/or sports regulators should take to protect athletes. </p>

<p>A key theme in the narratives around Nassar's abuse was that he was a respected team physician who claimed to be providing legitimate medical care. His accusers were discounted, or in many cases did not fully comprehend the nature of the abuse, because he claimed his actions were medical treatment. In addition, a significant part of the Nassar story was the fact that coaches and administrators were quite happy and impressed by him, readily requiring athletes to use Nassar's services as a condition of being a member of the team. All of this despite the fact that many of the athletes have said that Nassar's "treatments" did not work. <br />
 <br />
"Sports medicine" has been an increasingly important part of sports, but it occurs largely in the shadows. The term itself has no specific legal significance. A variety of health care professionals claim to practice in this area--from chiropractors, physical therapists, and osteopathic physicians (like Dr. Nassar) to primary care physicians and orthopedic surgeons. Often, "sports medicine" practice is performed by one who takes the role of a team physician, providing medical care to athletes who train and perform for a particular team. Some medical specialties have fellowship training and additional qualifications that may be earned to reflect specialization in this area. Various medical groups have articulated best practices and made efforts to publish research and advance "sports medicine" as a discipline. However, there has been little effort by sports regulators such as the USOC or NCAA to clearly define what types of sports medicine providers may affiliate with athletes under their jurisdiction, and what the expectations for "sports medicine" care in these contexts would be.  </p>

<p>The troubling issues raised by "sports medicine" and team physicians have been discussed in the context of professional sports. Specifically, athletes and commentators have expressed concerns over team physicians' potentially conflicting loyalties. Thus, a team physician serving at the pleasure of the team may have an incentive to "clear" even injured athletes to play. Keeping coaches and owners happy would help guarantee a team physician's continued affiliation with the program and its personal and professional rewards. In short, at the professional level, the concern has been that team physicians' potentially conflicting loyalties could work to the detriment of athletes.  </p>

<p>The concern is even greater in the case of youth and amateur sports. Notably, Dr. Nassar has been referred to as a "volunteer" physician for USA Gymnastics. In fact, many Olympic and intercollegiate team physicians are volunteers, as are other "sports medicine" providers. By volunteering to cover games and treat athletes, these providers can greatly contribute to athletes' health and wellbeing. At its worst, however, these individuals can easily affiliate themselves with young athletes who have little choice or knowledge of what to expect from the "sports medicine" experience. By keeping coaches and team administrators happy (by clearing athletes to participate, for example), the divided loyalty problem can be even more problematic. Without the rights and resources of professional athletes, Olympic and amateur athletes can be particularly at risk.</p>

<p>It is in this way that the Protecting Young Victims Act and the SafeSport initiative fall short. The original Amateur Sports Act which established the modern US Olympic Movement envisioned the USOC as being a pioneer in sports medicine research and care. Decades later, the Larry Nassar case illustrates that serious, urgent questions remain about how the USOC selects and monitors those who claim to provide care to athletes, many of whom are children. Similarly, the NCAA has had little to say about how its member institutions provide sports medicine care to their athletes. Without standards or meaningful supervision, it is far too easy for providers to gain access to athletes and engage in treatments that are tainted by conflicting loyalties, are potentially ineffective, and at worst, are criminal assault.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Isaac Smith of the University of Cincinnati School of Law discusses the First Amendment implications of actions taken by Ohio University administrators...</j:header></p>

<p>In 2017, violent student protests made headlines nationwide. The often minimal discipline meted out afterwards inspired legislative efforts in several states to impose mandatory punishments upon students who disrupt campus events. Against this backdrop, Ohio University's actions last February stand out. Approximately seventy people <a href="http://thenewpolitical.com/2017/02/01/baker-sit-make-history-70-arrested/">were arrested</a> for peacefully protesting inside the fourth-floor lobby of Baker Center, the student center on campus. </p>

<p>The mass arrest was controversial: The building was open, and protests have taken place in Athens for decades, including in that very lobby. But the Ohio University police chief nonetheless ordered the arrest of all seventy students, alumni, and community members who sat huddled together in the middle of the lobby.<br />
 <br />
One student was taken to trial first as a test case. An Athens County judge found that the fourth-floor lobby of Baker Center was a designated public forum, that the university's actions in arresting the defendant were not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, and that ample alternative channels of communication were unavailable. So the test case defendant was acquitted at a bench trial in late March, and the charges against all the other defendants who had pleaded not guilty<a href="https://www.athensnews.com/news/campus/trespassing-charges-dismissed-against-remaining-baker-protesters/article_35050df2-12fc-11e7-8192-2f3fb852c3d1.html"> were dropped</a> shortly thereafter.<br />
 <br />
OU responded to the judge's ruling <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/policy/24-014.html">by issuing</a> an interim policy banning all demonstrations inside all university buildings. The interim policy is currently under review by an advisory board, and the university may make significant changes in implementing a final, permanent version. Community members have voiced strong opposition to the demonstration ban, and the policy change has received <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/13/ohio-universitys-new-free-expression-policy-bars-indoor-protests">national coverage</a>. The ACLU of Ohio <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/archives/press-releases/ohio-universitys-proposed-free-speech-policies-are-unconstitutional-says-aclu">expressed</a> the opinion that the "Freedom of Expression" policy is facially unconstitutional. Effectively, OU took an area that a judge declared to be a designated public forum, and closed it.<br />
 <br />
But can OU do that?</p>

<p>Courts have not given a clear answer. Responses to the question within law reviews have also been few: there are only <a href="https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&context=flr">three</a> <a href="http://www.arizonalawreview.org/pdf/54-2/54arizlrev496.pdf">student-written</a> <a href="http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=mjlr">notes</a> on the subject.<br />
 <br />
In explaining the different types of public fora, the Supreme Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12768748082551342004"><u>Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association</u></a> noted that in the case of a limited or designated public forum, "a state is not required to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility." Fair enough. </p>

<p>But following that short sentence in Perry, there hasn't been much guidance from the high court about when and how a limited or designated public forum can be closed. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9510136217607691229"><u>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette</u></a>, the Supreme Court suggested that a forum could be permissively closed in its entirety to avoid discriminating on the basis of viewpoint. <br />
 <br />
The Fourth Circuit embraced <u>Pinette's</u> broad standard in 2013. The Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) sought to display flags on Lexington, Virginia's utility poles, which the court held were a designated public forum. Following the Supreme Court's suggestion in Pinette, Lexington stopped the SCV from hanging flags by simply banning all flag displays. SCV sued, arguing that the motivation of the government was important in determining the permissibility of the closure of a designated public forum.<br />
 <br />
But the Fourth Circuit wasn't persuaded, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15498298802615924628">stating flatly</a> that "[a] government is entitled to close a designated public forum to all speech." The court continued, noting that the "clean hands" requirement suggested by the SCV would produce an "absurd result," requiring the city to allow speakers with which it disagreed to use its utility poles. </p>

<p>But this "absurd result" is just viewpoint neutrality by another name. To allow the city to close the forum is to allow a convenient end-run around the First Amendment.<br />
 <br />
Not all courts have embraced such a permissive approach. In response to the closure of a limited public forum in an open attempt to stop a demonstration, the Middle District of Pennsylvania in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17037738717699677203"><u>ACT-UP v. Walp</u></a> noted that the closure was "the spitting image of an improper prior restraint--an attempt to suppress speech prior to publication or dissemination." This result seems truer to the spirit of the First Amendment. Two other district courts have followed this logic.<br />
 <br />
The District of Connecticut in 2017 recognized the plain disagreement between <u>SCV</u> and <u>ACT-UP</u>, and attempted to reconcile the two holdings by reading the closure in <u>ACT-UP</u> as temporary, compared to the permanent closure in <u>SCV</u>. The court reasoned that a temporary closure is more akin to prior restraint than a permanent one. <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/connecticut/ctdce/3:2015cv00681/108212/61/"><u>Fair v. Esserman</u></a>. But the district court in ACT-UP did not see the forum closure at issue there as temporary. In fact, in discussing whether there was injury sufficient to warrant an injunction, the court noted that there was no indication that the forum would ever be opened again.<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately for OU students keen on protesting inside Baker Center again, and <u>ACT-UP</u> and its brethren are the exception, not the rule. While OU's decision to close the forum is a heavy-handed move--akin to what the court in <u>ACT-UP</u> noted was "not the narrowest means possible," saying the government "used a club instead of a scalpel," --such heavy-handedness is endorsed by the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14423580194988440348">Third</a>, <a href="httphttps://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15498298802615924628">Fourth</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=86289797017635806">Seventh</a>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1267345.html">Eighth</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15738873524766508167">Ninth</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10576957179297162727">Eleventh</a> Circuits.<br />
 <br />
The Sixth has yet to weigh in. But following the lead of other circuits, the Sixth could choose to read Perry broadly and give the government unchecked forum closure power. That would permit Ohio University to do exactly what it has done, and ban all demonstrations in a designated public forum, directly in response to a thwarted attempt to punish peaceful protesters.<br />
 <br />
If OU exploits the ambiguity of the law and closes the forum entirely, it may win in court, but the First Amendment will certainly lose.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border"> JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.case.edu/Our-School/Faculty-Staff/Meet-Our-Faculty/Faculty-Detail/id/998">Ruqaiijah Yearby</a> of <a href="http://law.case.edu">Case Western Reserve University School of Law</a> discusses the legality of a work requirement for Medicaid eligibility and the impact this will have on poverty . . . </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n November 15, 2017, the Institute for Policy Studies <a href="https://www.ips-dc.org/jeff-bezos-bill-gates-warren-buffett-wealthier-bottom-half-country-combined/">issued</a> a report noting that the three richest people in the United States (Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffet, and Bill Gates) were wealthier than the 160 million people in the bottom half of the country combined. Two months later, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a guidance in <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd18002.pdf">support </a>of mandatory work requirements for some of the 160 million individuals to obtain access to health care.  </p>

<p>Specifically, the guidance said that based on its authority under Medicaid, CMS would allow states to require that non-elderly, non-pregnant adults (able-bodied adults) work as a condition to their eligibility for Medicaid. CMS asserted that the work requirement would further Medicaid's objectives by promoting better mental, physical, and emotional health and help individuals and families rise out of poverty and attain independence.  Although these are admirable goals, the work requirement arguably violates the objectives of the Medicaid Act and will not promote better health, lift people out of poverty, or help able-bodied adults attain independence. </p>

<p>Medicaid <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1901.htm">requires</a> States with monetary support from the federal government to "furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care[.]"</p>

<p>In its guidance, CMS cites the language of independence as support for the work requirement but some argue that, based on the statutory context, this means <a href="http://familiesusa.org/blog/2018/01/six-reasons-work-requirements-are-bad-idea-medicaid">physical functioning</a>. Even if the language is found to support the need for individual independence, Medicaid requires States to provide services to help families and individuals attain independence.  Yet in the guidance, CMS shifts this responsibility to able-bodied adults.  This is counter to the plain language of Medicaid, which focuses on states' responsibilities, not the responsibility of individuals who qualify for Medicaid. However, in its guidance, CMS prohibits states from using Medicaid dollars to able-bodied adults in meeting the work requirements.</p>

<p>Although, based on the language of Section 1115, CMS can <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title11/1115.htm">waive</a> compliance of the requirements of Medicaid, such as providing services to help families and individuals attain independence, to enable a state to carry out an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project that would promote the Medicaid's objectives, some argue that CMS cannot add requirements to Medicaid, such as working, without Congress providing additional authority. </p>

<p>Under former President Barack Obama, CMS allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to able-bodied adults and implement voluntary work training programs.  As a result of this expansion, a Kaiser Family Foundation literature review<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a-literature-review-september-2017/"> showed </a>that Medicaid's expansion positively affected access to health care, utilization of services, the affordability of care, the financial security among the low-income population, and it led to reductions in the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.  </p>

<p>In the past, courts have <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2671711">invalidated </a>waivers that required work requirements because they did not meet the objectives of the statute. In this case the work requirement does not meet the objective of Medicaid, which is to provide health care for poor people. According to the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/commentary/work-requirements-medicaid-wont-work-heres-serious-alternative">Heritage Foundation </a>and the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-and-work-requirements-new-guidance-state-waiver-details-and-key-issues/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, the Medicaid work requirement will make it harder for able-bodied adults to register for Medicaid, limiting access to health care necessary to keep them well enough to work, and may increase health care costs because these adults will seek care in the emergency room instead of seeking routine care.  </p>

<p>Moreover, there is no evidence that the work requirement will fulfill the objectives CMS lists in the guidance: promote better health, help individuals and families rise out of poverty, or able-bodied adults attain independence. According to the Chetty <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866586/pdf/nihms783419.pdf">study</a> cited in the CMS guidance, higher income was correlated with greater life expectancy throughout the nation, but there was significant state variation. For instance, in the ten states (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas) with the lowest life expectancy for low-income individuals there was a significant association with healthy behaviors, not unemployment rates, i.e. working. This is significant because many of these states are seeking Medicaid waivers to require work requirements based on the theory that working promotes better health. The lack of evidence correlating employment to better health is further illustrated by the fact that the guidance says this hypothesis, i.e. that work requirements will improve the health of able-bodied adults on Medicaid, should be proven by states, who have no expertise in conducting health benefits research, without financial or program development assistance from CMS. <br />
 <br />
Additionally, the work requirement will not lift people out of poverty.  A recent University of Berkeley <a href="http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/pdf/2016/Producing-Poverty.pdf">report</a> found that by 2013, US manufacturing workers made 7.7% below the median wage for all occupations, causing 1 of 3 manufacturing workers to go on welfare and almost 1 million manufacturing workers and their families to enroll in Medicaid/CHIP (equal to 15% of all manufacturing workers).  Thus, obtaining employment does not guarantee that an individual or their families will rise out of poverty. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, CMS notes in the guidance that in the past many states have had successes with voluntary work programs linked to Medicaid.  Yet, CMS does not cite any specific state program that has been successful in lifting people out of poverty or making them independent.  </p>

<p>In fact, states that implemented a work requirement for recipients on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) did not show long-term success in cutting poverty or increasing long-term employment because states did not provide substantial job support such as training, education, and placement.  The result of the TANF work requirement was to remove many recipients from the program, causing them to sink further into severe poverty, after which many states stopped tracking the requirement because they did not have sufficient money in their budgets to fund the tracking.  </p>

<p>The problems with the Medicaid work requirement are further <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/demonstration-and-waiver-list/?entry=39258">illustrated</a> by Kentucky's "Helping to Engage and Achieve Long Term Health (HEALTH)" Medicaid waiver, which was approved on January 12, 2018 and is being <a href="http://www.healthlaw.org/issues/medicaid/waivers/stewart-v-hargan-lawsuit-challenging-kentucky-medicaid-waiver-project#.Wm45nZM-drw">challenged</a> in federal court. First, although the waiver requires able-bodied adults to complete 80 hours of community engagement in a 30-day period or state-approved health literacy or financial literacy course to be eligible for Medicaid, it fails to include any information about the state efforts to support unemployed able-bodied adults in meeting the requirements.  </p>

<p>Second, in the CMS guidance, applications for waivers allowing work requirements were required to include information about how the state would address market forces and structural barriers to work, such as high unemployment.  This information was not included in the approved Kentucky waiver and it is unclear how Kentucky, with the 4th highest percentage of people in poverty out of 50 states, is going to be able to address market forces and structural barriers to work for unemployed able-bodied adults. Hence, arguably CMS violated its own rules by approving a waiver that did not fulfill the requirements of the guidance. </p>

<p>If CMS wants to fulfill Medicaid's objective of lifting people out of poverty and helping able-bodied adults attain independence, then CMS should require states to provide support for Medicaid beneficiaries that would make them independent. Specifically, CMS has the authority and should require states to provide Medicaid beneficiaries with:</p>

<p>1.    Voluntary job training that is show to result in long-term full-time work;<br />
2.    Subsidized work wages until the job provides a living wage;<br />
3.    Subsidized transportation to job training and work; and<br />
4.    Subsidized or free childcare.</p>

<p>Some of these measures are already being discussed by states, such as Montana and Pennsylvania, to support families and able-bodied adults on Medicaid in becoming independent.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/wendy-k-mariner/">Wendy K. Mariner</a> of <a href="http://www.bu.edu/law/">Boston University School of Law</a> discusses the Trump Administration's recent issued guidance that will allow states to include employment as a requirement for Medicaid enrollment... </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n January 11, 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) sparked immediate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/upshot/medicaid-work-requirements-trump.html?_r=0">controversy</a> by announcing new <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/downloads/smd18002.pdf">policy</a> [PDF] for states seeking §1115 Medicaid waivers. For the first time, CMS invited states to impose work or related requirements (job training, job searching, education, volunteering, or caregiving) as a condition of eligibility for Medicaid expansion benefits. The next day, CMS approved <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/section-1115-demo/demonstration-and-waiver-list/?entry=39258">Kentucky's 2016 waiver application</a>, which included work requirements for some beneficiaries. The new guidance raises both legal and practical <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/guidance-medicaid-work-and-community-engagement-requirements-raises-many-important-questions">questions</a> about the purpose of Medicaid, the relationship between work and health, and the scope of administrative discretion.<br />
 <br />
CMS appears to have two goals: reducing federal and state spending on Medicaid; and reframing Medicaid as a "welfare" program like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). TANF and SNAP are income-support programs with statutory authorization for work requirements. Medicaid, in contrast, is designed to pay providers for medical care for those who cannot pay for it and does not mention work. Work requirements can reduce government spending, because they tend to force many enrollees out of assistance programs for failing to meet complicated eligibility requirements. Yet, work requirements are popular with those who believe that the poor are <a href="http://www.bu.edu/sph/2018/01/23/work-requirements-medicaid-bad-medicine/">idle</a> freeloaders and should "earn" public assistance. If all such programs are framed as part of unearned charity from taxpayers, the stage may be set to consolidate funding for all into a single block grant to the states. Such funding makes a tempting target for budget cuts, leaving fewer benefits for fewer beneficiaries.<br />
 <br />
The new policy signals that CMS is open to restricting eligibility for Medicaid - reversing its historical preference for waivers that expand eligibility and cover additional benefits or more efficient models of service delivery. Congress has not changed the definitions of the populations eligible for Medicaid nor the statutory provisions for waivers. A threshold legal question, therefore, is whether CMS has the statutory authority to approve new limits on eligibility.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Waiver Requirements</strong><br />
Section 1115 of the Social Security Act [<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1315">42 U.S.C. §1315</a>] authorizes CMS to waive some statutory requirements (in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">42 U.S.C. §1396a</a>) to allow states to conduct an "experimental, pilot or demonstration project which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives" of Medicaid. These objectives are stated in the statute's first section authorizing the appropriation of federal funds "[f]or the purpose of enabling each State . . . to furnish (1) medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care." It also requires that medical "assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals. <br />
 <br />
The statute gives CMS considerable discretion (as delegated from the Secretary of Health and Human Services). Regulations add no substantive limits. [42 C.F.R. §§ <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/431.400">431.400</a>-<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/431.416">431.416</a>] But the demonstration project must both (a) serve the purpose of Medicaid and (b) be conducted as an experiment whose results can be evaluated.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Work and Health</strong><br />
The CMS policy asserts that work requirements can improve health, because people who are employed generally have better health than those who are unemployed. It draws on the social determinants of health literature, which does support a correlation between employment and health status. But, as statisticians insist, correlation is not causation. Causation is more likely to go in the opposite direction: good health enables people to work. A <a href="http://www.nationaldisabilitynavigator.org/wp-content/uploads/Materials/CHRIL/AJPH-CHRIL_MedicaidExpansion-WorkforceParticipation_2016-Dec-20.pdf">study</a> [PDF] of programs in Medicaid expansion states that allow persons with disabilities to remain enrolled while earning more than the Medicaid income limit suggests that Medicaid coverage helps them to become employed. By itself, however, employment does not necessarily improve health. Indeed, some occupations pose substantial <a href="http://www.who.int/social_determinants/themes/employmentconditions/en/">health and safety risks</a>. Lack of employment, as well as very low wage jobs, typically lead to <a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/catalog/product/view/id/323363/s/the-health-gap/">poverty</a>, which is a much stronger risk factor for poor health.<br />
 <br />
CMS implies that work requirements will also enable financial independence. But Medicaid's purpose is to "furnish medical assistance" and "rehabilitation and other services," not economic independence. The statute specifies "rehabilitation and other services" to help people - primarily those with disabilities - attain independent physical or mental functioning so that they are not institutionalized. A few court decisions have upheld work requirements for <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2671711">TANF</a>, but those decisions depend on a wholly different statute and have no precedential value for Medicaid. Moreover, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-enrollees-and-work-requirements-lessons-from-the-tanf-experience/">historical evidence</a> suggests that work requirements do not significantly increase employment. <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows">Income</a> earned by TANF enrollees required to work is rarely enough to rise above the poverty level. Many can find only low-wage or part-time jobs without health insurance or other benefits.<br />
 <br />
A practical question is whether proposed new eligibility requirements are likely to affect enough Medicaid enrollees to significantly reduce state expenditures. Kentucky seeks to reduce its Medicaid payment by $2.6 million over five years by moving almost 95,000 people from Medicaid into private commercial health insurance plans. Kentucky has a much greater chance of achieving disenrollment than private coverage or substantial cost savings, because most low-wage jobs do not offer any (or any affordable) health insurance benefits.<br />
 <br />
The proportion of the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/MedicareProgramRatesStats/SummaryMedicareMedicaid.html">Medicaid</a> population that would be subject to work or community engagement requirements is small and does not generate significant costs. The new policy would exempt non-elderly, non-pregnant adults, as well as students and those caring for dependents. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-financing-the-basics-issue-brief/">analysis</a>, 63% of Medicaid dollars pay for the care of <a href="https://www.kff.org/infographic/medicaids-role-for-seniors/">elderly</a> (21%) and disabled (42%) individuals, even though these groups together comprise less than 25% of the Medicaid population. (<a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/distribution-of-medicaid-spending-by-service/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=fee-for-service-long-term-care&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">Long term care</a> alone consumes about 21% of national Medicaid expenditures.) In contrast, children are almost half (48%) the Medicaid population, but account for 21% of Medicaid costs. Adults, including pregnant women, make up the remaining 27% of the population, accounting for 15% of total costs.<br />
 <br />
Thus, only a small fraction of a state's Medicaid population is likely to qualify for work requirements. Among the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-and-work-requirements-new-guidance-state-waiver-details-and-key-issues/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3b2j58SA2QIV3oSzCh2fkwxrEAMYASAAEgJV3PD_Bw">24.5 million non-elderly, adult Medicaid</a> beneficiaries not on SSI in 2016, 42% were working full-time and 18% part-time, while 14% were ill or disabled, 12% were family caregivers, and 6% were in school. That left 7% of a less costly population who were not working for other reasons. It is likely that many of those want a paid job, but were unable to find or hold one, for lack of education, relevant skills, stable housing, transportation, or childcare.<br />
 <br />
Most <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows">successful</a> welfare-to-work programs followed a "human capital development" approach, offering education and training. Even these have had limited success, increasing employment by only a few percentage points. It is unclear how the states would help this group. Federal Medicaid dollars do not pay for non-medical services, so the states would have to find state or private financial and human resources to provide job training and search assistance.<br />
 <br />
The new CMS policy also encourages state waiver plans to include additional eligibility requirements beyond work or community engagement. <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/approved-changes-to-medicaid-in-kentucky/">Kentucky's waiver</a>, which is being <a href="http://www.healthlaw.org/news/press-releases/698-kentuckians-sue-trump-over-radical-changes-to-medicaid">challenged</a> in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, requires enrollees to "earn" medical benefits that are no longer covered by engaging in healthy behaviors, avoiding the emergency department for non-emergencies, and complying with work requirements. Kentucky enrollees must also report any changes in their work/service hours and income within ten days, which can be challenging, especially for people with variable schedules and limited internet access. Paperwork requirements are understood to make compliance difficult and result in disenrollment of eligible, as well as ineligible, individuals. As Gail Wilensky <a href="https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/old-medicaid-gone-expanded-medicaid-stay/?utm_source=Milbank+Email+List&utm_campaign=99250b0717-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_dbce9df54c-99250b0717-3866589">writes</a>, there is no dignity in periodically having to prove you are still poor enough for help.<br />
 <br />
Kentucky also now requires that enrollees pay premiums for Medicaid, which can be up to 4% of household income. Since the target population has income just below or above the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines">federal poverty level</a> (FPL: $12,140 - individual; $25,100 - family of four), premiums can eat up the rent and food budget. The national <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/fact-sheet/where-are-states-today-medicaid-and-chip/">median income eligibility</a> level for adult Medicaid beneficiaries is 44% FPL. Yet failure to pay renders a Kentucky enrollee over 100% FPL no longer eligible (locked-out) for 6 months.<br />
 <br />
A practical and legal issue is whether states applying for waivers will conduct real experiments that can be evaluated, as required by the statute, regulations, and the new policy. [42 U.S.C. §431.424] Most important, an experiment must test whether it furthers Medicaid's purpose: access to "medical assistance." Employment is a means to that end, not the goal. Well-designed evaluations are necessary to confirm or reject assumptions about the value of the new eligibility criteria, as well as how many people are affected. It may be difficult, however, to find people who were removed from Medicaid for noncompliance to compare their results.<br />
 <br />
We don't need to wait to predict the results of such "experiments." Tennessee's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/business/economy/work-medicaid.html?smid=tw-share">experience</a> with reducing Medicaid enrollment left the former beneficiaries in worse financial condition and health. In contrast, the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMsa1212321">Oregon Health Insurance Experiment</a> found that eligible persons selected at random to enroll in Medicaid improved their financial condition by avoiding catastrophic medical bills, compared with eligible persons not selected for enrollment. Rates of depression also decreased, which may enable people to perform better in all facets of life, including employment. A recent <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1706645">review</a> of studies concludes that health insurance coverage saves enrollees money and improves access to care, as well as adherence to medications. Improvements in health outcomes, especially for chronic diseases, have been harder to measure, perhaps because of the time required to alter the trajectory of such conditions.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
Section 1115 waivers give CMS and the states a great deal of flexibility to adapt their programs to more modern and efficient structures. That is the value of administrative discretion. Yet administrative discretion can be abused. When exercised for budgetary or ideological reasons untethered to evidence, it undermines the agency's credibility. It seems clear that the purpose of these new waiver criteria is not to "furnish medical assistance," but to reduce Medicaid enrollment and federal and state spending. The results are likely to cause unnecessary suffering. If this is found to be within CMS's authority, it may be time to rethink the scope of its statutory authority.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu/profiles/khan-ali.html">L. Ali Khan</a> of the <a href="http://washburnlaw.edu">Washburn University School of Law</a> discusses troubling recent trends in the Pakistani Supreme Court...</p>

<p>Judicial activism is a milder label to express what the Pakistan Supreme Court has done over the decades to frame the national constitutional jurisprudence. Since the 1950s, the Court has validated several military coups that overthrew elected governments. It has bestowed powers on the military dictators to single-handedly amend the constitution. The Court has endorsed the execution of a highly popular prime minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, in a "murder" case prosecuted under the thumb of a military ruler. More recently, the Supreme Court has disqualified two elected prime ministers, one for contempt of court and the other on a highly technical ground <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/151531-legal-heavyweights-weigh-in-on-scs-decision-on-panama-case">holding that </a>the failure to report an un-received income is a violation of assets disclosure required under the election laws.</p>

<p>After the failure of the courts to prosecute General Pervez Musharraf for various crimes and letting him <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/pervez-musharraf-leaves-pakistan-for-treatment-after-travel-ban-lifted">leave </a>the country, a popular perception circulates in legal circles that the Supreme Court is hurried in punishing elected representatives for minor misdemeanors but incredibly reluctant to demand accountability from military generals who commit constitutional subversions. Pakistan, some jurists would say, is a country where the generals and justices jointly govern to "protect" constitutional democracy. </p>

<p>In Pakistan, the behavior of the Supreme Court as an institution oscillates with the personality type of the Chief Justice. When a Chief Justice craves no personal fame, the Court retreats into a reclusive mode and decides cases without making needless political waves.  But when a Chief Justice is ambitious in seeking celebrity status, the Court becomes hyperactive in deciding politically explosive cases that may procedurally belong to lower courts.<br />
 <br />
The Supreme Court relies on two controversial judicial concepts, the suo motu jurisdiction to bring provocative cases under its original jurisdiction and the contempt of court punitive powers to fine, imprison, and disqualify parliamentarians, ministers, and prime ministers from public office.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Suo Motu Jurisdiction</strong><br />
<a href="https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-184-original-jurisdiction-of-supreme-court/">Article 184(3)</a> of the Pakistan constitution vests in the Supreme Court "original jurisdiction" over "a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights" enumerated in the constitution.  The Court may exercise original jurisdiction when an aggrieved party files a petition. However, the Court has also exercised original jurisdiction on its own initiative if the Court finds a question of public importance in the domain of constitutional rights needs attention.<br />
 <br />
This self-generated original jurisdiction is called the suo motu jurisdiction. (India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria courts have also invoked the suo motu jurisdiction in various cases of public importance.)<br />
 <br />
The suo motu jurisdiction is a precious tool for a high court to take judicial notice of a pattern of governmental abuse that the state functionaries may refuse to acknowledge or prosecute. For example, a high court may invoke the suo motu jurisdiction to demand state accountability for enforced disappearances and torture of journalists. In a suo motu case, the Pakistan Supreme Court <a href="https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/1994-scmr-1028/">prohibited </a>the "public hangings . . . of even the worst criminals."<br />
 <br />
However, the Supreme Court uses the suo motu jurisdiction to intervene in cases that properly belong to the trial courts. For example, in a recent rape-murder <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/H.R.C.1037_P_2018_dt_29_1_2018.pdf">case</a> of a seven-year-old girl, which shocked the nation, the Court stepped in to oversee the police investigation of the case. Despite the good motive, the Court overlooked the fact that the Pakistani police known to frame innocent persons to "solve" intricate crimes could turn even more untrustworthy if placed under high-pitched pressure.<br />
 <br />
In the same case, the Court also took<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/H.R.C.1037_P_2018_dt_29_1_2018.pdf"> judicial notice</a> of a TV talk show where a news anchor made outrageous accusations involving the defendant. The Court summoned the anchor, along with a dozen other news and media personalities to investigate the accusations. The courtroom scene mimicked a tribal Jirga as different media persons were supplying spontaneous advice to the Justices regarding what needed to be done.</p>

<p>By invoking the suo motu jurisdiction, the Supreme Court harms the function and credibility of trial courts. Furthermore, the provincial high courts are empowered to intervene under the suo motu jurisdiction if such intervention is necessary in select cases.  No harm will occur if the Supreme Court entrust the suo motu jurisdiction to provincial high courts under some supervisory strictures and extricate itself from summary trials of questions raised in the electronic and print media. </p>

<p><strong>Contempt of Court</strong><br />
<a href="https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-204-contempt-of-court/">Article 204</a> of the Pakistan constitution, titled Contempt of Court, vests in the Supreme Court and other High Courts the power to punish any person who disobeys court orders, obstructs the process or scandalizes the court or a Judge of the Court. In 2012, The Supreme Court invoked this constitutional power to <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/395927/judges-were-inclined-towards-disqualifying-gilani-in-contempt-verdict-qadir/">remove</a> Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani, who refused to obey an order. Last week, the Court <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1386800">ordered</a> the imprisonment of a ruling party Senator who "scandalized" the Court through his speeches.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the Supreme Court Chief Justice took suo motu notice of anti-judiciary speeches by a minister and <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1386800">summoned him</a> to appear before the Court. Several petitions have been filed under Article 204 against former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his politically active daughter for giving disrespectful speeches against the Supreme Court Justices who removed the prime minister from office.<br />
  <br />
The <a href="http://www.senate.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1347362846_193.pdf">2012 Contempt of Court Act</a> restricts the consequences of contempt of court by limiting fine and punishments. The Act permits "fair comments about the general working of the courts (or on the merits of a decision of a court) made in good faith in the public interest and in temperate language." The Act provides punishment for contempt but also allows court forgiveness if a bona fide apology is tendered at any stage of the proceeding.<br />
  <br />
Thus, the faultfinders of the Supreme Court and High Courts tread a fine line between permissible criticisms of the Court and its decisions and the constitutionally prohibited scandalization of the Court and its judges. Cases show that the inflammatory language in which the criticism is expressed is a prime factor in contempt convictions. In severe cases of contempt, the Court rejects a bad faith apology tendered merely to escape punishment. <br />
 <br />
Much like the suo motu jurisdiction, the contempt of court provision is trickier in the application and its overuse is potentially injurious to the credibility of the high courts. Given the unfortunate history of the Supreme Court in upholding military coups and refusing to punish defiant military generals either under the suo motu jurisdiction or the contempt of court provision, political parties believe that the Court uses these constitutional weapons only against elected officials, including parliamentarians, ministers, and prime ministers.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
The suo motu jurisdiction is a precious legal tool to protect fundamental rights when state institutions decline to prosecute the perpetrators of torture, enforced disappearances, and extra-judicial killings. Likewise, constitutional protections against willful disobedience of court orders and indiscriminate vilification of judges ensure an independent judiciary committed to furnishing justice under the law. These constitutional instruments are efficacious when used thriftily and only in exceptional cases. As a broad principle, judicial restraint on part of the nation's highest court is a superior value to judicial hyper-activism.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.uark.edu/directory/directory-faculty/uid/uchee/name/Uche-Ewelukwa/">Uch&eacute; Ewelukwa</a> of <a href="https://law.uark.edu/">the University of Arkansas School of Law</a>, discusses the dynamic landscape of trade secret law in a multi-part series. In part 1, she introduces current legal trends in trade secrets ...</p>
<ol type="I"><br />
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>2018 is already proving to be a busy year for trade secret owners, for attorneys that prosecute trade secrets misappropriation cases and for the judges who have to interpret and apply relevant laws. On January 24, 2018, a Wisconsin court <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chinese-company-sinovel-wind-group-convicted-theft-trade-secrets">convicted</a> Chinese wind turbine maker Sinovel Wind Group Co. (Sinovel) of stealing trade secrets from U.S. company American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC). In a lawsuit filed on January 29, 2018, intelligent electric car company Faraday Future <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity">claims</a> its two former executives, CFO Stephan Krause and CTO Ulrich Kranz, stole its trade secrets when they left to form Evelozcity, Inc. Jury selection in the Waymo-Uber trade secret trial <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jury-selected-for-waymo-uber-trial-cm915028">concluded</a> on January 31, 2018; trial was set to start on February 5. What these three cases have in common are breakthrough technological innovations worth millions of dollars, cutthroat competition for global dominance in new and emerging sectors, and highly ambitious and very mobile tech employees. Against the backdrop of the 21st century's impressive technological revolution and a highly competitive marketplace, trade secrets are increasingly recognized as very important business assets.  Reflecting the importance of trade secrets, a growing number of countries are taking unprecedented steps to ramp up their legal and regulatory framework for trade secret protection. Overall, recent studies show that trade secrets are playing a significantly increased role in the brand value and corporate strategies of companies big and small. Business executives that ignore or minimize the role of trade secrets in their corporate strategy do so at their own peril.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>What is a Trade Secret?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/trade_secrets/trade_secrets.htm">According</a> to the World Intellectual Property Organization, "any confidential business information which provides an enterprise a competitive edge" may qualify as a trade secret. In the U.S., the <a href="http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/trade secrets/utsa_final_85.pdf">Uniform Trade Secret Act</a> defines a trade secret as information, that "derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable," and "is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy."  To qualify as trade secrets, three important condition must be met. First, the information must be valuable and must confer a competitive advantage on the owner. Second, the information must not be generally known or readily ascertainable. Third, the owner must take on-going reasonable effort to protect the secrecy.  Famous examples of trade secrets include the Coca Cola formula, Google's search algorithm, and Kentucky Fried Chicken's original recipe. </li></p>

<p><li><strong>Just How Important Are Trade Secrets?</strong></p>

<p>Trade secrets are extremely important to mid-market companies, recent studies suggest. A June 2017 <a href="https://www.bakermckenzie.com/-/media/files/insight/publications/2017/trade-secrets">report</a> by multinational law firm Baker McKenzie found that 82% of senior executives said their trade secrets are an important, if not essential, part of their businesses. The report also found that one in five companies has suffered trade secret theft and that many companies do not know if they have been the victim of trade secret misappropriation.  A July 2017 <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/reports/Trade Secrets Report_en.pdf">report</a> from the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) came to similar conclusions.  In the report the EUIPO concludes that while innovating firms often use both patents and trade secrets to protect their innovations, the use of trade secrets to protect innovations was higher than the of use patents by most types of companies, in most economic sectors and in all Member States</li></p>

<p><li><strong>What Are the Advantages of Trade Secrets Over Patents? </strong></p>

<p>Trade secrets have some advantages over patents, such as:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br />
<li><strong>Broad Subject Matter:</strong> Patent protection is only available for processes, machines, manufactures, or composition of matters. Trade secret protection on the other hand is available over technological innovations, manufacturing processes, marketing plans, compilations, and indeed any information that gives the owner a competitive advantage.  On October 6, 2017, a federal jury entered a $2.1 million trade secret verdict in the case of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4516520591568282243&q=Bimbo+Bakeries+USA,+Inc.+v.+Sycamore&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc. v. Sycamore</span></a>, a case that involved the recipe for making bread. </li></p>

<p><li><strong>No Formal Registration or Examination:</strong> In most jurisdiction, patents are granted by the government after a rigorous examination procedure. No formality or registration is required to enjoy trade secret protection.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Potentially Long Life Span:</strong> Patents generally last for twenty years. A trade secret, on the other hand, can last forever provided it remains relatively secret and is the subject to continuing effort to protect secrecy.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Absolute Novelty Not Required:</strong> The legal requirements for patentability are much more stringent that those for trade secrets and include the requirements of novelty and non-obviousness.</li><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li><strong>Do Patents Have Any Advantages Over Trade Secrets?</strong></p>

<p>Although trade secrets has any advantages over patents, trade secret protection is not ideal for every type of technology and for every company.  Compared to patents, the disadvantages of trade secrets include:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br />
<li><strong>Possibility of Reverse Engineering:</strong>  In the U.S. and many other jurisdiction, it is lawful to reverse engineer a trade secret. A patent on the other hand cannot be reverse engineered.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Ease of loss:</strong> Trade secrets can be lost through theft, industrial espionage, accidental disclosures and willful disclosure in breach of confidential relationships.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Independent Creation:</strong> Independent creation is a complete defense to a trade secret misappropriation claim but is not a defense in a patent suit.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>No Presumption of Validity</strong> In the U.S., a patent is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/282">presumed</a> valid until invalidated by a court. Trade secrets do not enjoy a similar presumption</li><br />
</ul></li><br />
<li><strong>A Changing Legal Landscape?</strong></p>

<p>The legal and regulatory landscape for trade secret protection is changing. First, a growing number of countries are passing specific trade secret laws. Second, countries are ramping up the penalties for trade secret theft. Third, some jurisdictions like the European Union (EU) are taking step to harmonize their trade secret laws. <br />
<ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br />
<li><strong>European Union:</strong> EU countries have until June 9, 2018 to bring their domestic legislation into compliance with <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016L0943">Directive (EU) 2016/943</a>, protecting trade secrets against unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure. The Directive was adopted on May 26, 2016, and aims at harmonizing the trade secret laws of EU Member States.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>China:</strong>  The <a href="https://www.dimt.it/images/pdf/GeneralRules.pdf">General Provisions of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China</a> was adopted at the 5th Session of the Twelfth National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on March 15, 2017, and became effective October 1, 2017. Article 123 confirms that trade secrets are recognized and protected as a form of intellectual property in China.</li> </p>

<p><li><strong>United States:</strong>  In May 2016, the U.S. Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1890/text">Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016</a> ("DTSA"), which creates a brand new federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation.  Section 2 of the DTSA states unequivocally that "[a]n owner of a trade secret that is misappropriated may bring a civil action."  Before the DTSA, trade secret was primarily protected under state law. </li></p>

<p><li><strong>Japan:</strong> <a href="http://www.jonesday.com/files/Publication/2b509a75-1a2e-4a7d-8b32-6c82a6edeb8d/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/b7bb32d1-b712-4021-b090-7c98eceee9b4/Japan_Strengthens_Deterrence_Measures.pdf">Amendments</a> to Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act became effective on January 1, 2016. Among other things, the amendments expanded the punishment for the theft of trade secrets.</li></p>

<p><li><strong>Subnational Governments (e.g. the State of Texas):</strong> On 19 May 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/pdf/HB01995F.pdf#navpanes=0">House Bill 1995</a>, which amends several provisions of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act to bring it into conformity with the DTSA.</li><br />
</ul></li></p>

<p><li><strong>What Lessons for Businesses?</strong></p>

<p>Long regarded as the stepchild of intellectual property rights, trade secrets are gradually coming into their own and are increasingly at the center of multi-million dollar lawsuits between major tech titans. The good news is that legal protection for trade secret is becoming stronger in a growing number of countries. The bad news is that with increased digitization, globalization, and the growing popularity of electronic communication technologies, trade secrets are extremely vulnerable to theft and unauthorized disclosure especially in sectors with high employee mobility. In Waymo v. Uber, a former Waymo employee allegedly stole 14,000 electronic files shortly before he left Waymo.  At the center of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sinovel-wind-gro-usa-court/chinas-sinovel-convicted-in-u-s-of-trade-secret-theft-idUSKBN1FD2XL">Sinovel's trade secret theft scandal</a> is Dejan Karabesevic, a former employee of a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMSC. On January 18, 2018, Xu Jiaquiang a former software developer for IBM Corp. was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-crime-china/ex-ibm-employee-from-china-gets-five-years-prison-for-stealing-code-idUSKBN1F82P9">sentenced</a> to five years in prison for stealing trade secrets belonging to IBM.</p>

<p>Patent or trade secrets? That is a tough question. The choice of protection strategy will frequently depend on a number of factors including the subject matter of innovation (whether production or process), the nature of the trade secret and the marketplace, the risk of disclosure, as well as business considerations such as the desire to sustain exclusivity for an extended period of time. Overall, evidence suggests that innovating firms tend to combine patents with secrecy and use both to protect different aspects of their innovation. Companies choosing to rely on trade secrets must ensure the security of their innovations using a mix of physical security measures, legal (contractual) measures, and technological security measures.</li></ol></p>

In part 2, she discusses the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 ...</p>
<ol type="I"><br />
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Signed into law on May 11, 2016, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1890/text">Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016</a> ("DTSA") creates a new federal private right of civil action for trade secrets misappropriation. Section 2 of the DTSA states unequivocally that "[a]n owner of a trade secret that is misappropriated may bring a civil action."  One of the most significant provisions of the DTSA is the <em>ex parte</em> seizure provision. The <em>ex parte</em> seizure provision gives trade secret owners the right, in extraordinary circumstances, to request the court to order the seizure of property if necessary to prevent the propagation or dissemination of the trade secret that is the subject of an action. Are attorneys requesting <em>ex parte</em> seizure orders and are courts granting such requests? The questions are important because oftentimes there is an urgent need for a company to stop a departing employee or a former business partner from taking or disclosing proprietary information. In an explosive new lawsuit filed in January 2018, Faraday Futures <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity">alleges</a> that a former executive, Bill Strickland, "copied and took potentially thousands of FF's most sensitive electronic documents from his FF computer and FF's servers." Tan Liu, a former employee of Rockwell Automation, Inc., was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity">charged</a> (since <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2018/01/30/chinese-engineer-acquitted-charges-he-stole-trade-secrets-rockwell-automation/1077166001/">acquitted</a>) with 12 counts of stealing trade secrets from Rockwell. Just before he left Rockwell, Liu allegedly downloaded 2,500 files containing Rockwell's proprietary software and source code.</li></p>

<p><li><strong><em>Ex Parte</em> Seizure Order Under the DTSA</strong> <br />
Under the DTSA, a court may issue an <em>ex parte</em> seizure order "only in extraordinary circumstances."  Courts appear to be reluctant to grant <em>ex parte</em> seizure orders and are granting it only in truly extraordinary circumstances. In <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2399&context=historical"><span class="casename">Mission Capital Advisors LLC v. Romaka</span></a>, the court awarded the first, and possibly the only, DTSA seizure order in the U.S. to date. In this case, Plaintiff Mission Capital Advisors LLC ("Mission") accused an employee, Romaka, of downloading confidential company files including contact lists. Forensic examination of Romaka's personal desktop had revealed that he had indeed downloaded a multitude of company files. Plaintiff requested a seizure order. When the defendant failed to acknowledge service or to show up for hearing, the court ordered the United States Marshals Service ("U.S. Marshal") to copy onto a storage medium and delete specific files (the Contact Lists of Plaintiff Mission Capital Advisors LLC.) on the Defendant's computer.</p>

<p>A request for an <em>ex parte</em> seizure order was denied in <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.orrick.com/files/BaleariaCaribbeanLtdCorpvCalvo08052016.pdf"><span class="casename">Balearia Caribbean Ltd., Corp., v. Calvo</span></a>. Plaintiff Balearia Caribbean Ltd., Corp. (''BCL'') alleged that its former Chief Executive Officer, Hernan Calvo, misappropriated its trade secrets. Just before he left BCL, Calvo had his personal laptop computer reconfigured to access Balearia's electronic information systems and secretly inserted an electronic command into his BCL email addresses to ensure that all email communications he received would be surreptitiously forwarded in their entirety to his private G-mail account. Nevertheless, the court denied BCL's request to seize Calvo's personal computer concluding that the applicant failed to demonstrate the "extraordinary circumstances contemplated by the DTSA."</p>

<p>    In <a href="http://business.cch.com/ipld/OOOBrunswickRailMgmtSultanov20170106.pdf"><span class="casename">OOO Brunswick Rail Management v. Sultanov</span></a>, plaintiffs OOO Brunswick Rail Management and Brunswick Rail Group Limited ("Brunswick") alleged that defendants, former employees, Richard Sultanov and Paul Ostling, misappropriated Brunswick's confidential information. Plaintiff filed an <em>ex parte</em> application for inter alia a seizure order under the DTSA, a seizure and preservation order under Rule 65, and expedited discovery. The court granted the request for a seizure and preservation order under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_65">Rule 65</a> but denied the request for a seizure order pursuant to the DTSA concluding that seizure under the DTSA was unnecessary because an order under Rule 65 was adequate.</p>

<p>Attorneys appear to be using the DTSA's <em>ex parte</em> seizure process sparingly and are instead opting for temporary restraining orders (TROs) and orders for expedited discovery. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10464683163995364161&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"><span class="casename">Henry Schein, Inc. v. Cook, Henry Schein, Inc</span></a>. (HSI) alleged that defendant and former employee Jennifer Cook looted confidential data, failed to return her laptop for two weeks after she stopped working for HSI, unlawfully accessed HSI's computer system after her resignation and attempted to erase the e-mails that she sent from her HSI computer. Granting the plaintiff's request for a TRO, the court ordered the defendant to "immediately preserve all documents, data, tangible things, and other materials relating to th[e] case." The defendant was also enjoined "from altering, destroying, or disposing of any evidence or other materials, in any form, relating to th[e] action," and "from directly or indirectly accessing, using, disclosing, or making available to any person or entity other than Plaintiff, any of HSI's confidential, proprietary, or trade secret documents, data or information." </p>

<p>So what can we learn from the handful of cases that have addressed the DTSA's <em>ex parte</em> seizure provisions?</p>

<p>First, courts are reluctant to issue <em>ex parte</em> seizure orders. The only <em>ex parte</em> seizure order under the Act to date is that issued in Mission Capital Advisors LLC v. Romaka. </p>

<p>Second, courts appear to be more willing to allow more common forms of pre-trial relief, such as expedited discovery and TROs. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12241278079668814312&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"><span class="casename">Dazzle Software II v. Kinney</span></a>, the court denied plaintiff's request for civil seizure of computers and computer storage devices pursuant to the DTSA but granted in part a motion for expedited discovery that permitted the plaintiff to take the depositions of several key witnesses.</p>

<p>Third, a lot can be achieved with an "ordinary" TRO under Rule 65. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16775707441398917001&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"><span class="casename">Earthbound Corporation v. MiTek USA, Inc.</span></a>, the TRO required the defendant to inter alia "immediately deliver to a neutral third-party expert ... all flash drives, SD cards, cell phones, and other external drives ... that are in Defendants' possession, custody, or control," for forensic imaging at defendants' expense. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13272751740076524748&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"><span class="casename">Panera, LLC v. Nettles</span></a>, the court ordered the defendant to provide his personal laptop and any other materials that may have housed plaintiff's information for review and inspection. </p>

<p>Fourth, even if a plaintiff is successful in getting an <em>ex parte</em> seizure order, such an order is likely to be limited. The DTSA stipulates that <em>ex parte</em> seizure orders shall "provide for the narrowest seizure of property necessary to achieve the purpose of [the statute]."  Not surprising, in Mission Capital Advisors LLC v. Romaka, the court only allowed the seizure of a single document, a contact list. </li></p>

<p><li><strong>Conclusions</strong><br />
	<br />
The legal and regulatory landscape for trade secret protection is changing in the United States and around the world. The usefulness of some of the recent laws are beginning to be tested in courts. Although an important piece of legislation, reliance the DTSA's <em>ex parte</em> seizure provision is still limited but is likely to grow. When it comes to using trade secret to protect innovations, extreme vigilance backed-up by appropriate contractual, technological and physical security measures remains the word. However, where an invention is patentable, the risk of disclosure is high, and reverse engineering is highly possible, a company would be well advised to consider patents over trade secrets. </li><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Steve Koslovsky discusses how more judicial elections harm judicial independence...</p>

                <p>Remember Rose Bird? Back in 1986, Chief Justice Rose E. Bird, who was the first female Chief on the California Supreme Court, became the first Chief Justice <correction num=1>removed from office</correction>. In a campaign organized largely by California conservatives and funded by business interests, voters  <a href="https://www.cschs.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CSCHS_2007-Brown.pdf">removed her</a> [PDF] from office largely based on her perceived liberal political views and consistent opposition to the death penalty.</p>

                <p>Prior to her appointment to the Court, Bird had served as a public defender for eight years in Santa Clara County, and taught at Stanford Law School for two years. She <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-rose-bird-19991205-story.html">died</a> in 1999.</p>

                <p>I mention Bird's connections with Santa Clara County and Stanford University because feminist activists in the San Francisco area, led by another professor at Stanford Law School, are now seeking to remove by <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brock-turner-judge-recall_us_5a7a1464e4b06505b4e8daaa">recall election </a>Santa Clara County Superior Judge Aaron Persky for what they allege was an excessively lenient sentence of six months in jail, followed by three years' probation, successful completion of a state sex offender rehabilitation program and lifelong registration as a sex offender, which Judge Persky gave to Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner, who had been found guilty of felony sexual assault of an incapacitated young woman in 2016.</p>

                <p>The required signatures on the Persky recall petition were recently certified and the election is set for June of this year. One wonders whether the "liberal" Justice Bird would support or oppose the Persky recall effort. In addition to direct election of judges, and periodic retention elections for appointed judges, there are <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials.aspx">eight states </a>which allow judicial recall elections. Of those, five states, including California, require no legal grounds whatsoever to support such a recall. Proponents need only satisfy the requirements for the number of signatures of registered voters, which varies from 10 to 30% of the voters who cast ballots in the last election for the office in question.</p>

                <p>Three states (Georgia, Minnesota, and Montana) require that the petition state certain grounds for the recall. Among these are malfeasance, misconduct, failure to perform duties of the office, or conviction of a serious crime while in office. Georgia and Montana specifically exclude as grounds for recall the discretionary performance of a lawful act or mandatory duty.</p>

                <p>However, even those states which require the petition to state grounds for recall have no mechanism in place to test the accuracy of a recall petition's stated grounds. Conviction of a serious crime is an objective standard, but what about "malfeasance," "misconduct," or "failure to perform the duties of the office"? Would Justice Bird's opposition to the death penalty satisfy one of these grounds? How about Judge Persky's alleged lenient sentence? In those two states that exclude "discretionary performance of a lawful act," probably not. Elsewhere, in today's hyper-partisan world, it is not difficult to imagine arguments spun on both sides.</p>

                <p>It is certainly not news that judicial elections of every kind have become ever more politicized. Recall elections represent but another tool in the ongoing effort to politically influence the judiciary, from both the right and the left. However, recall elections have one distinct advantage over other judicial elections: they can be forced at any time so long as enough signatures are gathered on a properly worded petition.  (Judge Persky, for example, would not be up for retention election until 2022). With the financial and organizational support of powerful political interests, these petition requirements are a low bar to clear. </p>

                <p>Recall elections have the potential to subject judges to possible removal based on the political winds of the moment. Remember the 2010 judicial election in which three members of the Iowa Supreme Court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/us/politics/04judges.html">were removed</a> based on their vote in the unanimous decision to strike down a prohibition on same sex marriage?</p>

                <p>Many commentators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/24/us/24judges.html">agree</a> that judicial elections of all kinds, whether direct election to office, retention election after appointment, or recall elections based on voter petition, should be entirely eliminated from our judicial system. Judges should instead be appointed and evaluated based on their overall competence, and not how they rule on highly publicized cases. Otherwise, only the most courageous of future judges will be willing to risk political fallout from ruling as they feel they must in any notorious case.</p>

                <p>Whether you agree or disagree with Justice Bird&#8217;s view of capital punishment, the Iowa Supreme Court&#8217;s view of same-sex marriage, or the sentence handed down by Judge Persky in a high-profile criminal case, removal of judges with whom we disagree politically, whether initiated by the right or the left, can only lead to further politicization of the judicial branch of government.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>T</strong>he unseemly haste of the recently elected Democratic Party majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has undermined the impact of a path breaking decision to void Pennsylvania's current congressional district map as an unconstitutional political gerrymander under the State Constitution. The four votes in favor of the decision in <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/setting-6015/file-6790.pdf?cb=842ff7">League of Women Voters v. Commonwealth</a> [PDF] were cast by three Democratic Justices elected in a partisan judicial election in November, 2015-<a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/justice-christine-donohue">Christine Donohue</a>, <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/justice-kevin-m-dougherty">Kevin Dougherty</a> and <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/justice-david-n-wecht">David Wecht</a>-joined by holdover Democratic Justice <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/justice-debra-mccloskey-todd">Debra Todd</a>.

The Republicans on the Court, Chief Justice <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/justice-thomas-g-saylor">Thomas Saylor</a> and <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices/judge-sallie-updyke-mundy">Sallie Mundy</a>, <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/Dissenting%20Statement%20%20GrantedJurisdiction%20Retained%20%2010339890932033722.pdf?cb=1">both</a> [PDF] <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/Dissenting%20Statement%20%20GrantedJurisdiction%20Retained%20%2010339890932033753.pdf?cb=1">dissented</a> [PDF].

Currently, Pennsylvania may have the most perfectly gerrymandered congressional map in America. <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/LI/US/PDF/2011/0/0131..PDF">The Congressional Redistricting Act of 2011</a>, referred to in the opinion as the 2011 Plan, has yielded the same 13-5 Republican/Democratic congressional delegation split in the three congressional elections that have used it. This pattern held even though the Republican share of the overall State vote for the House of Representatives has ranged from 49.2% in 2012 to 55.5% and 54.1% in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and the Democratic share has ranged from 50.8% in 2012 to 44.5% in 2014 and 45.9% in 2016. Barring the equivalent of a political earthquake, the result would have been exactly the same in 2018. In Pennsylvania, you don't actually have to hold a congressional election. You can just anoint the winners.

These political results were accomplished through skillful manipulation of congressional district lines, including dividing small municipalities into different congressional districts. The consequence is some of the most grotesquely shaped districts in America, including the 7th Congressional District, often referred to as "Goofy kicking Donald Duck."

Justice Todd's majority opinion held that the 2011 Plan violated <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=00&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=1">Art. I, Section 5</a> of the Pennsylvania Constitution:
<blockquote>Elections shall be free and equal; and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.</blockquote>
The majority held that Section 5 requires assessment of congressional vote dilution claims by the neutral and objective criteria of "compactness, contiguity, minimization of the division of political subdivisions, and maintenance of population equality among congressional districts," which are traditionally used in assessing the constitutionality of Pennsylvania legislative districting plans. The majority added that these factors constitute a "'floor'" and that a congressional districting plan could minimally comply with these criteria and yet still "unfairly dilute the power of a particular group's vote for a congressional representative." Because the "neutral criteria were subordinated to the pursuit of partisan political advantage" in the 2011 Plan, it could be struck down without consideration of how a different kind of gerrymandering claim might be made out in the future.

The majority opinion in the case was issued on February 7, 2018. But the holding was announced earlier, in a <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/Order%20%20GrantedJurisdiction%20Retained%20%2010339890932033626.pdf?cb=1">per curiam order</a> [PDF] on January 22, 2018. That order held the 2011 Plan unconstitutional, set forth the neutral criteria described above, and directed that if the General Assembly and the Governor could not agree on a new plan by February 15, 2018, the Court would itself draft a congressional redistricting plan that would control the 2018 election cycle. Chief Justice Saylor and Justice Mundy dissented from the order and Justice Baer dissented in part.

The order was denounced by Republicans as an unconstitutional, partisan judicial usurpation. On January 26, 2018, the legislative defendants, President of the Senate, Michael Turzai, and Speaker of the House, Joseph Scarnati III, filed an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17A795/33542/20180129130841548_Amicus%20Submission%20of%20Secretaries%20of%20State.pdf">emergency application for a stay</a> [PDF] with the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on February 5, 2018. Mr. Scarnati later refused by letter to turn over election data to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court "[i]n light of the unconstitutionality of the court's Orders and the Court's plain intent to usurp the General Assembly's constitutionally delegated role of drafting Pennsylvania's congressional districting plan... ." This reaction obscured consideration of gerrymandering in a fog of partisan recriminations.

That partisan reaction was not inevitable. It was clear from Chief Saylor's dissent, joined by Justice Mundy, that, under other circumstances, he might have found the 2011 Plan unconstitutional. Chief Justice Saylor objected in major part to the process through which the decision unfolded, especially-and here Justice Baer agreed-the decision to apply a new congressional districting plan to the 2018 election cycle. That timetable amounted to a disruptive interference with an election campaign already well underway and precluded thoughtful consideration of either a new plan, or the legal standard that should be applied in evaluating gerrymandering claims.

The rush by the majority to decide the gerrymandering issue and apply the decision in 2018 was apparent early in the litigation. Although the case could have been brought any time after the 2012 general election, it was filed in Commonwealth Court on June 15, 2017, less than a year before the scheduled May 15, 2018 primary elections. In the normal course of litigation, that filing date by itself would have precluded application of a new congressional map in 2018.

Then, on October 16, 2017, after oral argument in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/16-1161_bpm1.pdf">Gill v. Whitford</a> [PDF], the Wisconsin political gerrymander case brought on federal equal protection grounds, Judge <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court-judges/president-judge-dan-pellegrini">Dan Pellegrini</a> granted a stay of proceedings pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in that case. That stay was reasonable, even given the purely State law theories of the petitioners, because the major precedent interpreting Art. I, Section 5 in a political gerrymandering context, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/2002/j-71-2002mo.html">Erfer v. Commonwealth</a>, had specifically held that the provision granted no greater protection than does the federal <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html">Equal Protection Clause. </a>

Despite this substantial basis for the stay, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on November 9, 2017 granted petitioners' application for extraordinary relief-the Court's famed <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/setting-2236/file-1741.pdf?cb=b40ffc">King's Bench power</a> [PDF] assumed plenary jurisdiction of the case, dissolved the stay and remanded to Commonwealth Court with directions to conduct discovery, pre-trial and trial proceedings in order "to create an evidentiary on which Petitioners' claims may be decided," by December 31, 2017. Chief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer and Mundy dissented. Given that extraordinarily compressed timetable, it was obvious that a four-Justice majority had already decided to abrogate Erfer, find the 2011 Plan unconstitutional and substitute a new plan for use in 2018.

The decision by the majority in League of Women Voters to apply a new districting plan in 2018 has been widely praised in the media by law professors and other legal experts. But this praise is short-sighted. It fails to appreciate how political gerrymandering must be combatted.

It has often been pointed out, in defending the Constitution from the charge that it is anti-democratic, that the framers were more interested in protecting rights from majorities than they were in promoting democracy. That is certainly true.

But, because of the structural advantages in the Electoral College and in the U.S. Senate, and because of successful gerrymandering, America is now faced with the prospect of more or less permanent, and certainly persistent, minority Party rule. That prospect, plus a new willingness on the part of both major political Parties to enact important policy initiatives with no input from the other Party, means that American democratic legitimacy is seriously in question.

The framers would not have endorsed our current situation. They undoubtedly would have agreed with Justice Hugo Black when he asserted (<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html">In re Winship</a>, dissenting) that "the right of self-government that our Constitution preserves is just as important as any of the specific individual freedoms preserved in the Bill of Rights."

The right of self-government cannot be protected unless Americans of all political persuasions agree that the composition of the House of Representatives must basically reflect the national congressional vote. Gerrymandering is morally and politically wrong because it prevents self-government. But, gerrymandering will not be abolished until its unrighteousness is acknowledged in a national consensus without regard to Party.

Chief Justice Saylor's dissent made it clear that he is open to such a consensus. He noted specifically that the 2011 Plan may involve the kind of "extreme partisan gerrymandering" that requires judicial intervention. He wrote that he simply could not engage in the necessary deliberative process to reach that conclusion, given the Court's "extreme exigency."

Given political realities, to begin a candid national conversation about gerrymandering, it was necessary for the Republican Chief Justice to join in the decision that the 2011 Plan was unconstitutional. His agreement would have altered the political context both here in Pennsylvania and nationally. And a unanimous decision, even if it had taken an additional year to forge, would really have gained national attention. Instead, the impatience of the four-Justice majority precluded that outcome and ensured that consideration of gerrymandering would founder in our current partisan political paralysis.

As of Friday, February 10, 2018, it was unclear how the case would ultimately turn out. The Republican leadership had drafted a new congressional districting map that certainly came closer to satisfying the neutral criteria required by the Court. Democratic Governor <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov">Tom Wolf</a> was considering the new plan. Whether that plan is accepted, or the Court imposes one of its own, and whatever the political fallout of that action might be, one conclusion is certain. The decision by a bare majority of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to press its advantage and forge ahead, although a victory against gerrymandering in the short run, has sabotaged formation of the broad-based consensus that is needed to address gerrymandering and numerous other national problems.

Hodge, Jr.</a>, Jennifer Piatt, Sarah Wetter, and Alexandra Hess of the <a href="https://law.asu.edu">Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University </a>discuss the recent reversal of long-standing guidance from the Obama Administration on federal marijuana enforcement... </p>

<p><strong>O</strong>n January 4, 2018, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-issues-memo-marijuana-enforcement">issued</a> a Department of Justice (DOJ) Memorandum announcing the immediate rescission of permissive guidance from the Obama Administration on enforcement of federal drug laws governing marijuana. Many predicted this policy reversal since for years Mr. Sessions has <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/jeff-sessions-marijuana-quotes-about-pot-570177">expressed</a> his disdain for legalizing marijuana.<br />
 <br />
President Obama's prior guidance instructed federal prosecutors to ease back on marijuana-related criminal charges. Instead, they were to focus on large-scale, commercial marijuana production facilities, prevent minors' access, and curb illegal sales, trafficking, and drugged driving. Congress acquiesced via passage of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/244/text">Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment</a>, a legislative rider prohibiting DOJ from spending certain funds on marijuana prosecutions for conduct permissible under relevant state law. Mr. Sessions also requested that this rider be <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/jeff-sessions-marijuana-216109">removed</a> from future spending bills.<br />
 <br />
DOJ's substantial policy shift falls in line with marijuana's classification as a Schedule I drug since the inception of the federal <a href="https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml">Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970</a>. For decades the drug has been legally cast as having a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical efficacy. In 2016, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/08/12/2016-17960/denial-of-petition-to-initiate-proceedings-to-reschedule-marijuana">denied</a> a petition to reschedule marijuana as a Schedule II drug citing insufficient evidence on safety or medical efficacy.<br />
 <br />
Beginning with California's <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=11362.5">Compassionate Use Act of 1996</a>, nearly <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx">30 states</a> now authorize medicinal (and in some cases <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/marijuana-overview.aspx">recreational</a>) uses of the drug despite major legal challenges. Mr. Sessions' policy reversal launches a new chapter in the ongoing saga over marijuana, reflecting an intent to return to a bygone era. State and local governments <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/marijuana-tax-legalization-federal-revenue/">reaping new revenues</a> from the sale and distribution of marijuana are likely disinclined to turn back time. Equally reluctant are marijuana producers, medical practitioners, and patients enjoying widespread medical uses of marijuana (especially for chronic pain).<br />
 <br />
We explore below the balance at the heart of medical marijuana debates between the health of populations and the prospective rights and interests of producers, practitioners, and users in key U.S. jurisdictions.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Evidentiary Conundrums Underlying Medical Marijuana</strong><br />
 <br />
No drug may have been politicized more than marijuana in the last half-century. Yet, public perceptions of the one-time "gateway" drug are changing. Recent polls show increasing support for legal medicinal and recreational marijuana use. In 2016, <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/194195/adults-say-smoke-marijuana.aspx">1 in 8 Americans</a> reported using marijuana regularly; 43% said they had previously tried it; and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/support-for-marijuana-legalization-at-all-time-high/">85%</a> support medical marijuana despite limited evidence surrounding its utility.<br />
 <br />
Marijuana's Schedule I classification is a major barrier to obtaining authorization, funding, and high-quality cannabis for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm421163.htm">researchers</a> to examine its viable use and impacts. Clinical <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2338251">evidence</a> on the proper conditions, dosage, and potency of marijuana treatments is lacking.<br />
 <br />
Still, there is a limited evidence base for medical marijuana. The National Academies have recognized that marijuana can alleviate <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24625/chapter/6">chronic pain</a> by 30% and lessen muscle <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24625/chapter/6">spasticity</a> in patients with multiple sclerosis. It can reduce <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24625/chapter/6">chemotherapy-induced nausea</a> in cancer patients. Moderate evidence also supports improvement through marijuana use among patients with <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24625/chapter/6#121">sleep disorders</a>. Conversely, it is <a href="https://www.compassionatecertificationcenters.com/list-of-qualifying-health-conditions-for-medical-marijuana-in-each-state/">prescribed</a> for a <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/24625/chapter/6#86">number of conditions</a> (e.g., glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, cancers, irritable bowel syndrome) for which its efficacy is insufficiently studied or found to be insignificant.<br />
 <br />
Over-prescribing of marijuana would not be problematic per se except for its known  individual and societal health risks. Even a <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana">single dose</a> can cause anxiety, impaired movement, and hallucinations. Long-term uses can increase risks of elevated heart rate and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects.htm">blood pressure</a>, substance abuse, and <a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR">chronic bronchitis</a>. Evidence suggests a 5-fold increased risk for <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(14)00117-5/fulltext">schizophrenia</a> in frequent high-potency users. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/marijuana-pregnancy.html">Pregnant women</a> using marijuana face more than double the risk of <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/121113-stillbirth-drug-use">stillbirths</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/marijuana-pregnancy.html">newborns</a> exposed during pregnancy are at higher risk for low birthweight.<br />
 <br />
Youth marijuana use is linked to cognitive impairment and a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/40/E2657">loss of IQ</a>. Kids' unintended ingestion of edible marijuana products resulted in a 34% increase in hospitalizations in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2534480">Colorado</a> in the 2 years following its legalization. Operating a motor vehicle under the influence of marijuana makes drivers <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e536">twice as likely</a> to cause a vehicular collision.  <br />
 <br />
<strong>Emergence of Medical Marijuana Laws</strong><br />
 <br />
Passage of California's Compassionate Use Act in 1996 reflected a major shift in American cannabis policy grounded in medical uses. Over the next 2 decades more than half the states enacted medical marijuana laws with varied provisions.</p>

<p>Several <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/qualifying-conditions-for-medical-marijuana-by-state">states</a> limit marijuana's prescription to only a handful of specified conditions (e.g., chronic pain, nausea, seizure disorders, glaucoma). Others like <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/03-04/bill/sen/sb_0401-0450/sb_420_bill_20031012_chaptered.html">California</a> allow prescriptions for any "chronic or persistent medical symptom" limiting patients' everyday activities or seriously impairing their health. States differ on whether and how many <a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/rl00kj/Medical-marijuana-programs.pdf">dispensaries</a> [PDF] are licensed, or if marijuana can be home-cultivated by patients or caregivers. All states enforce marijuana possession (or cultivation) limits, ranging from 1 ounce (AK, MT) to 24 ounces (OR).<br />
 <br />
<a href="https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org">Opponents</a>' arguments to preclude marijuana's legalization largely center on the:</p>

<blockquote><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>paucity of scientific evidence demonstrating marijuana's efficacy to treat various conditions;</li>
<li>existence of FDA-approved drugs to treat conditions supposedly improved by marijuana;</li>
<li>potential for even healthy adults to be prescribed marijuana; and</li>
<li>hardships employers may experience in maintaining drug-free workplaces.</li>
</ul></li></blockquote>

<p><br />
These arguments have been advanced to remove medical marijuana initiatives from voting ballots. Even where legalized at the state level, some cities and counties have <a href="http://cannabusinesslaw.com/california-cannabis-laws-by-county/">banned</a> dispensaries or cultivation within their boundaries via zoning and land use provisions.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Looming Legal and Political Objections</strong><br />
 <br />
Decades of divergent legal approaches among states have complicated national control of marijuana. The specter of renewed federal prosecutions raised by Mr. Sessions could chill or reverse ongoing activities among pro-marijuana states or stymie further <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/statement-us-attorney-andrew-e-lelling-regarding-federal-marijuana-enforcement">jurisdictions from supporting its legalization.</a> As one U.S. Attorney surmised, "certain categories of participants in the state-level marijuana trade [may no longer] be immune from federal prosecution."<br />
 <br />
However, the impact of DOJ's guidance is <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/will-a-us-attorney-bust-up-pot-businesses-after-jeff-sessions-policy-change/article/2645166">uncertain</a> given limited prosecutorial resources, interests, and legal or political objections. Several <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-co/pr/us-attorney-bob-troyer-issues-statement-regarding-marijuana-prosecutions-colorado">U.S. Attorneys</a> openly suggested they will continue to follow DOJ's prior guidance. Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/governor-wolf-pennsylvania-will-protect-medical-marijuana-patients-federal-overreach/">Governor Tom Wolfe</a> avowed he "would continue to do everything in [his] power to protect Pennsylvania patients" from unwarranted federal prosecutions.<br />
 <br />
California <a href="http://ltg.ca.gov/news.2018.01.04_FederalMarijuanaPolicy.html">Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom</a> promised to pursue "all legal, legislative and political options to protect" states' rights. Some localities in California are already taking action. San Francisco and San Diego have begun to erase thousands of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/us/california-marijuana-san-francisco.html">misdemeanor convictions</a> for marijuana possession. California Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer recently revived a stalled state bill seeking to make California a "<a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-lawmaker-will-revive-proposal-to-make-1515109833-htmlstory.html">sanctuary state</a>" for the marijuana industry by refusing to provide certain information to federal agents.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Structural Legal Challenges</strong><br />
 <br />
Additional legal arguments countering DOJ's policy play off a favorable landscape regarding federal preemption. The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/555/555/">assumes</a> that regulations within the realm of the state police powers (including <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/331/218/">drug laws</a>) should not be superseded by federal law unless Congress explicitly intends. CSA's "<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title21/pdf/USCODE-2011-title21-chap13-subchapI-partF-sec903.pdf">preemption disclaimer</a>" [PDF] expressly indicates that federal overrides only apply when a "positive conflict" exists between federal and state laws.<br />
 <br />
Courts and state attorneys general have <a href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&context=jhclp">broadly interpreted</a> [PDF] this provision to allow states some latitude to regulate medical marijuana issues. <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2266680/county-of-san-diego-v-san-diego-norml/">California courts</a>, for example, have held that state law conflicts with CSA only where it is impossible to comply with both laws. Under this view, California and other states could reasonably <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/517/25/">argue</a> that their medical marijuana laws neither require what CSA prohibits nor prohibit what federal law requires. In other words, it is legally possible to comply with both laws. Of course, state court interpretations cannot preclude federal prosecutions.<br />
           <br />
States may also argue that they are not required to enforce CSA. Under principles of federalism, state officials cannot be "<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/898/">commandeered</a>" to enforce federal law. However, in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/545/1/">Gonzales v. Raich</a>, the Supreme Court held that Congress could prohibit local marijuana cultivation and use even where a citizen complied with applicable state law.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Rights-based Arguments Via Constitutional Cohesion</strong><br />
 <br />
Alternatively, states might consider arguments grounded in rights-based principles consistent with theories of "<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073110517750608">constitutional cohesion</a>." Whenever government engages in some restricted vice (e.g., tyranny, malfeasance, oppression, or, in this case, federal overreaching) structural and rights-based principles may present equally viable constitutional objections. From this framework may arise rights-based challenges grounded in the 9th Amendment (retention of rights not specifically enumerated) and Due Process Clause limitations on governmental infringement of <a href="https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1341&context=law_journal_law_policy">fundamental rights</a> [PDF].<br />
 <br />
To date, courts have declined to find a fundamental right in the possession, use, or cultivation of medical marijuana. Yet, in its 2015 report, the Congressional Research Service intimated how a rights-based argument may prove more <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43435.pdf">successful</a> than structural-based federalism objections.<br />
 <br />
Increased state support may also lead to reconsideration of medical marijuana use as a fundamental right. On remand from Gonzales v. Raich, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that medical marijuana use had gained some legal traction. Still it <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1451522.html">found</a> no fundamental right to use medical marijuana because legal recognition of that right had not yet reached the point of being fundamental. In 2011, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/inadvfdco130124000154">a California district court agreed</a>, noting the difficulty of harmonizing a right with CSA's conclusion that marijuana lacks medical efficacy.<br />
 <br />
This argument persists nevertheless as the number of jurisdictions allowing medical marijuana has <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx#3">almost doubled</a> from 2011 to present.  In July 2017, several individuals and the Cannabis Cultural Association sued DOJ and Mr. Sessions, among others, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/362505297/Washington-v-Sessions-Amended-Complaint-to-deschedule-Marijuana">alleging</a> that the CSA is unconstitutional to the extent it prohibits possession and use of marijuana. Prominent among the plaintiffs' claims are constitutional infringements grounded in the 9th Amendment, Due Process Clause, and First Amendment. The suit is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/nyregion/marijuana-lawsuit-trump-sessions.html">pending</a> in Manhattan in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. </p>

<p>Unmitigated, non-regulated access to marijuana for medicinal (or other) purposes is clearly not the objective (nor is it proposed even among supportive states). Overly-restrictive measures threatening to prosecute patients, doctors, or others lawfully accessing the drug (at least under state law) is equally untenable. Making progress in a new era in the marijuana debates requires the crafting of responsible drug policies that properly balance consumers' interest in access and safe use with the public's health.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.duq.edu/faculty/wesley-oliver">Welsey M. Oliver</a> of <a href="https://www.law.duq.edu/">Duquesne University Law School</a>, burglary sentencing under the ACCA...

The federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/armed_career_criminal_act_%281984%29">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) provides, among other things, that felons who are found in possession of a weapon will receive enhanced punishment if the felon has previously been convicted of burglary, arson, or extortion.  The punishment for the offense of being a felon-in-possession is punishable by up to ten years’ incarceration, but if the defendant was previously convicted of one of the three identified offenses, the range of punishment is fifteen years to life.
	
The Supreme Court’s fall term will consider two cases that raise the question of what types of state burglary statute makes a defendant eligible for the enhancement under the Act. (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12961109527778857239&amp;q=860+F.3d+854&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">United States v. Stitt</span></a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12604970396951683279&amp;q=854+F.3d+1037&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">United States v. Sims</span></a>). Specifically, these cases raise the question of whether burglary statutes that include movable vehicles adapted for habitation are so far outside the commonly understood definition of burglary as not to trigger the enhanced penalties.

While paradigmatic examples of burglary, arson, and extortion are easily identified, state statutes offer a range of definitions of these crimes. The ACCA does not, however, provide which definitions of these crimes it expects sentencing courts to use to determine whether a state conviction qualifies for the enhancement.

The Supreme Court has therefore concluded that defendants who are convicted under state statutes criminalizing the “generic” versions of these crimes are eligible for the enhancement. By “generic,” the Court has explained it means the “commonly understood” elements of the crimes of burglary, arson, and extortion.

<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10076529272791248373&amp;q=Decamps+v.+US&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Descamps v. United States</span></a>, offers an easy example of a state statute that the Court concluded swept in conduct that is not part of the common understanding of burglary. The version of California’s burglary statute under which Descamps was previously convicted did not require the defendant’s entry into a building to be unlawful. Burglary at common law required that the defendant’s entry be unlicensed and removing this element of the crime dramatically increased the scope of the crime. As the Court observed in <span class="casename">Descamps</span>, this version of the crime transformed ordinary misdemeanor shoplifting into felonious burglary. 

Likewise, the Court has concluded that state burglary statutes that criminalize entry into vehicles or vending machines exceed the definition of “generic” burglary. One can therefore find statements in a number of Supreme Court opinions concluding that state convictions under statutes that define burglary as entry into vehicles do not subject a defendant to the greater penalties under the ACCA.

Two years ago, the Supreme Court considered a case that will provide the defendants in the present cases one of their best arguments. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1299128025372940695&amp;q=136+S.Ct.+2243&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Mathis v. United States</span></a>, the Court considered whether a defendant’s sentence could be enhanced under the ACCA if the specific facts of his prior crime would have amounted to a generic burglary. The Court concluded that the trial court that sentenced Mathis under the ACCA had improperly considered the indictment in his previous burglary cases to conclude that, under the facts of Mathis’ case, the prior conviction permitted the enhanced sentence. 

The Court in <span class="casename">Mathis</span> did not elaborate on the Iowa burglary statutes under which the defendant had previously been convicted, but as the Sixth Circuit noted in its en banc decision, the Iowa burglary statute there at issue was substantively identical to the one in <span class="casename">Stitt</span>. The issue before the Court in <span class="casename">Mathis</span> was an evidentiary one – on what basis could a sentencing court find the defendant had been convicted of a generic burglary. Certainly though the trial court concluded that the Iowa burglary statute did not qualify as a generic burglary, requiring further evidence for the Court to conclude that the ACCA was applicable. In other words, the Supreme Court has not directly decided whether a conviction under a statute defining burglary to include a vehicle used as a dwelling qualifies a defendant for an enhancement under the ACCA. The Supreme Court in 2016 did, however, consider a case in which the parties all assumed that a conviction under such a statute would not permit such an enhancement.

But the Supreme Court’s basic test for whether a prior conviction for burglary, arson, or extortion qualifies under the ACCA must be reconsidered. The Court asks whether a state’s statute under which the defendant was previously convicted defined these crimes as they are “commonly understood.”  The common law quite understandable made no mention of these issues – Winnebagos and doublewide trailers were unfamiliar to John Adams’ generation. The majority of the states, and the MPC, however, define burglary to include vehicles for overnight stays.

Perhaps more importantly, burglary statutes that include portable as well as stationary residences protect an individual’s security where he sleeps, an interest at the core of all burglary statutes. Differentiating burglaries of stationary and portable properties would further create different levels of protection based on means. Those who live in mobile homes seemingly desire would-be burglars to be deterred from entering their residences just as much as those who can afford to live in gated communities.

A formal approach – one that observes that burglary of vehicles occupied as dwellings expands the historic understanding of burglary – would lead the Court to conclude that burglary convictions obtained in most American states would not provide a basis for enhancing a defendant’s sentence under the ACCA. A functional approach – one that asks whether modern statutes protecting individuals sleeping in movable dwellings are analogous to the historic rationale for the long-existing crime of burglary – would give prosecutors many more opportunities to drastically elevate penalties for felons found in possession of weapons.

		<title>Justice Department is Monitoring Compliance with Federal Voting Rights Laws on Election Day</title>

<div class="node__content node__content">
<div class="field field--name-field-pr-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden">
<div class="field__items">
<div class="field__item even">

The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-monitor-compliance-federal-voting-rights-laws-election-day">announced</a> on Monday its plan for the upcoming Election Day. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt">Civil Rights Division</a> plans to monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws by deploying personnel to 35 jurisdictions across 19 states.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the efforts are aimed "to protect the rights of millions of Americans to cast their vote unimpeded at one of more than 170,000 precincts across America."

While State and local governments are primarily responsible for managing the election process, the Civil Rights Division has monitored many elections, since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The Press Release details that the focus of the Division is to:
<blockquote>gather information on, among other things, whether voters are subject to different voting qualifications or procedures on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group; whether jurisdictions are complying with the language minority provisions of the Voting Rights Act; whether jurisdictions permit a voter to receive assistance by a person of his or her choice if the voter has a disability or is unable to read or write; whether jurisdictions provide polling locations and voting systems allowing voters with disabilities to cast a private and independent ballot; whether jurisdictions comply with the voter registration list requirements of the National Voter Registration Act; and whether jurisdictions comply with the provisional ballot requirements of the Help America Vote Act.  Division personnel will also maintain contact with local election officials.</blockquote>
The Civil Rights Division has three sections devoted to investigating reports on Election Day.  The "Voting Section enforces the civil provisions of a wide range of federal statutes that protect the right to vote including the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/uocava">Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/subtitle-II/chapter-205">National Voter Registration Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/assets/1/6/HAVA41.PDF">Help America Vote Act</a>, and the Civil Rights Acts." Whereas, the "Division’s Disability Rights Section enforces the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> to ensure that persons with disabilities have a full and equal opportunity to vote," and the "Division’s Criminal Section enforces federal criminal statutes that prohibit voter intimidation and voter suppression based on race, color, national origin or religion."

On Election Day, the Civil Rights Division will have staff available to receive complaints from the public regarding possible violations of federal voting rights laws. Complaints can be reported at (1-800-253-3931 toll free, or 202-307-2767 or TTY 202-305-0082).  In addition, individuals may report complaints by fax to (202-307-3961), by <a href="mailto:voting.section@usdoj.gov">email</a>, and by a complaint form on the Department’s <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/votercomplaint">website</a>.

Allegations of election fraud are also investigated by the 94 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices across the country. Complaints may be directed to any <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao/find-your-united-states-attorney">local U.S. Attorneys’ Office</a> or to any <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us">local FBI office</a>.

The Justice Department urges anyone experiencing a disruption at a polling place to contact local election officials, but warns that any reports of violence, threats of violence or intimidation at a polling place should be immediately reported to local authorities by dialing 911, before reporting to the DOJ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) complied a report concerning information on Medicare telehealth and presented it to Congress on Thursday. The report indicated that federal laws regulating telehealth limit the accessibility of these services to Medicare beneficiaries, especially senior citizens.

The report comes as a response to directive issued by the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act. The Act, aims to <span>accelerate discovery, development, and delivery of new cures and treatments. Specifically, the Act</span> mandated that CMS compile a report detailing the number of Medicare enrollees that use telehealth services. Telehealth

In addition to identifying which Medicare beneficiaries use telehealth services, the report also addressed barriers to expanding the use and subsequent coverage for telehealth services. Research shows that telehealth has the potential to improve access to care to all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of their age, race, and geographic location. However, the report outlines certain federal statutory restrictions that inhibit the expanded use of telehealth.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Defending the Jury After Stanley</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist, <a href="http://creaseharman.com/dr-charles-i-m-lugosi-j-d/">Dr. Charles I. M. Lugosi, J.D. LL.M. M.B.E. S.J.D. </a> Counsel at the law firm of <a href="http://creaseharman.com/">Crease Harman, LLP</a>, discusses the jury controversy resulting from the trial of Gerald Stanley ...</p>

<p>Speaking in my personal capacity as a lawyer who acted both as a prosecutor and as defence counsel, I am appalled at the brazen irresponsible conduct of those in positions of power and authority who are apparently shamelessly exploiting the <a href="http://www.canadianlawyermag.com/legalfeeds/author/aidan-macnab/stanley-acquittal-should-not-lead-to-scrapping-peremptory-challenges-say-criminal-lawyers-15332/">verdict</a> in the <span class="casename">Stanley</span> case to possibly further political agendas. The trial process in every murder case is a carefully nuanced balance of accumulated wisdom developed over years of experience, and the fairness of the trial's judge's charge to the jury in <span class="casename">Stanley</span> is absolutely clear in the instructions given to the jury. The trial judge is the sole judge of the law; the jury is the sole judge of the facts, free from judicial intimidation since <span class="casename"><a href="http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-1335/1670-The-Jury-Earns-Its-Independence-Bushels-case.aspx">Bushel's Case</a></span> in 1670. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury is <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/#sec649">legally forbidden</a> to divulge what happens in their deliberations, and unlike American jurors, face serious consequences if confidentiality is violated.<br />
 <br />
Recent widespread <a href="http://www.news1130.com/2018/02/10/gerald-stanley-verdict-blow-reconciliation-terrifying-one/">public outrage</a> suggests that justice was not done because the racial composition of the jury did not contain a sufficient component of visibly indigenous people, and suggest that therefore the jury in Gerald Stanley's case was presumably racist and incapable of rendering a true verdict of guilt, because the victim was indigenous.  This assumes that the all-white jury of Mr. Stanley's peers was incapable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict upon the evidence, denying justice, and this mandates urgent legislative reform.  But this kind of thinking is unfair speculation at best. These kinds of statements irresponsibly flame speculation that the <u>Stanley</u> jury was racist and that the entire criminal justice system in Canada is tainted by systemic racism. Comments, such as to "do better" cross the line, putting pressure on juries to decide a verdict by adding race as a factor, when considering all the admissible evidence. Political interference with jurors who are impartial judges must be soundly rebuked.<br />
 <br />
The legally muzzled jury members are unable to publicly voice their outrage at the insinuation that they are racist, that they refused to convict Mr. Stanley because he was white and that the jurors were prejudiced against Colten Boushie because he was indigenous. Consider this. What if Mr. Stanley was tried for murder by a single judge that was an indigenous person? What if the judge found him guilty? Would there be an outcry by Mr. Stanley's supporters, that the indigenous judge was prejudiced because a white man was found guilty? Would public denunciation by politicians suggesting that this judge was racist against white people put those critics at risk for contempt of court, a criminal offence?<br />
 <br />
What is at stake here is respect for the rule of law, the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and independence of the judiciary.  There is no need to tinker or substantially make changes to a criminal trial process that is tested and true. Eliminating pre-emptory challenges is not the answer.<br />
 <br />
In <span class="casename">R. v. Black</span>, a young indigenous man, John Black, while pumping gas into his vehicle at a gas station in Kelowna, was confronted by an unarmed white man riding a bicycle, who was taunting and threatening him. Mr. Black, fearing for the safety of his wife and child in his car, calmly opened the trunk of his car, took out a tire iron, and struck a single blow to the head of the white man, shattering his skull and killing him. Mr. Black then drove to the police station and turned himself in. He was charged with second-degree murder. I was his defence lawyer. My indigenous client was judged by what appeared to be an all-white jury. My client was acquitted. The jury did their duty fairly and impartially. The judge correctly instructed the jury on the law. There was no appeal by the Crown. The members of the white victim's family were outraged at what they perceived was a grave injustice. Politicians and leaders in the indigenous community were silent in the wake of this case. There were no headlines suggesting racism when this 1994 white jury acquitted an indigenous man of killing a white man.<br />
 <br />
The point is that Canadians of every race need to reject cheap overtures from self-interested persons for reform when no reform is needed. The jury system works well.<br />
 <br />
On occasion, juries may ignore the instructions of judges and deliver a verdict that is perverse, contrary to the evidence. Jury nullification happens when the personal values of individual jurors reject what the prosecution is attempting to accomplish. The Supreme Court of Canada noted, in <span class="casename"><a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/288/index.do">R. v. Morgentaler</a></span>, that disclosing to jurors the existence of this legal right is not permitted, as public knowledge of this limitation on government power might lead to chaos and disturb the rule of law. This is particularly so in situations when racial prejudice is so strong that a juror might be unwilling to ever convict someone of the same race, or conversely, may vote to convict the accused because the victim is of the same race as the juror.<br />
 <br />
Playing the race card in the wake of the <span class="casename">Stanley</span> case does not lead to more justice but smacks of jury tampering by political intimidation, rendering an expectation that race is a factor in achieving a better or different verdict. This is a dangerous path that must be soundly rejected by people of principle and integrity. There are other ways to combat the evil of racism. This is not one of them.<br />
 <br />
William Penn's words to the <span class="casename">Bushel</span> court in 1670 are still relevant today, "My jury who are my judges, ought not to be menaced; that their verdict should be free, and not compelled... I do desire that justice may be done me, and that the arbitrary resolves of the bench may not be made the measure of my jury's verdict...." To which Justice Howel replied, "Stop that prating fellow's mouth, or put him out of court," and then ordered the jury to be deprived of food, drink, heat and toilet facilities until the desired verdict was reached, which the jury bravely refused to do. The jurors were imprisoned along with the acquitted Penn. Political intimidation is no less wrong than judicial intimidation in a free and democratic society governed by the rule of law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Moien Odeh of the Professionals in Humanitarian Assistance and Protection provides a critical analysis of recent Israeli legislative efforts to enlarge the city limits of Jerusalem ...</j:header></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In 2017, two bills were introduced from the Israeli government coalition's members - the Basic Law: Jerusalem, Capital of Israel (Amendment No. 2) Bill and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-settlement/u-s-pressure-delays-israels-greater-jerusalem-bill-legislator-idUSKBN1CY0CB">Greater Jerusalem Bill </a>- both designed to substantively change the borders of Jerusalem and to change its demographics.  Introduced during the 50th anniversary year of the 1967 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/israel-judaising-east-jerusalem-171206102051198.html">annexation</a> of East Jerusalem, their shared objective was the de facto annexation of the settlement blocs surrounding Jerusalem and the displacement of approximately 140 thousand (one third) of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem living in the neighborhoods already effectively detached from the city by the Separation Barrier. These proposals were not raised in a vacuum; they are part of a continuum of initiatives advanced in recent years, all of which aim to unilaterally force determinative territorial-political facts on Jerusalem in the guise of "municipal measures."  </p>

<p>Following the Israeli occupation of the Holy City in 1967, the Israeli authorities annexed approximately 70 square kilometers of West Bank land to the boundaries of the Jerusalem Municipality and imposed Israeli law on it. The annexed land did not include only the eastern city with its borders that were under Jordanian control, but also included an additional 64 kilometers that were located in the surrounding Palestinian villages and towns. Almost a third of the annexed territory was expropriated in order to build expansive Israeli neighborhoods/settlements along the annexation line. Additional areas were expropriated officially while others were declared national parks or green areas, effectively resulting in the expropriation of those areas as well.</p>

<p><strong>Jewish Big Majority in the City</strong><br />
 <br />
The main Israeli consideration was, and still is, to maintain an absolute demographic Jewish majority in Jerusalem. During the annexation, Israel refrained from including some densely populated Palestinian areas within its new borders of Jerusalem. Accordingly, several villages remained outside the municipal boundaries of the city, while some of their lands were annexed to these borders. The Palestinians living within the newly demarcated boundaries of East Jerusalem were given <a href="http://www.inss.org.il/publication/the-residency-status-of-east-jerusalems-palestinians/">permanent resident </a>status, with no guarantee of civil or political rights within the city to which they were annexed</p>

<p>Since 1967, Israel has acted to reinforce a clear Jewish majority in Jerusalem through incentives and massive building for Israelis while simultaneously imposing legal and bureaucratic restrictions on Palestinian building and permanent residency status. In spite of Israeli policy making in Jerusalem, the Jewish majority in the city has steadily decreased over the years. The original Israeli aspiration for a majority of 70% Jews: 30% Palestinians <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-demographics/population-parity-in-historic-palestine-raises-hard-questions-for-israel-idUSKCN0RA1VR20150910">has been eclipsed</a> by a current forecast of 60% to 40% (now 37% Arab Palestinians). </p>

<p>The unilateral legal measures that Israel undertook in East Jerusalem did not change the legal status of East Jerusalem under international law. Until recently, no nation, including the United States, <a href="/paperchase/2017/12/un-general-assembly-demands-compliance-with-jerusalem-related-security-council-decisions.php">has recognized</a> the annexation of East Jerusalem to Israel (de facto or de jure) or Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem. In spite of this position, Israel has treated Jerusalem as a total Israeli land. </p>

<p>The Israeli authorities used different tools as part of the demographic battle; the first was building part of the separation wall inside the municipal borders of the city and pushing people into the neighborhoods behind the wall. (After building the wall, the Israeli authorities allowed huge and unsafe buildings to go up in the neighborhoods beyond the wall, and continued its very restricted building polices in the neighborhoods inside the wall). The others were the bills and draft laws to change the municipal borders of the city.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Law: Jerusalem, 1980</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic10_eng.htm">Basic Law: Jerusalem</a>, declares that United Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It was passed July 30, 1980. The law came against the backdrop of the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/camp-david-accords-signed">peace accords</a> with Egypt.</p>

<p>According to UN General Assembly <a href="https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/7F0AF2BD897689B785256C330061D253">Resolution 181</a> of 1947, JJerusalem was to be an internationalized area under UN supervision, with the partition of the rest of the Palestine Mandate into Jewish and Arab states. However, the Arabs and the Jews both objected to internationalization, and the UN never tried to implement its international regime. It did continue to treat Jerusalem as though it was a <a href="http://time.com/4604739/david-friedman-jerusalem-jewish-israel/">"Corpus Separatum"</a>.</p>

<p>Jerusalem Basic law: Jerusalem evoked a storm of protest from the international community, resulting in UN Security Council Resolutions <a href="https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/6DE6DA8A650B4C3B852560DF00663826">476</a> and <a href="https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/DDE590C6FF232007852560DF0065FDDB">478</a> later in 1980. These declared that the status of East Jerusalem was no different from that of the rest of the West Bank, that it was "occupied" territory, and that all attempts by Israel to change the status of the city are illegal and will be ignored by international law. In consequence of these resolutions, most foreign countries removed their embassies from Jerusalem. At this time, Israel built several neighborhoods on the periphery of Jerusalem, at the border of the enlarged municipality, in order to emphasize its determination that Jerusalem must remain united under its control.</p>

<p><strong>Greater Jerusalem Bill</strong></p>

<p>Greater Jerusalem Bill is not new; in the 90s, Israeli started working on the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-transformation-of-jerusalem_us_59d7d99ce4b0cf2548b336e2">"greater Jerusalem" Plan</a>. It meant to artificially create a Jewish majority in Jerusalem by further enlarging the borders of the city to include three big blocks of settlements to it: Givat Ze'ev to the north, Ma'aleh Adumim to the east and Gush Etzion to the south. At the same time, Israeli policy makers tightened restrictions on the Palestinian population in Jerusalem </p>

<p>The idea of expanding Jerusalem's municipal borders "to increase the city's population and to ensure its Jewish majority" was proposed in 2007. It was deferred then, due to the fear of a strong international reaction. The idea did not die. It morphed into a movement and politicians from all ideological backgrounds joined in, fearing that, in the future, Israel will lose the 'demographic war' in Jerusalem, as well as in the rest of historic Palestine.</p>

<p>The new great Jerusalem bill that was suggested in July 2016 suggesting to include five settlements blocks (Ma'aleh Adumim, Gush Etzion, Efrat, Beitar Illit and Givat Ze'ev) with about 150 thousands settlers to be included under Jerusalem's municipal jurisdiction, but not officially annexed to Israel.  The proposed bill was submitted by MK Yoav Kish (Likud) with the support of Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz (Likud), who also holds the Intelligence Affairs portfolio. According to the minister Katz, the motivation behind the bill is to "weaken the Arab hold on the capital." "The Greater Jerusalem Bill is an extremely important bill," KM Kish said, adding that it "enshrines Jerusalem's status as the eternal capital of the people of Israel and the Jewish majority in the capital." </p>

<p><a href="http://www.savejewishjerusalem.org.il/en/">"Save Jewish Jerusalem"</a> was launched in 2016 and quickly enlisted the support of politicians, academicians and other well-regarded Israelis, all united by their fear that they "would wake up with a Palestinian mayor in Jerusalem." So, when the 'Greater Jerusalem law' was introduced earlier this year, it seemed like the logical evolution of a current that has been on the rise for years.</p>

<p>Only hours before discussing the draft bill with ministerial committee of legislation affairs in October 2017, the bill <a href="https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2017/11/09/creeping-annexation-why-israel-shelved-the-greater-jerusalem-law/">was stricken</a> from the committee's agenda as a result of international pressure (mainly American). Sources in the Israeli PM's office noted that "diplomatic preparation and has therefore been rejected for the moment." Now, and with Trump's Administration and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/05/politics/us-embassy-jerusalem-donald-trump/index.html">the announcement</a> of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel with the recent news about moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem in May 2018 to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary.</p>

<p>The Israeli PM and his coalition is busy now with corruption charges and cases, but this does not mean that the government will reduce its efforts to create facts on the ground in Jerusalem and to change its borders hoping to change the demographic picture in the holy city.    </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. Charles Lugosi of Crease Harman, LLP, discusses how Canadian prime ministers' evasive answers during the Question Period expose deeper constitutional issues...</p>

                <p>All Canadian citizens, regardless of personal political preferences, are the heartbeat of parliamentary democracy. Together we vote to choose the political party that will exercise the powers of the executive branch of the federal government.  A caring electorate can only make an informed vote when the people know about the mistakes the Prime Minister has made, that are exposed by the Opposition during <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/Compendium/Questions/c_d_questionperiod-e.htm">Question Period </a>in the House of Commons. Public accountability is achieved by truthful responsive answers communicated by journalists and is fundamental to achieving a check and balance between the power of the executive and the legislative branches of government to prevent executive corruption and contempt of Parliament, and ultimately contempt of the people of Canada. </p>

                <p>Giving direct, frank, candid answers that are responsive meets the government&#8217;s constitutional duty. Public denunciation of the platitudes and political rhetoric uttered as nonsensical answers to legitimate questions has failed to reverse the threat to democracy from Prime Ministers Harper and Justin Trudeau, who have refused to engage in meaningful dialogue.  The result is that important role of Question Period has been trivialized and <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/sps/qpr/sites/webpublish.queensu.ca.qprwww/files/files/13%20question%20of%20accountability%20question%20period.pdf">rendered powerless</a> [PDF], reduced to a disgraceful display of arrogance, incivility, and absurdity.  The legitimacy of Parliament is at stake, as Speakers of the House, such as Mr. Scheer and Mr. Regan, have claimed that the lack of specific rules makes them helpless and so have failed to resolve this constitutional crisis contributed to by both the Conservative and Liberal parties. It is pathetic to excuse this lack of leadership by Speakers and say, &#8220;That is why it is called question period, not answer period.&#8221; Canada deserves national and international ridicule for the constant display of buffoonery during Question Period.</p>

                <p>Fortunately Canada is also a constitutional monarchy, which means that Governor General Julie Payette has the constitutional and legal authority as Canada&#8217;s Head of State, and as Commander-in -Chief, to restore balance, ethics and integrity to the government, by asking these simple questions of the Supreme Court of Canada, &#8220;Is it unconstitutional and contempt of Parliament anytime the Prime Minister or any Minister of the Crown, or a delegate, gives an unresponsive answer to a question in Question Period?&#8221; &#8220;If yes, may the Governor General, then dissolve Parliament and call a general election?&#8221; Sections 53(2) and (3) of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-26/index.html">Supreme Court Act</a> permits the Governor in Council to refer to the Supreme Court an important question of law or fact for an advisory opinion.  Normally the Governor General will act upon the advice of the Privy Council, which is comprised of the cabinet members of the ruling party. It is reasonable to expect that the Prime Minister would order the cabinet to oppose the proposed reference, since the root of the current problem lies with Prime Minister Trudeau. There may be different legal opinions whether the Governor General may act unilaterally contrary to the advice of the Privy Council and submit the Reference on her own motion. I think she can, since the entire Privy Council would need to abstain from the reference issue because of an inherent conflict of interest.</p>

                <p>It may be that the Liberal party will come to its senses. After all, the Liberals under Justin Trudeau made a <a href="https://www.liberal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-plan-for-a-strong-middle-class.pdf">campaign promise</a> [PDF] to reform the disgraceful abuses of Question Period by Conservatives like Stephen Harper&#8217;s parliamentary secretary, Paul Calandra. Trudeau promised: &#8220;&#8230;the Prime Minister represents all Canadians and should be directly accountable to all Canadians.&#8221; But Trudeau has failed to keep his promise. </p>

                <p>A glaring illustration is his <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-question-period-ethics-commissioner-1.4108903">repeated refusal</a> on May 10, 2017 during Question Period to answer a simple question about how many times he met with the Ethics Commissioner. Instead of demonstrating accountability, Trudeau feebly clung to &#8220;consistency&#8221;, weakly claiming, &#8220;That is what Canadians expect.&#8221; Last week, outside the House, Trudeau <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/03/02/justin-trudeau-calls-donald-trumps-plans-for-huge-steel-aluminum-tariffs-unacceptable_a_23375463/">was asked</a> by a journalist about President Trump&#8217;s decision to put trade barriers on the imports of Canadian steel and aluminium. Trudeau fumbled an incoherent answer that has been mocked on social media as a national embarrassment for Canadians who wanted to hear a sophisticated thoughtful response. Perhaps that is why he avoids answering questions during Question Period because he is incapable of spontaneous responsive answers and can only deliver a scripted evasive answer extolling the virtues of the Liberal agenda. </p>

                <p>It is impossible for Canadians to have confidence in a government that undermines democracy and the rule of law by repeatedly rejecting questions designed to hold the executive branch accountable to Parliament and the people of Canada. I agree with <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/11/17/michael-ignatieff-intellectual-who-wanted-politician/c5XKjVRISmnmX3NFHpJjAK/story.html">Michael Ignatieff </a>that, &#8220;there can be no more profound cause for an election than the protection of democracy.&#8221; That is why the Governor General needs to obtain a responsive answer from the Supreme Court of Canada whether her office may dissolve Parliament if the Government refuses to submit to accountability during Question Period. In my opinion, this is what Canadians expect.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cooley.edu/faculty/lauren-rousseau">Lauren A. Rousseau</a> of the <a href="https://www.cooley.edu/">Western Michigan University Cooley Law School</a> discusses the impact that the onslaught of litigation against the pharmaceutical industry could have on the opioid epidemic...</p><strong>A</strong>ccording to the federal Centers for Disease Control, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db294.htm">over 63,600 people</a> died of drug overdose in the United States in 2016 - an average of 174 deaths per day. This was a 21% increase compared to 2015, and more than three times the number of such deaths in 1999. The annual number of overdose deaths has been steadily rising over the last fifteen years, leading many to refer to our current drug problem as an epidemic. And this epidemic has been driven largely by addiction to opioid drugs. In 2016, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html">more than 42,000 overdose deaths</a>, or 72%, were related to opioids, which includes prescription painkillers such as Vicodin, Lortab, Percocet, and OxyContin, as well as illicit drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. In October 2017, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html">President Trump formally declared</a> our country's drug problem a public health emergency.</p>

<p>Much media attention has been given to the role pharmaceutical companies have played in creating the opioid epidemic. In the mid-1990s, the medical community's conclusion that pain was undertreated converged with Purdue Pharma's introduction of its new, extended-release opioid drug OxyContin, setting the stage for a sea change in how opioids were used and prescribed. Prior to this, opioids had been viewed as dangerously addictive and were prescribed only under limited circumstances, but Purdue claimed that OxyContin was virtually non-addictive when prescribed for pain and aggressively marketed it for long-term use.  Its marketing strategy was wildly successful; <a href="http://fortune.com/2011/11/09/oxycontin-purdue-pharmas-painful-medicine/">sales of OxyContin exploded</a> from $45 million in 1996 to $3 billion in 2012. Other opioid drug manufacturers jumped on the bandwagon, with the result that opioid prescriptions in this country <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html">nearly quadrupled</a> from 1999 to 2010. By 2012, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid-prescribing/index.html">more than 259 million opioid prescriptions were written</a> - enough for every American adult to have his or her own bottle of pills.</p>

<p>We are all now painfully aware that opioid drugs are extremely addictive. Opioid overdose <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/opioid-prescribing/infographic.html">deaths have risen in tandem</a> with the increase in opioid prescriptions. Prescription pills also served as a gateway to heroin use. Heroin is a stronger and cheaper opioid, and once a person becomes addicted to prescription pills, cost and difficulty obtaining pills often drive the person to heroin. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine,<a href="https://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf"> four out of five</a> heroin users start with prescription pills.</p>

<p>The drug epidemic has been extremely costly to our country, in terms of both human life and dollars. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6450a3.htm">Over 500,000 people</a> have lost their lives since 2000 due to drug overdose, and it is estimated that <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/27/opioid-deaths-forecast/">another 500,000 will die</a> from this cause by 2027. The cost to our society, in terms of lost wages, productivity, and tax revenue, as well as increased spending on health care, social services, education, and criminal justice, is estimated to have <a href="https://altarum.org/about/news-and-events/economic-toll-of-opioid-crisis-in-u-s-exceeded-1-trillion-since-2001">exceeded $1 trillion</a> from 2001 to 2017. Increasingly, state and local governments are looking to the pharmaceutical industry to cover these costs.</p>

<p>Purdue Pharma has been repeatedly sued based on its misrepresentations concerning the addictive nature of its opioid drugs. The company <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/JONES/107CR00029.PDF">pled guilty in 2007</a> to criminal charges of misbranding OxyContin with the intent to defraud and mislead the public, and paid $635 million in fees and fines. Other drug companies have also paid millions of dollars in civil penalties and fines in connection with their opioid drugs. </p>

<p>In September 2017, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/19/552135830/41-states-to-investigate-pharmaceutical-companies-over-opioids">attorneys general of 41 states announced</a> that they were banding together to investigate opioid manufacturers and distributors to determine their role in creating the opioid epidemic.  And in the past year and a half, hundreds of lawsuits have been filed by cities, counties, and states in both state and federal courts against opioid drug manufacturers and distributors, alleging misleading marketing and failure to monitor, detect, investigate, and report suspicious orders of opioid drugs.   </p>

<p>In December 2017, 64 opioid lawsuits filed in federal courts in Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Washington, and West Virginia were consolidated by the federal Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/MDL-2804-Initial-Transfer-11-17.pdf">transferred to the Northern District of Ohio</a> under Judge Dan Polster. Since then, the litigation has grown to include <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-us--opioid-crisis-lawsuits-20180130-story.html">more than 250 lawsuits</a>, and is known as the National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL #2804.  Ohio was chosen as the venue because it has the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db294.pdf">second highest overdose death rate</a> in the nation (second only to West Virginia), is geographically central and accessible to the parties, and is home to one of the largest wholesale drug distributors. </p>

<p>The opioid litigation has been compared to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021365/">tobacco litigation of the 1990s</a>, which resulted in the largest civil settlement in our nation's history. In those cases, 46 state attorneys general claimed that the tobacco companies were liable for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. The settlement exceeded $200 billion, with the companies agreeing to make annual payments to the states to fund smoking prevention campaigns and other health programs. Unfortunately, much of that settlement money has been diverted by the states for purposes unrelated to smoking.</p>

<p>The opioid litigation plaintiffs face challenges that the tobacco plaintiffs did not. In the tobacco cases, smokers weren't misusing the products, but got sick anyway; with opioids, users who develop addiction inevitably take more of the drug than is prescribed, and often engage in criminal behavior such as doctor-shopping, forging prescriptions, or stealing pills. These behaviors make it harder to hold pharmaceutical companies liable for the consequences of opioid use. Historically, courts have laid blame for drug misuse on the individual user, not on pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, in the tobacco cases, the companies were marketing directly to consumers, making it easier to link tobacco use to the companies' actions; with opioids, pharmaceutical companies directed their marketing campaigns at doctors, who then prescribed the drugs to their patients. The companies can point to doctors as an intervening cause, alleging that they overprescribed and should have recognized signs of addiction in their patients. </p>

<p>Despite the challenges, it is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is facing significant potential liability. Judge Polster has indicated that he would like to see these cases resolved through settlement before trial. In February, he invited representatives of all the parties to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-us--opioid-crisis-lawsuits-20180130-story.html">begin settlement discussions</a>, and included representatives of state court opioid lawsuits, the state attorneys general who banded together to investigate the industry, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and insurance companies. By all appearances, Judge Polster is working to craft a global resolution designed to turn the tide on the opioid crisis.   </p>

<p>However the lawsuits are resolved, they will surely have a positive impact on health policy and community attitudes towards addiction. The hundreds of filings publicly demonstrate the pervasiveness of the disease, showing that it hits all communities, all socioeconomic classes, and all ages and ethnicities. This helps to reduce the stigma associated with addiction that so often is a barrier to treatment and recovery.  The lawsuits have shown a spotlight on the deceptive marketing practices of the pharmaceutical industry, to the benefit of both doctors and patients, many of whom will now take more care in how they deal with medications. The lawsuits also provide support for government regulation that is clearly needed to curb excessive prescribing by doctors, misleading marketing behaviors of pharmaceutical companies, and irresponsible drug distribution. In a possible harbinger of things to come, Purdue Pharma announced on February 10th that it will <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/10/health-care/uncertain-hour/oxycontin-maker-purdue-pharma-stop-marketing-opioids-doctors">voluntarily stop marketing</a> its opioid drugs to doctors. </p>

<p>A large monetary settlement of these cases could make a significant difference in reversing the upward trend in overdose deaths and addiction. There is a serious shortage of treatment beds, facilities, and trained personnel to treat addiction, and funding could alleviate these problems. Money is also needed for prevention efforts in schools, education and awareness campaigns, health care reimbursement costs, addiction treatment in the jails, first responder training, and supplies of the overdose reversal drug naloxone. Taking a lesson from the failures of the tobacco settlement, any opioid litigation settlement should include provisions to ensure that states are using the money for its intended purpose, and not diverting it to other uses.</p>

<p>Concern has been raised by some that the pendulum may swing too far, and that patients with legitimate pain may be denied needed medication. This is a legitimate issue. However, scientific studies have demonstrated that long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain is not as effective as once thought, and that non-opioid pain relievers can provide comparable relief. Furthermore, the liability and addiction issues surrounding opioid drugs are spurring research into alternative pain therapies that are safer and equally effective.   </p>

<p>In conclusion, the avalanche of lawsuits filed by cities, counties, and states against the pharmaceutical industry holds promise as a significant step forward in combatting the opioid epidemic. Lives literally hang in the balance as Judge Polster works with the parties to craft a settlement that could finally turn the tide on this scourge that is devastating our nation.   </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://johnbuckleton.wordpress.com/">John Buckleton</a> of New Zealand's <a href="http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/science-innovation/research-organisations/crown-research-institutes/esr">Institute of Environmental Science and Research</a>, discusses the future of DNA software in the courtroom...</p>

                <p>As anyone who has ever watched <em>CSI</em> can tell you, DNA is well established as the gold standard when it comes to crime solving. Linking the tiniest shreds of DNA evidence together, forensic investigators are able to provide indisputable proof that ties bad guys to the crime or frees the good guys who were in the wrong place at the wrong time&#8212all within an hour so that the CSI team can get ready for next week&#8217;s episode.</p>

                <p>If only real life was that easy. While there&#8217;s no denying the importance of DNA in successfully identifying criminals or clearing suspects, the actual process of gathering and deciphering DNA evidence is considerably more complicated. Poor-quality samples or partial profiles containing degraded DNA can present huge challenges in reconstructing a crime scene and identifying who was (and wasn&#8217;t) there. So too can complex DNA mixtures containing genetic data from more than two individuals, especially if any of the individuals are related.  </p>

                <p>Beyond the issues inherent in trying to decipher and interpret challenging DNA samples, you have to consider the human factor. Mislabeling DNA samples, misinterpreting test results, or accidentally transferring cellular material or DNA from one sample to another can all lead to false reports of a DNA match. </p>

                <p>The bottom line is that while forensic DNA testing is overwhelmingly reliable, it has occasional shortcomings. Like any process that involves human interaction and some degree of subjective decision-making, DNA tests are not now&#8212nor have they ever been&#8212completely error-free. </p>

                <p>So where does that leave us when it comes to the relatively recent introduction of sophisticated forensic DNA software that employs sophisticated biological modeling and algorithms to interpret DNA profiles?<br />
                    <br />
                    Forensic DNA software has greatly improved the ability to interpret low-level, degraded, or mixed DNA samples with a significantly higher degree of speed and accuracy than previously possible. Data from DNA testing can now be uploaded and run through an array of probability models, using more information from a DNA profile. The results can then be compared against a person or persons of interest and a likelihood ratio can be calculated, weighed against coincidence. This is ultimately used to resolve highly complex DNA mixtures previously considered too complex to interpret with a high degree of confidence in its validity. </p>

                <p>Not surprisingly, some attorneys are voicing concerns that DNA software is simply too new to be able to rely on the results it produces. Pointing to the <a href="https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ADMISSIBILITY-OF-EXPERT-TESTIMONY-CHART.pdf">Daubert or Frye-Mack Standards</a>, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike have charged that forensic software fails to meets the general acceptance test. They also raise questions about whether it has been validated independently and subject to peer review.</p>

                <p>To date, the courts generally have rejected such claims. Two 2017 Michigan cases (<span class="casename"><a href="https://strmix.esr.cri.nz/assets/Uploads/Daubert-Order-Burns.pdf">Michigan v.  Burns</a></span> and <span class="casename"><a href="https://johnbuckleton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/smith-daubert-ruling.pdf">Michigan v. Smith</a></span>) ruled that one such sophisticated forensic DNA software, STRmix™, satisfies all Daubert considerations&#8212i.e., it has been subjected to rigorous testing, validated subject to peer review, and is generally accepted in the scientific community, as well as federal and state courts. </p>

                <p>Similarly, the court ruled in <span class="casename"><a href="https://johnbuckleton.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/atty-admin6-sharpmx753n-donotreplyco-anoka-mn-us_20171115_161036.pdf">Minnesota v. Edwards</a></span> that the same software is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and, therefore, admissible in Minnesota courtrooms, while a U.S. District Court judge in New Mexico determined, in <a href="https://johnbuckleton.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/melvin-russell.pdf">U.S. v. Russell</a>, that STRmix™ &#8220;has been tested for the purpose relevant here, that such tests have been peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals, and that its analyses are based on calculations recognized as reliable in the field.&#8221;             </p>

                <p>Those calculations use probability models and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-zero-math-introduction-to-markov-chain-monte-carlo-methods-dcba889e0c50">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> (MCMC) methods employed since World War II, and currently used in everything from computational biology and weather prediction to physics, engineering, and the stock market. </p>

                <p>Similarly, as the court decisions note, numerous scientific papers about sophisticated DNA software have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In addition, internal validations have been carried out by all labs in current casework, as required by their accreditation, while both the <a href="https://www.isfg.org/">International Society for Forensic Genetics</a> and the <a href="https://www.swgdam.org/">Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods</a> (SWGDAM) have <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/4344b0_22776006b67c4a32a5ffc04fe3b56515.pdf">produced</a> guidelines for validating probabilistic genotyping software. </p>

                <p>Another charge leveled by some attorneys revolves around the refusal of some developers to reveal the source code and algorithms used in their software. Attorneys contend that it is impossible to review and challenge the solutions provided by forensic DNA software when there is no explanation or understanding of how the software functions.</p>

                <p>To a large extent, the courts have been divided on this issue. In <span class="casename">People v. Chubbs</span>, a cold murder case in California dating from the 1970s, the trial court determined that Chubbs was entitled to examine the source code under protective order. That decision was <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2768743/people-v-chubbs-ca24/">overturned</a> on appeal in 2015, however, with the court ruling that Chubbs&#8217; stated reasons to access the source code, even under protective order, did not outweigh trade secret protections.</p>

                <p>Similarly, the court in <span class="casename">Washington v. Fair</span>, a Seattle homicide case, <a href="https://www.cybgen.com/information/newsroom/2017/jan/FAIR-SOURCE.PDF">ruled</a> in January 2017 that it was &#8220;not persuaded that a review of the source code is necessary to determine whether TrueAllele [the forensic DNA software used in the case] is reliable &#8230; Testimony in this case from both state and defense experts establishes that scientists can confirm the reliability of TrueAllele without access to the source code.&#8221;</p>

                <p>In New York, however, a federal judge <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/federal_judge_releases_dna_software_source_code">unsealed</a> the source code for the same software program in <span class="casename">U.S. v. Johnson</span> after the investigative journalism organization ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-seeks-source-code-for-new-york-city-disputed-dna-software">filed</a> a motion arguing that there was a public interest in the code.  </p>

                <p>While there remains no consensus among the courts, some software developers now disclose their code under non-disclosure agreements. Other DNA software is open source, making its code and algorithms readily available for other users to explore and alter. In either instance, however, reputable developers suggest users take part in an extensive user training to ensure that they not only understand how the software works, but also how to correctly represent the results it generates in court. </p>

                <p>Almost certainly, these and other legal questions will continue to be raised about forensic DNA software. It&#8217;s the nature of anything new that is introduced into the courts. The bottom line, though, is that sophisticated forensic DNA software represents a tremendous breakthrough which, when properly used, can identify criminal activity and be presented in court proceedings with a high degree of confidence in the validity of its findings.</p>

                <p><em>John Buckleton is a noted forensic scientist who has worked extensively in the DNA field as a member of New Zealand&#8217;s Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR). Dr. Buckleton is one of the developers of STRmix™, a sophisticated forensic software used to resolve mixed DNA profiles previously considered too complex to interpret.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JUIRST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu/law/faculty/fulltime/BDavis.html">Benjamin G. Davis</a> of the <a href="http://www.utoledo.edu">University of Toledo College of Law</a> discusses the potential implications of Gina Haspel as CIA Director Designate....</p><strong>I.</strong> Ah, if the Obama Administration had only followed my advice!</p>

<p>November 15, 2016, after teaching class in Toledo, I had driven overnight from Toledo with a student, Victor Aberdeen, and arrived just in time to change from my road clothes and walk into the session entitled "Panel V - Continuity, Change and Future Challenges in the Use of Force Abroad of the 26th Annual Review of the Field of Law and National Security conference of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security." <br />
 <br />
Moderated by <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/donohue-laura.cfm">Laura Donohue</a>, Professor of Law, Director, Center on National Security and the Law at Georgetown Law, the panel included such stars of the national security firmament as <a href="https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/people/b/bellinger-john-b">John Bellinger</a>, Partner, National Security and Public International Law Practice at Arnold & Porter (formerly of the Bush National Security Council and Legal Adviser at Bush State), <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/derosa-mary-b.cfm">Mary DeRosa</a>, Distinguished Visitor from Practice, Co-Director, Global Law Scholars Program, Georgetown Law, <a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014Re4cAAC/christine-fair">Christine Fair</a>, Associate Professor, Security Studies Program, Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University,<a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lederman-martin-s.cfm"> Martin S. Lederman</a>, Associate Professor of Law, Georgetown Law (formerly of the Obama Office of Legal Counsel at Justice), and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/charlie-savage">Charlie Savage</a>, Washington Correspondent for The New York Times.</p>

<p>As they turned to the Q and A, I shot up my hand to ask the question I had held in my head since leaving Toledo. When Laura called on me, I asked whether during the interregnum between the election and the inauguration the Obama Administration might formally apologize on behalf of the United States to the world for the 44 country torture regime that the United States had put in place, and that John Bellinger (while at the Bush White House) had helped organize, and about which Marty Lederman (while at the Obama Office of Legal Counsel) had not been willing to prosecute. Apology is a remedy in international law, and by making such a formal apology the United States would have provided an enormous remedy to the world on behalf of itself and the 43 other countries that had helped the United States put in place the torture regime after 9/11. In addition, for any future Administration, they would be faced with denouncing our own unilateral given remedy of apology in international law - not impossible but a modest constraint on future torturers.</p>

<p>When I was challenged by John Bellinger on my facts about him, I replied that he should read John Rizzo's (former Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency) book <em>Company Man</em>, where he describes his role on page 189.</p>

<p>That apology never happened. Gina Haspel got appointed Deputy Director of the CIA in February, 2017 soon after the change of Administration, and this week we are confronted with her nomination to be the CIA Director.</p>

<p>II. Who is Gina Haspel?</p>

<p>Google or Bing her - the list of <a href="http://www.columbian.com/news/2018/mar/14/trumps-pick-for-cia-tied-to-torture-lawsuit-involving-spokane-psychologists/">articles</a> about her role at the Thai black site where Abu Zubaydah and Al-Nashiri were tortured by those mischievous psychologists James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/13/17113874/gina-haspel-torture-cia-pompeo-tillerson">long</a> (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pompeo-opposition/senator-paul-opposes-pompeo-haspel-nominations-idUSKCN1GQ292">See</a> also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/13/who-is-gina-haspel-trump-cia-director-torture-site-link">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/03/13/gina-haspel-nominated-to-be-cia-director-sciutto-nr.cnn">here</a>). Her role in destroying the 92 videotapes of those torture sessions will rivet you (the October 5, 2011 <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/10/cianocontempt.pdf">Opinion and Order Denying Motion to Hold Defendant Central Intelligence Agency in Civil Contempt</a> of Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein takes one through that sordid story). She is a bona fide knuckledragger (slang for torturer), who has managed to still survive and prosper going up the chain of command at the CIA.</p>

<p>III. Ain't it Grand?</p>

<p>With one fell stroke with her nomination, whether consciously or not, President Trump has done something that I want to draw to your attention. Yes, he has revived the discussions about torture, but much more importantly, he has done something else. He has called out the actors in the torture in and out of government to remind us of who they were in that post 9/11 period. Many of them have been very critical of him with respect to the Russia investigation and other Trump misadventures. And it has been remarkable to watch them.</p>

<p>For example, this morning Phillip Mudd (who was in the middle of it), the CNN commentator, did the full throated "it was authorized and we were legal" defense.</p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JABhSrMESu4">on CNN</a> (at 3:55) the full throated support of Haspel by James Clapper, Obama Director of National intelligence, up until the issue of torture comes up where one hears him saying that on the human rights issues, "she will have to deal with it."</p>

<p>Jose Rodriguez, in <em>Company Man</em> at several pages, is quoted as saying the destruction was to protect the CIA persons. Former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morrell (a CIA lifer) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/questions-of-torture-linger-over-cia-director-pick-gina-haspels-past/">sings her praises</a> and on torture presents on her behalf the infamous "just following orders" defense.</p>

<p>And of course Obama era CIA Director Leon Panetta has stepped in to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-pompeo-opposition/senator-paul-opposes-pompeo-haspel-nominations-idUSKCN1GQ292">support her</a>, and John Rizzo has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593398937/former-cia-lawyer-defends-gina-haspels-role-at-agency">chimed in</a> (as he did in his book <em>Company Man</em> with his version of it was proper: "Well, I mean, David, I was in the middle of all that at the time as the chief legal adviser for CIA. First of all, I do not believe that the word torture is what was and is actually legally accurate. They were very harsh, very brutal measures, but not torture.").</p>

<p>Lurking in the background are the dozens if not hundreds of civilians who were the leaders of and the cogs in the machine to make sure the 44 country torture regime was a well-oiled monster that was hidden from the light of day and, once Abu Ghraib occurred, accountability for design and implementation resisted. If you wonder who they were, just read Rizzo's book, the December 3, 2014 declassified summary of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/press/findings-and-conclusions.pdf">report</a>  entitled Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program,  and/or the Senate Armed Service Committee's November 20, 2008 <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Detainee-Report-Final_April-22-2009.pdf">report</a> entitled Inquiry into the Detainees Treatment in U.S. Custody. The names of all the protagonists (in and out of the Executive and the Legislative branches, and during both the Bush and Obama years) who years later are having a relook at their role in the torture and their obstruction of accountability can be found there. I wonder if Trump was targeting Mueller (head of the FBI at the relevant times) with this choice. All of these types suffered little or no consequences for their role in the torture and even got career improvements, as we can see with Gina Haspel.</p>

<p>IV. Who is left out of this blossoming discussion?<br />
  <br />
It would be nice, if just once, people would remember that there are four groups of people who have paid a price for the torture. The first one are those lowly soldiers at Abu Ghraib who were court-martialed and/or received administrative discipline for their role in torturing people there. Betraying the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2010-title10/USCODE-2010-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap47/content-detail.html">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> by doing the bidding of those who were not subject to its strictures. Played for chumps. Whenever persons say we do not prosecute people for torture, I remind them that we actually do prosecute people for torture - those soldiers who were at least as close to the torture as Gina Haspel. They got court-martialed, she got a promotion. Haspel got the elevator, Lynddie England <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/03/eight-years-after-abu-ghraib-lynndie-englands-not-doing-so-well/330398/">got the shaft</a>, or at least carried the water for her higher-ups.</p>

<p>The second group are the detainees held at Gitmo (Abu Zubaydah is still alive and has still not seen the light of day; Al-Nashiri is in an interminable military commission - both tortured at Gina Haspel's Thai country club), released, and dead.  A 2014 <a href="http://hrp.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CAT-Shadow-Report-Advocates-for-US-Torture-Prosecutions.pdf">shadow report</a> prepared by the Advocates for U.S. Torture Prosecutions for the UN Committee Against Torture   found that no detainee had as of 2014 received relief in the American justice system for their torture. Since then the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/17/544183178/psychologists-behind-cia-enhanced-interrogation-program-settle-detainees-lawsuit">settlement</a> of the case against James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen remains the true exception that proves the rule. Any relief has been abroad.</p>

<p>The third group are those around the world being tortured even as they speak knowing that there is no consequence in terms of world community opprobrium led by the United States. Once the United States was willing to go easy on torture, the knuckledraggers everywhere were let loose.</p>

<p>The fourth group are rainbow coalition of Americans who have rationalized the torture all these years and acquiesced in it. Talk about losing one's soul.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., of the University of California Davis School of Law  (UC Davis School of Law) discusses how a recent Supreme Court decision on whistleblower laws ultimately undermines the corporations they are meant to protect...</p>

<p>In<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1276_b0nd.pdf"> <u>Digital Realty Trust Inc. v. Somers</u></a> [PDF], the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2018/02/supreme-court-holds-anti-retaliation-protection-only-applies-to-reported-violations-before-terminati.php">voted 9-0</a> to narrow the definition of "whistleblower" under the <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm">Dodd-Frank Act of 2010</a>. In particular, the Court ruled that whistleblowers are only protected against retaliation from employers under Dodd-Frank if they report allegations of an employer's securities law violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission). Alternatively, whistleblowers who report alleged violations through an employer's internal compliance program without also reporting to the SEC, like Mr. Somers, cannot avail themselves of Dodd-Frank's protections against retaliation. </p>

<p>To date, commentary on the Court's decision has focused on (i) how it will reduce both the absolute number of whistleblowers (by removing the assurance of legal protections against retaliation ) and the percentage of whistleblowers protected against employer retaliation (because the vast majority of whistleblowers report wrongdoing internally before, if ever, reporting to the SEC ); (ii) how the Court refused to defer to the SEC's rulemaking authority pursuant to which it had defined "whistleblower" differently for persons seeking a monetary award under the Dodd-Frank whistleblower statute (which expressly requires reporting to the Commission) versus seeking protection from employer retaliation under the statute (which does not expressly require such reporting) ; and (iii) how the Court summarily declared the statute unambiguousness in a short, two-sentence paragraph.<br />
 <br />
While these implications of the Court's ruling in Digital Realty Trust deserve highlighting, this blog post explores two unexamined, though no less important, aspects of the Court's ruling. First, while the decision was a win for the employer-defendant in this particular case, it will negatively affect employers more generally and undercut companies' internal compliance programs.  Second, the ruling unequivocally harms employee whistleblowers who are obligated by law to report legal violations of employers internally before reporting outside the organization. Chief among these employees are lawyers, duty-bound to report legal violations up the ladder before, if ever, reporting to outside authorities. </p>

<p><u>Harms Employers and Legal Compliance Programs</u></p>

<p>The SEC and the companies it regulates have long expressed support for robust internal compliance programs to which employees can report suspected securities law violations. <br />
 <br />
From the SEC's perspective, deputizing regulated companies to police internal misconduct and promote internal reporting makes eminent sense. Internal reporting, the government argued in <u>Digital Realty Trust</u>, "enables the private sector to screen out meritless claims, and thereby improves the quality of whistleblower tips later brought to the Commission"; it "gives business the opportunity to self-correct without the need for intrusive Commission investigations"; and it "promotes efficient use of both corporate and government resources."  The SEC felt so strongly about the benefits of internal reporting that its regulations provided larger awards for whistleblowers who utilize internal compliance procedures,  and smaller awards for whistleblowers who interfere with those procedures.<br />
  <br />
Companies, too, have a vested interest in employees reporting internally before reporting to the Commission. Internal reporting allows employers to (i) remedy improper conduct at an early stage, perhaps before it rises to the level of a violation; (ii) self-report actual violations to the SEC, which can result in leniency in subsequent enforcement actions; (iii) gather sufficient information of the alleged violation in the eventuality of an enforcement action; (iv) promote and reinforce a culture of compliance within organizations; and (v) highlight the significant value that whistleblowers can add to organizations.<br />
 <br />
As Congress crafted Dodd-Frank and as the SEC drafted regulations to effectuate Congressional intent, support for internal compliance regimes reached a fever pitch. In part, support among regulated entities reflected concern that Dodd-Frank's financial incentives to report wrongdoing would motivate employees to bypass internal reporting channels and go directly to the SEC. Whether motivated by fear of employees reporting out suspected securities-law violations without first alerting the company or a genuine desire to bolster the effectiveness of internal compliance programs, companies rallied around Dodd-Frank's protections against retaliation.<br />
 <br />
In fact, regulated entities and their representatives urged Congress and the SEC to reinforce internal reporting by providing explicit comfort to whistleblowers that the law would protect them from retaliation. "We recognize the valid concern that some employees will fear retaliation for blowing the whistle," the Association of Corporate Counsel told the SEC. "The solution to that problem is not, however, a scheme to undermine important and effective internal compliance and reporting systems; rather, employees who fear retaliation may rely on the anti-retaliation provision contemporaneously enacted by Congress." <br />
 <br />
Companies backed internal reporting to such an extent - and Dodd-Frank's complementary anti-retaliation protections - that they pressed Congress and the SEC to make internal reporting mandatory before an employee could report to the Commission. "An internal reporting requirement is unlikely to have a negative effect on the proposed rules," a prominent law firm wrote on behalf of its corporate clients, "as companies would be given a more immediate opportunity to cure or mitigate potential violations and the whistleblower would remain protected by the anti-retaliation provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act."<br />
  <br />
Ultimately, Congress and the SEC decided not to make internal reporting mandatory. But they included robust protections against retaliation in the Dodd-Frank whistleblower statute.<br />
 <br />
Or so they thought. The Court's ruling in <em>Digital Realty Trust</em> delivered a blow to internal reporting and internal compliance programs. Its decision that Dodd-Frank whistleblowers must report out allegations of securities-law violations to the SEC to be covered by the statute's anti-retaliation provisions will result in untold numbers of whistleblowers bypassing internal reporting systems and going straight to the Commission.<br />
 <br />
From the government's perspective, less internal reporting will reduce voluntary compliance and require more enforcement actions. It will also result in over-reporting of alleged violations to the SEC, including a surge in meritless claims that were previously screened out by internal compliance systems. In turn, over-reporting to the SEC will squander precious government resources.<br />
 <br />
Companies regulated by the SEC are harmed even more directly by the Court's ruling. Indeed, the decision will render companies' internal compliance programs ineffective, undermine the demonstrative benefits of self-policing, increase the number of resource-intensive and intrusive government investigations, and expose employers to rising costs and liability due to undetected securities-law violations. </p>

<p><u>Harms Employees Duty-Bound to Report Internally</u></p>

<p>Employees report misconduct through their employers' internal compliance programs for various reasons. Many employees act out of loyalty and want to give their employer an opportunity to vigorously investigate, root out, and remedy the perceived legal violation.  Some of these employees are either unaware of or unmotivated by potential financial rewards for reporting legal violations outside their organization.  Other employees are required to report internally under their company's code of conduct. And still others are duty-bound to report internally by law and professional ethics.</p>

<p>In the context of U.S. securities law, this last category of employees--those obligated to report legal violations up the corporate ladder--is expansive. Lawyers representing public companies, for example, must report up evidence of a material violation of federal or state securities law or a material breach of fiduciary duty ; registered public accounting firms and their employees must report illegal acts discovered during audits to the audited public company's management ; a mutual fund's chief compliance officer must report material compliance matters to fund's board ; a broker-dealer's auditor must report material inadequacies to the broker-dealer's chief financial officer ; and investment advisers must adopt code of ethics requiring supervised persons to report violations to the chief compliance officer.   </p>

<p>The Court's ruling in <em>Digital Realty Trust</em> harms all of these professionals. Specifically, it prohibits them from invoking the anti-retaliation provisions contained in Dodd-Frank in the event they are retaliated against for reporting legal violations internally but before they have a chance to report the violations to the SEC.<br />
 <br />
For lawyers, the harm is conspicuous and significant. Under the <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/gwbush/sarbanesoxley072302.pdf">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</a> [PDF], lawyers are not just obligated to report certain legal violations up the corporate ladder. They are also required, in the event they receive an inadequate and untimely response from higher-ups, to report to the company's audit committee, an independent committee of the board of directors, or the board itself.  Such exhaustive internal reporting takes time. Indeed, plenty of time to be fired for reporting--and continuing to report - the perceived illegal conduct. Worse, studies indicate that retaliation against whistleblowers occurs quickly, typically immediately after whistleblowers report internally. <br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, lawyers must wait for their clients to respond. And wait. And sometimes wait some more. Even then, their options are limited. Under Sarbanes-Oxley, lawyers can report out evidence of an employer's legal violation only after exhausting all reporting up obligations and, furthermore, only in the event the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent or rectify substantial injury to the employer or investors.  Moreover, ethics rules for lawyers in a majority of states provide similar procedures and requirements before a lawyer can disclose a client's legal violation.<br />
  <br />
In addition, the ethics rules in a minority of jurisdictions further restrict lawyers' reporting out options. In fact, some jurisdictions prohibit lawyers from reporting out financial crimes or non-criminal frauds, leaving lawyers the sole option of withdrawing from the representation. And while there is a good argument (indeed, from the perspective of this commentator, a winning argument) that the rules for attorneys promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley preempt state ethics rules,  that still-unsettled question might offer inadequate assurance for lawyers wishing to blow the whistle on a client's illegal acts by reporting to the SEC.<br />
 <br />
In the end, the decision in <em>Digital Realty Trust</em> harms lawyers for fulfilling their legal and ethical obligations. By removing statutory remedial protections against retaliation for reporting legal violations internally, it exposes lawyers to retaliatory acts without legal recourse. It thereby undermines Congress's mandate in Sarbanes-Oxley that lawyers report up "evidence of a material violation of securities law or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation."  And it undermines the Dodd-Frank whistleblower statute, which, by way of SEC rulemaking authority, explicitly incorporates Congress's mandate that lawyers report up certain legal violations.  </p>

		<title>Do Intellectual Property Rights Extend to Graffiti Art?: The 5Pointz Case</title>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>t was known as 5Pointz but frequently referred to as the "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/20/new-york-graffiti-street-art-5pointz">United Nations of Graffiti</a>." It was a five-story former factory complex in the Queens borough of New York. Aerosol artists from all over the world had from time been invited to paint on it. The artists had the informal permission of the owner of the building and real estate developer Gerald Wolkoff. With time the building became "the repository of the largest collection of exterior aerosol art in the United States" and a "mecca for high-end works by internationally recognized aerosol artists." A significant tourist attraction, 5 Pointz drew thousands of daily visitors and was even featured in a number of movies and music videos including the 2013 motion picture Now You See Me. Eventually Wolkoff wanted to tear the buildings down to make room for some high-rise luxury condos. A group of 5Pointz artists sued Wolkoff and sought a preliminary injunction to prevent a planned demolition. On November 12, 2013, Judge Frederic Block a Brooklyn federal judge denied preliminary injunctive relief but stated that "a written opinion would soon be issued." On November 20, 2013, before a written opinion on the case was issued, Wolkoff ordered the whitewashing of 5Pointz. Almost five years later on February 12, 2018, in <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20180213997">Jonathan Cohen et. al v. G&M Realty L.P. et. al</a>, Judge Block handed down his final verdict on the 5Pointz case essentially ruling that Wolkoff had violated the 'moral rights' of the plaintiffs and awarding the plaintiffs the maximum allowable statutory damages for a total of $6.7 Million. The case "marks the first time that a court has had to determine whether the work of an exterior aerosol artist - given its general ephemeral nature - is <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nyedce/1:2013cv05612/347782/172/">worthy of any protection</a> under the law." The case also marks the first time that graffiti artists have won a lawsuit based on the<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A"> Visual Artists Rights Act</a> (VARA), a 1990 amendment to the federal copyright law. Long considered fringe art, or worse illegal art, graffiti artists have often watched helplessly as their works are destroyed or appropriated by more powerful players. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12126342912820034080&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Cohen v. G&M Realty L.P.</a> suggests that under the right circumstances graffiti art can be protected by existing copyright law.</p>

<p><strong>What is VARA? Why Is It Important?</strong></p>

<p>VARA is the first federal copyright legislation to explicitly recognize and protect two moral rights of artists: the rights of attribution and integrity. Moral rights are distinct from copyrights and rest primarily on the "belief that an artist in the process of creation injects his spirit into the work and that the artist's personality, as well as the integrity of the work, should therefore be protected and preserved." VARA grants to the author of a qualifying work certain rights including: (i) the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of a work in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and (ii) the right to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation. To the author of a "work of recognized stature," VARA grants the additional right "to prevent any intentional or grossly negligent destruction" of such a work.</p>

<p>A work of visual art is defined as including "a painting, drawing, print, or sculpture, existing in a single copy, in a limited edition of 200 copies or fewer that are signed and consecutively numbered by the author."</p>

<p><strong>Graffiti Art and the Intersection of Copyright and Real Estate</strong></p>

<p>Problems inevitably arise when art is incorporated in or made part of a building that is someone else's property. VARA contemplated possible tensions between the moral rights of artists and conventional notions of property rights and addressed them to some extent. First, when a work of visual art can be removed from a building without destroying, mutilating, distorting, or otherwise modifying the said work, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/113">building owner is required</a> to provide a 90 days' written notice to the artist concerned or establish that the owner "has made a diligent, good faith attempt without success to notify the author." Second, when a work of art cannot be removed from a building without destroying, mutilating, distorting, or otherwise modifying the work, the building owner is protected if the artist waives his or her right in written instrument signed both by the artist and the building owner. Wolkoff did not meet either requirement.</p>

<p><strong>The Exploitation of Graffiti Art</strong></p>

<p>Graffiti art has long been considered fringe art, or worse, illegal art. However, over the past two decades, graffiti arts have gained considerable respect and are increasingly exploited by powerful market players. Not surprising, graffiti artists are fighting back using trademark law and copyright law. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12954767698048819977&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Tierney v. Moschino SpA</a>, graffiti artist Joseph Tierney sued fashion house Moschino and famed designer Jeremy Scott, for the unauthorized use of one of his mural on dresses for Moschino's fall/winter 2015 collection. In Aholsniffglue v. American Eagle, David Anasagasti sued American Eagle Outfitters for the unauthorized use of his sleepy-eyeball motif in their worldwide advertising campaign.</p>

<p><strong>What Cohen v. G&M Realty Means for Graffiti Art.</strong></p>

<p>In Cohen v. G&M Realty L.P., the court applying <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13770718910089213453&q=+861+F.Supp.+303,+315+(S.D.N.Y.1994)+&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.</a> determined that 45 of the 49 paintings that were in issue in the case were not only works of visual art but were also 'works of recognized stature.' In concluding that the works had recognition and stature, Judge Block considered the fact that only a handful of works from the thousands were selected for prominence on 5Pointz's long-standing walls, the fact that all the plaintiffs had achieved artistic recognition outside of 5Pointz, and the fact that a highly qualified expert provided detailed findings as to the skill and craftsmanship of the works. Judge Block chose not to be strictly guided by the appraised value of the works in question and appeared to reject the testimony of a fine art appraiser with the art appraisal and acquisition firm Gurr Johns. Indeed, Judge Block observed that "expert testimony is not the sine qua non for establishing that a work of visual art is of recognized stature" and recognized the need for courts to utilize common sense in assessing whether a visual work is of recognized stature.</p>

<p><strong>What Cohen v. G&M Realty Does Not Mean for Graffiti Art.</strong></p>

<p>Cohen v. G&M Realty L.P. does not mean that all graffiti arts are works of recognized stature. The decision does not necessarily limit the rights of building owners vis-à-vis those of graffiti artists. VARA makes a clear distinction between free-standing works of visual art and those works that are "incorporated in or are made part of a building." The author of a work of recognized stature that is incorporated in a building cannot prevent the destruction or alteration of the building but may be able to recover hefty damages if the waiver and/or notice provisions of VARA are not met.</p>

<p>Cohen v. G&M Realty L.P. only addressed a situation where paintings were made with the permission of the building owner. Had the 5Pointz paintings been made without the permission of the building owner, the outcome might have been different.</p>

<p>Does VARA protect temporary works? Although Judge Block concluded that "there is no legal support for the proposition that temporary works do not come within VARA's embrace," other courts may reach a different conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Over 100 years ago the Supreme Court endorsed the aesthetic nondiscrimination doctrine. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3277054592305773876&q=+188+U.S.+239,+251+(1903).&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.</a>, Justice Holmes explained, "[i]t would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme, some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke." These words remain true today.</p>

<p>When it comes to street art, a win-win-win outcome for artists, local communities and building owners may be possible as evidenced by Miami's Wynwood, San Francisco's Mission District, and the Heerlen Murals (the Netherlands). Managed properly, street art can help revitalize communities, raise the value of properties, and provide recognition and possibly income for artists who lack access to more traditional avenues for showcasing artworks.</p>

<p>Cohen v. G&M Realty L.P. serves as a cautionary tale to property owners that are either not aware of VARA's protection or are careless about complying with the statute's waiver and notice requirements. The case is a welcomed relief to artists that work on non-traditional and mixed media and all artists whose works are not considered part of the mainstream.  Although the case does not settle all VARA-related questions, it brings to the fore the critical question of who gets to decide if a work of art has "stature" and "recognition" and what factors are relevant to this determination given changing conception of art and the changing demographics of art consumers.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist Patrick Poon, a China researcher at Amnesty International, discusses the tactics used by Chinese authorities to keep lawyers from changing the political and social environment... </j:header> </p>

<p><strong>W</strong>hen <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/case-history-sui-muqing">Sui Muqing</a> became a lawyer in 1993, he couldn't imagine that 25 years later he would become a "post-lawyer" (lvshihou), a self-deprecating term often used by lawyers in China who have been stripped of their license to practice.</p>

<p>The authorities accused Sui Muqing of confronting a trial judge and separately of taking a picture of his client, dissident writer Chen Yunfei, when visiting him in detention. This was enough for the Guangdong Provincial Department of Justice to formally revoke his license, after a heavily guarded hearing in early February this year.  </p>

<p>However, it is more likely the authorities' motivation was to neuter a vocal and effective human rights lawyer. A thorn in the side of the government, Sui Muqing defended many activists and victims of human rights abuses, including representing high-profile human rights defenders like Guangdong activists <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/case-history-guo-feixiong">Guo Feixiong</a> and <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/case/case-history-wang-qingying">Wang Qingying</a> and Falun Gong practitioners. Together with other lawyers, he had written statements on the difficulties for lawyers in sensitive cases, ranging from not being allowed to meet clients to challenges in defending their clients in court.</p>

<p>Sui Muqing's experience exemplifies how much pressure a lawyer in China faces now if he or she takes up human rights cases considered sensitive by the authorities. Since the crackdown against more than 200 human rights lawyers and activists which began in July 2015, that sparked international condemnation, the authorities have increasingly deployed bureaucracy to stifle these determined voices.</p>

<p>These courageous lawyers have often eschewed more lucrative and less controversial roles and instead chose to help people forced from their homes, religious believers facing persecution and many other victims of human rights violations. They only form a small group among China's 340,000 lawyers but their role in defending human rights is essential. Without these lawyers, many victims of violations will be left without a champion to stand up for their rights.</p>

<p>At least half a dozen human rights lawyers have had their licences revoked or their annual license registrations declined since the crackdown. The tactic has attracted little international criticism so far but has nonetheless been devastatingly effective.  </p>

<p>The government's actions are in clear contravention with international standards that recognize the crucial importance of lawyers in the administration of justice. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RoleOfLawyers.aspx">UN Basic Principles on the Role of the Lawyers</a> clearly state lawyers should be able to carry out their work without fear of intimidation or harassment, or be threatened with sanctions. The principles also underline a lawyer's right to freedom of expression.</p>

<p>Yet the authorities use the most tenuous reasons to disbar those lawyers they see as troublemakers. Shandong lawyer <a href="http://www.chrlawyers.hk/en/content/zhu-shengwu-first-lawyer-having-his-licence-revoked-because-he-speaks-online">Zhu Shengwu</a>'s license was revoked in September 2017 simply because he used the nickname "steam buns" online, which is used by many netizens to ridicule President Xi Jinping. Zhejiang lawyer <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1056912.shtml">Wu Youshui</a> was "under investigation" for his online comments criticizing the government and the Communist Party in August 2017 and was suspended from practicing for nine months. Beijing lawyer Cheng Hai's law firm is running into difficulties with its annual registration which means he needs to find another firm if he is to continue his work.</p>

<p>Their mistreatment strikes at the very heart of the role of defence lawyers in China's legal system. Is it to defend their clients' rights or merely to acquiesce to the government's will? If the latter, lawyers in China are reduced to mere agents of the state. As the number of "post-lawyers" increases, the Chinese government's claims of "rule of law" ring hollow, exposing the favoured concept of "rule by law with Chinese characteristics" for the sham it is. It is evidenced in former Minister of Justice Zhang Jun's commentary in the People's Daily in January 2018 in which he said strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's role among lawyers is "the core part and fundamental measure" in deepening the reform of the legal system. It bluntly puts the Party above the law.</p>

<p>Two weeks before Sui Muqing's license was revoked, Beijing lawyer Yu Wensheng was informed his license had been suspended. The authorities didn't stop there. A few days later he was detained by police, while taking his son to school.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/world/asia/china-yu-wensheng-rights-lawyer.html">Yu Wensheng</a> stands accused of "inciting subversion of state power" and has been placed under "residential surveillance in a designated location", a de facto incommunicado detention for charges of "endangering national security".</p>

<p>While it's still unclear why he was detained, his friends believe that Yu Wensheng was targeted because of an open letter he wrote in October 2017 in which he criticized Xi Jinping as not being a good leader of the country. Sadly, the authorities are still prepared to arbitrarily use the law with full force against those that dare offer an opinion that differs from the government's line.</p>

<p>Yu Wensheng's family are concerned he will be subjected to torture in detention as he was the last time he was incarcerated for 99 days in late 2014 and early 2015 after he showed support for the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Many human rights lawyers say that the problems they face in the annual registration of their licenses or their law firms ending their contracts because of government pressure, is only the beginning of their nightmare. In some cases, like Sui Muqing and Yu Wensheng, their family members are also subjected to harassment, not to mention the financial hardship of losing their livelihood. </p>

<p>These dedicated lawyers have become outcasts in China's legal community. The government-approved All-China Lawyers Association has joined the authorities' effort to discredit them, instead of protecting lawyers as outlined in its charter. The semi-official association has accused human rights lawyers of breaking laws and regulations. It has attempted to marginalize them as "troublemakers". However, the intimidation has not scared off these and other brave lawyers in taking up human rights cases or in exercising their own rights.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, there were less than a dozen known lawyers who took up human rights cases. The number of lawyers taking up human rights cases now, not to mention those who take up the less sensitive public interest cases, has grown to a few hundred, if not a thousand.</p>

<p>Their sheer effectiveness in protecting the human rights of others resulted in the harsh backlash from the authorities. With the government tightening its grip on the legal profession and civil society in general, there are sadly likely to be more 'post lawyers' in China. Yet there is hope, for despite everything the government throws at them, these remarkable lawyers remain resolute.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University, discusses the implications of a hasty withdrawl from Syria...</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>resident Donald Trump recently <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/trump-troops-syria-180329195309816.html">announced</a> his intention to get out of Syria, "very soon." The president's stated intention here could soon run starkly counter to this country's urgent obligations under binding international law. Moreover, because these important obligations have already been "incorporated" into the law of the United States (see especially <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI</a> of the US Constitution; and two prominent cases from the US Supreme Court: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5818762505482150880&q=Paquete+Habana&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Paquete Habana</span></a>, 1900; and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2472562080683506761&q=Tel+Oren+versus+Libyan+Arab+Republic&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Tel Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic</span></a>, 1984) they would also express very serious violations of America's domestic law.</p>

<p>In essence, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CrimeOfGenocide.aspx">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> (1948), a major international treaty to which the US is a party, obliges its signatories not only to steer clear of committing genocide themselves, but also to oppose and prevent genocidal behavior by other states. At Article III of the Convention, this unequivocal obligation extends to certain grave acts involving "conspiracy to commit genocide," "attempt to commit genocide," and "complicity in genocide." Such immutably core expectations are known in law as "peremptory" or "<em>jus cogens</em>" rules -  that is, obligations that permit absolutely "no derogation." Significantly, they can be discovered as well in various corollary and complementary expressions of authoritative international law, both customary and codified.<br />
	<br />
Neither international nor US law specifically advises any particular penalties or sanctions for states that choose not to prevent or punish genocide committed by others. Nonetheless, all states, most notably the "major powers" belonging to the UN Security Council, are bound, among other things, by the peremptory obligation (defined at Article 26 of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume 1155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>) known as pacta sunt servanda, to act in continuous "good faith." In turn, this pacta sunt servanda obligation is itself derived from an even more basic norm of world law. Commonly known as "mutual assistance," this civilizing norm was most famously identified within the classical interstices of international jurisprudence, most notably by the eighteenth-century legal scholar, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmerich-de-Vattel">Emmerich de Vattel</a>.<br />
	<br />
As an historic and meaningful aside, Vattel, whose <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmerich-de-Vattel"><em>The Law of Nations</em></a> had first been published in 1758, was a favorite literary source of Thomas Jefferson. This American founding father had expressly relied upon his brilliant Swiss antecedent for many of the key principles he later included in the Declaration of Independence.<br />
	<br />
Today, the relevant problem is that a proposed US military withdrawal from Syria, including an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/02/598885081/trump-freezes-syria-aid-funds-sends-mixed-messages-on-anti-isis-strategy">already-announced</a> presidential order to freeze over $200 million in aid to that fractured country, would substantially strengthen Vladimir Putin's hold over Bashar al Assad, and thereby further accelerate the Syrian dictator's unambiguously genocidal policies. While it would make little overall sense to urge any further or more extensive US military involvement in the Syrian imbroglio per se - an escalating involvement that would eventually come to no military success, notwithstanding various other current arguments against US withdrawal based on a presumed need to counter ISIS and related Jihadist forces -  President Trump ought still make clear that al Assad's grievous criminality could not now proceed with even greater impunity. At a minimum, this means offering various tangible administration assurances that any intended US military disengagement would not signify a wholesale American abandonment of Syria in the face of any still-expanding genocide.<br />
	<br />
In the strictest sense, although the United States could never be held  meaningfully accountable under law for any such abandonment of the Syrian people,  this departure would still plainly violate utterly core expectations of the international anti-genocide regime, going back, inter alia, to the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imtchart.asp">London Charter of August 8, 1945</a>; the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/">UN Charter</a> (1945); the <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-Operation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations</a> (1970); <a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a1r95.htm">Affirmation of the Principles of International Law Recognized by the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal</a> (1946, 1950); and the International Law Commission (ILC) <a href="https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/international-law-commission-articles-state-responsibility">Articles on State Responsibility</a> (2001).<br />
	<br />
In its landmark judgment of 26 February 2007 "<a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/91/091-20070226-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf">Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a>" (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled, inter alia, that all Contracting Parties have a direct obligation to "prevent genocide." Indeed, somewhat counter-intuitively, the ICJ even found it easier to acknowledge this obligation expressis verbis than the (expectedly antecedent) requirement "not to commit genocide themselves."  </p>

<p>There is more. US President Trump's favored posture of "America First" is itself an impediment to properly enforcing anti-genocide legal norms. For this president especially, certain presumed imperatives of geopolitical advantage are sure to take precedence over any more abstract or inconspicuous legal notions of "mutual assistance." But for those few remaining Americans who might still take seriously a flippant president's plainly willful disregard of this nation's fundamental legal obligations and responsibilities - expectations as urgent as preventing cascading instances of mass murder in the Arab Middle East - such likely Trump abandonment could signify this country's regrettable devolution from a once great nation to a de facto "co-conspirator" in relentless Syrian regime crimes against humanity.<br />
	<br />
Niccolo Machiavelii had fused Aristotle's plans for a more scientific study of world politics with brutally cynical assumptions about geopolitics, or Realpolitik.  His best known conclusion, in this regard, focused on the timeless dilemma of practicing goodness in an evil world: "A man who wishes to make a profession of goodness in everything must necessarily come to grief among so many who are not good" (see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm">The Prince</a>, Chapter XV). <br />
	<br />
If taken too literally, this advice could lead not only individuals, but also entire nations, toward an insufferably primal "state of nature." This movement would describe a condition of fully rampant anarchy and disorder, one perhaps best explained by another classic political philosopher, the seventeenth century Englishman Thomas Hobbes. In his <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm">Leviathan</a> (also well-known to America's Thomas Jefferson), the life of man in this raw or "every man for himself" state is inevitably plain. This corrosively sad life, we would learn, must inevitably be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."<br />
	<br />
<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1945/mistral-bio.html">Gabriela Mistral</a>, the Chilean poet who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945, once wrote that crimes against humanity carry within themselves "a moral judgment over an evil in which every feeling man and woman concurs." At this critical juncture in our national history, one where an American president is evidently prepared to abandon our pragmatic interests and our national legal obligations at the same time, a manifestly last hope must lie in the following awareness: Surrendering Syria's devastated populations to an all-out regime generated genocide would represent an ultimate American disregard for pertinent law. More precisely, and even irreversibly, it would conspicuously align the United States not with the proponents of global justice, but with the perpetrators of genocide.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnists, Sarah Wetter and James G. Hodge, Jr. of the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University, discuss preemptive legal schemes that deprive states and localities of opportunities to implement efficacious interventions to advance public health...</p>

<p>The constitutional legal doctrine of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0121.htm">preemption</a> refers to how state or local laws may be invalidated expressly or impliedly by laws at higher levels of government. Preemption has the potential to improve public health standards by leveling efforts across jurisdictions. However, federal and state governments can also use preemption to block or foreclose lower level public health innovations across an array of areas (e.g., nutrition, gun control, paid sick and safe time (PSST)). </p>

<p>Worse yet, preemptive laws are increasingly supplemented with penalties, loss of authority, or other disincentives for noncomplying lower-level governments. These "<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1073110517703110">preemption plus</a>" schemes deprive states and localities of opportunities to implement efficacious interventions to advance public health.</p>

<p>This commentary explains preemption plus tactics and corresponding risks, particularly the chilling of local public health innovations in legally-suspect ways. </p>

<p><strong>Preemption Plus Strategies and Trends</strong></p>

<p>Whether flowing from federal supremacy or state sovereignty, preemption is designed to assure order among competing laws across governments. However, complications arise from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22759986">dual capacities</a> of preemption to promote or hinder diverse public health objectives. For example, federal preemption may be used positively to create a national baseline for public health interventions (e.g., minimum <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/12/01/2014-27833/food-labeling-nutrition-labeling-of-standard-menu-items-in-restaurants-and-similar-retail-food">menu labeling</a> standards). Conversely, it can be wielded by law- and policy-makers to stymie public health legal innovations.</p>

<p>Inclusion of punitive provisions in preemption legislation or regulation present an even greater threat to public health authority.  Federal and state law- and policy-makers are turning to "plus" strategies that exceed traditional boundaries or specific targets of preemption. They include <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=604064031098124100067125079079077103018051001046052028106016015094006111078113031069062043121044102001042024090004118109089110024070038021022093065111031003077104037021071009123086003097014068107067067024080106106119100106122065085025093001005090022&EXT=pdf">divisive provisions </a> [PDF] imposing direct threats or excessive fines, threatening substantial loss of funds, or broadly stripping existing local powers. State or localities are essentially forced to comply with laws that are antithetical to public health. </p>

<p>For example, several state legislatures punish local actors seeking to implement ordinances or other laws contrary to state prerogatives. A 2011 pro-gun preemption <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0790/Sections/0790.33.html">statute in Florida</a> penalizes offending local officials with fines up to $5,000, loss of governmental immunity to lawsuits, and even removal from public office or employment. A 2015 <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(vsifrgk21uavou50aenzo4yc))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=2015-HB-4795">Michigan state bill</a> would require rapid repeal of preempted local firearm ordinances, allow lawsuits against non-compliant local officials, and make localities accountable for associated legal costs and fines.</p>

<p>Massive funding withdrawals are another tactic. A 2016 <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/arizona/2016/title-41/section-41-194.01/">Arizona statute </a>authorizes the attorney general to investigate any local action allegedly preempted by state law and withhold all state funds from offending localities.  Threats of defunding alone in Arizona have curtailed local public health initiatives to implement PSST in Tempe, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/10/31/bisbee-plastic-bag-ordinance-repeal-attorney-general-mark-brnovich-ruling/819584001/">ban plastic bags</a> in Bisbee, and melt down guns confiscated by police in Tucson. In 2017, Tucson lost a <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/arizona/supreme-court/2017/cv-16-0301-sa.html">judicial challenge</a> of the statute, resulting in its complete repeal of its ordinance. President Trump's <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13768.php">Executive Order 13768</a> and dozens of state bills propose the withdrawal of certain federal or state funds from "<a href="/paperchase/2018/03/trump-administration-files-lawsuit-against-california-over-sanctuary-city-laws.php">sanctuary cities</a>" that allegedly run afoul of immigration laws.</p>

<p>Other localities may find the full range of their "home rule" authority swept away. After the city of Denton banned fracking via local ordinance, Texas' legislature could have just preempted all local fracking laws. Instead, it enacted a bill in 2015 <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/12/h-b-40-84th-leg-reg-sess-tex-2015/">banning localities</a> from regulating any facets of oil and gas operations. <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/HB00540I.htm">Another bill </a>proposed in the same legislative session would have prohibited adoption of local laws on all matters, including health, safety, and welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Public Health Implications of Preemption Plus Strategies</strong></p>

<p>Since multiple factors contribute to preventable morbidity and mortality, correlating preemptive strategies and negative public health outcomes is difficult. Still, repercussions of preemption plus tactics on public health interventions are felt across various domains.</p>

<p><em>Nutrition.</em> Over 70% of U.S. adults are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm">overweight or obese</a>. Innovative proposals to curb obesity and overweightness proliferate. Many localities proffer science-backed <a href="http://health.usf.edu/nocms/authorware/cbpm/cbpmstep1/resources/ChildhoodObesity.pdf">laws and policies</a> [PDF] to curb food or drink portion sizes, inform consumers on nutritional content, and restrict food marketing to children. Multiple municipalities, however, are essentially barred from similar proposals via preemption plus. Almost 1/3 of <a href="https://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/">populations</a> in Ohio and Kansas are obese. In Mississippi, nearly 40% (~800,000 adults) are obese, placing it second highest among all states. Still, these states' legislatures have <a href="https://grassrootschange.net/preemption-watch/#/category/nutrition">sweepingly removed</a> local nutrition-related authorities. <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3717.53">Ohio</a> and <a href="http://grassrootschange.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Miss-%C2%A7-75-29-901-.pdf">Mississippi</a> [PDF] eliminated local authority to prohibit toys from kids' meals, require restaurants to post calorie counts, and regulate food service operations on the basis of health disparities. <a href="http://www.ksrevisor.org/statutes/chapters/ch12/012_016_0137.html">Kansas law</a> removes virtually all local authority over nutrition, food policy, and farming practices. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.azdhs.gov/topics/index.php#obesity-prevention-home">Arizona</a>, over 17% of kids are obese, ranking it as the 15th highest state for childhood obesity. Yet Arizona (1) prohibits local regulation of restaurant-provided <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/44/01380.htm">incentive items</a>, and (2) preempts localities from taxing <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/70547">sugar sweetened beverages</a> (SSBs) despite <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002283">early evidence</a> suggesting even modest SSB taxes can <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2016/curtail-sugary-drinks/en/">decrease sales</a> and consumption, especially among lower income consumers.  Both of these state-level policies are backed by the afore-mentioned preemption plus funding scheme. As a result, any Arizona municipality that attempts to ban toys from kids' meals or tax SSBs stands to lose all its state funding.  </p>

<p><em>Gun control. </em>On February 14, 2018, the <a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/the_network_blog/2018/04/03/986/a_nations_response_to_the_school_shooting_in_parkland_florida">school shooting</a> at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida (17 dead, 15 injured) fueled national calls for strengthened firearm legislation. While the "right to bear arms" via the 2nd Amendment may proscribe overly-aggressive <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html">gun control measures</a>, preemption is a prime mechanism used to tamp down reasonable gun control innovations. <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/pjx037.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAcIwggG-BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGvMIIBqwIBADCCAaQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMgqvBec7gry7NhJfPAgEQgIIBdTamPI6OHLy_4tXlZPUr34DPbC2MmV9TF-Ma-CVpJsHFjlW2nCD-T7W18iPD8cbLhnM_HGxdZFBlQpROYE5N_YUJzq0BmKvBVE9R_8pH28LY8MsRG1xyT0O56f08dVuJ2jOwHzKwDQL9ltyWaiAUctzpFss8pQB3Q2vgX9GDt9lZwVqWs_AnUQSGvIzMgOEF7d2j8CW1QAsaSqYAiycWEUbL-7ndxhMVEuFHUV8frHFX4o3h4eA5SfpbyzjooGPLNVPXYPZ1VIei9Cgi5h6Lp1RfPiGMNL2v0yrYDR3VcyL7axSGGwDxwKhy_NFwEo2OB7m0da7ijuzUWYIWMF5x71PJgtyde903pA6m82XBeXX7poc2CVXVEnsQNN1wD4O9fokz8eTeG5LGEak5D_p48KROydzCAKQM5fyK6igw61olgIGlHuD60Ia93XGK7Dh1mryYvWZM-AR1LvlYfht9X53JTyV6OpYCaUkv4HIyEFU0umG9MNY">All but</a> seven states (CA, CT, HI, MA, NE, NJ, NY) broadly preempt local firearm regulations. Each of the non-preempting states is ranked within the top 11 states with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm">lowest</a> firearm-related mortality rates (as of 2016). </p>

<p>In non-preempting states, localities have demonstrated efficacy in reducing gun violence through <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL283.html">laws </a>such as stronger licensing provisions, safer gun storage requirements, bans on deadlier weapons/accessories, and purchase restrictions (e.g., age limits, waiting periods). California state law <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/article189213039.html">requires</a> online ammunition purchases to be sent to a licensed vendor (rather than one's home) with accompanying processing fees. It is a new statewide measure predated by similar ordinances in Sacramento and other California cities. </p>

<p>Conversely, states with expansive firearm-related preemptive laws may forego local innovations. Preemption plus laws in at least <a href="http://lawcenter.giffords.org/gun-laws/policy-areas/other-laws-policies/preemption-of-local-laws/">five states</a> (AZ, IA, KY, MN, MS) mimic Florida's harsh penalties against local officials who enact or enforce contrary gun laws. Stripping local legislative roles through threats of judicial or executive interventions intimidate officials from proposing and enforcing laws designed to reduce gun violence and enhance community safety. </p>

<p><em>Paid sick and safe time.</em> During the <a href="https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/16/11/05/support-for-paid-sick-leave-and-family-leave-policies">2009</a> <a href="/forum/2009/05/fighting-h1n1-why-laws-are-not-answer.php">H1N1 outbreak</a>, 7 million U.S. H1N1 cases were attributed to employees coming to work sick, ultimately contributing to 1,500 deaths. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.12471">Many of</a> the more than 50 million American workers lacking PSST benefits come from low income or single parent households unable to afford even a single unpaid day off of work. PSST laws in Seattle and other locales have demonstrated efficacy in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22095353">reducing the spread </a>of contagious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, as compared with non-enacting jurisdictions. They lead to <a href="https://iwpr.org/wp-content/uploads/wpallimport/files/iwpr-export/publications/B361.pdf">increased use</a> [PDF] of treatment and preventive care, improved family health, and stabilized income and employment. In 2015, President Obama signed an <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/obama-to-issue-order-ensuring-sick-leave-for-federal-contractor-employees.php">executive order</a> mandating PSST for federal contractor employees. As of February 2018, 9 states, D.C., and over 30 U.S. localities legally <a href="http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/psd/paid-sick-days-statutes.pdf">require employers</a> to grant eligible employees PSST benefits.</p>

<p>Yet a wave of states' legislatures have expressly preempted local PSST efforts. In Arizona, Tempe's <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2016/02/27/state-threat-prompts-tempe-council-drop-sick-leave-proposal/80712240/">consideration</a> of a PSST ordinance was quashed in 2016 due to the state's preemption plus law. Fortunately, Tempe's proposal lent to a state-wide <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Minimum_Wage_and_Paid_Time_Off,_Proposition_206_(2016)">PSST law </a>providing similar protections the following year. These benefits may be short-lived. In 2018, the Arizona Legislature is considering <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SCR1016/2018">a resolution</a> to eliminate the mandatory PSST provision. Proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr4219/BILLS-115hr4219ih.pdf">federal legislation</a> [PDF] to prohibit all state and local PSST mandates while providing minimal benefits for workers remains in Congressional committee review. Preempting state and local PSST laws threatens the health of workers, their families, and all Americans. <br />
________</p>

<p>Like a double-edged sword, preemption may be wielded to ensure uniform, baseline standards essential to public health promotion.  Conversely preemption plus strategies have reduced the capacity of state and local governments to advance responsible public health regulations. Funding withdrawals, elimination of authority, and penalties including fines, lawsuits, and removal from office affect multiple public health arenas. Absent greater challenges, the rise of preemption plus laws forecloses local public health innovations essential to averting existing and emerging public health threats and advancing health equity.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ui-box -border">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/polsci/directory/?p=Louis_Beres">Louis René Beres</a> of Purdue University discusses the true nature of President Donald Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin...</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/03/04/at-a-white-tie-media-dinner-president-trump-tries-joking-i-like-chaos/">I like chaos</a>." &#8212 United States President Donald Trump, March 4, 2018</p>

<p><em>Credo quia absurdum</em>. "I believe because it is absurd." In the very best case scenario, President Donald Trump is "merely" incompetent, <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/former-cia-chief-john-brennan-blasts-trump-unstable-inept-inexperienced-and-also-unethical.html">fundamentally incapable</a> of meeting minimal intellectual and emotional expectations of the American presidency.  In the worst case, he is acting consciously on behalf of his Russian counterpart, expressly driven by Vladimir Putin to sow chaos and eventual capitulation in the United States.</p>

<p>Significantly, however, even the second case explanation need not imply any hatred or disloyalty toward Mr. Trump's own country. It suggests only that Mr. Putin has such overwhelmingly damaging personal information at his disposal that Donald Trump no longer maintains any "rational" alternative to collaborating against core American national interests. Following such more-or-less plausible extrapolations from ordinary logic, the people of the United States can now choose to examine all pertinent evidence with appropriate care and attention, or they can continue to assume that even an outrageously objectionable US president may nonetheless be sane and/or uncorrupted. </p>

<p>If they should choose the latter, they could commit a very familiar human error in reasoning, a fallacy, siding lazily with blind faith over science and truth. Undoubtedly, Sigmund Freud would have called this behavior a textbook example of "<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/Sigmund-Freud.html">wish fulfillment</a>," the very same term he used to explain religion. All the more so, perhaps, because Mr. Trump now continues to express his fierce admiration for foreign dictators and "strongmen" in general, and to impose selective tariffs that would specifically undermine the US aerospace and defense industry.</p>

<p>If, however, the American People should opt instead for a properly systematic assessment, they might then offer their imperiled country a seemingly last chance to be taken seriously, and also to remain recognizably decent before the wider community of nations.</p>

<p>In the very early years of German National Socialism, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, speaking proudly against science and truth, intoned ominously: "Intellect rots the brain." From the beginning, US President Donald Trump has deliberately surrounded himself with subordinates who routinely oppose any capable iterations of measured analytic thought. Even when his highest-level appointments have become downright caricatural or cartoonish -  e.g., when his appointees are selected precisely because they oppose the objectives and interests of the federal department to which they are being directed - the public reaction somehow stops palpably short of any needed incredulity. </p>

<p>Certain other fundamental questions ought now arise. Exactly what kind of American democracy stands solidly against human rights both inside and outside of its own borders, rights expressly guaranteed to all by the "sacred" founding documents of the United States? </p>

<p>(By their definition, the rights assured by the Declaration of Independence and Constitution can never be confined to only the people of the United States. This is because both documents were conceived by their authors as the indisputable codification of a pre-existing Natural Law. Although generally unrecognized, the United States was expressly founded upon the Natural Rights philosophies of the 18th century Enlightenment, especially Locke, Hobbes, Montesquieu and Rousseau. Thomas Jefferson, an American president before Donald Trump, was well acquainted with the classic writings of political philosophy, from Plato to Diderot. In those early days of the Republic, it is presently worth recalling, an American president could not only read serious books, but could also write them.)</p>

<p>The only correct answer, in this case, is a nation that is willing to violate not only relevant international law, but also its own domestic or municipal legal rules. This is because international law, whether customary or codified, has long been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5818762505482150880">unambiguously incorporated</a> into the "supreme law" of the United States.</p>

<p>When President Trump's executive orders direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to expand his coercive program of "<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/immigration/321102-what-expedited-removal-really-means-for-illegal-immigrants-in">expedited removal</a>" (of selected immigrants, to their inhospitable countries of origin), he is frequently in violation of the legal principle known as non-refoulement, as codified (inter alia) at Article 33 of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/1951-refugee-convention.html">1951 Refugee Convention</a>. Automatically, owing to the prior incorporation of international human rights law into US law, these very serious violations extend as well to the authoritative immigration laws of the United States.<br />
 <br />
Similar and intersecting legal issues must now be raised with regard to this president's explicit country preferences concerning future immigration to the United States. When Mr. Trump openly urges reduced immigration from "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-countries-trump/index.html">shithole countries</a>," which just happen to be in Africa and Latin America or the Caribbean, and calls instead for refugees from "places like Norway," it is a thinly disguised retrogression to Third Reich-type criteria. In essence, and without any conspicuous subtlety, President  Trump has been nudging America toward an immigration posture of "pure blood," an inherently egregious  stance that would openly prefer "pure" (read "Aryan" type) immigrants to all others.</p>

<p>The fact that such crude and inhumane presidential thinking is allowed to pass as merely "coarse," "prejudiced," "foolish" or "narrow minded" misses a very key antecedent point. It is that determinedly racist stereotypes are integral to President Trump's core persona, and thus help fashion his actual policies. In this connection, one need now be reminded that despite America's codified and customary legal obligations to oppose genocide-like crimes<a href="/paperchase/2018/03/un-rights-expert-syria-war-a-colossal-human-tragedy.php"> in Syria</a> - obligations discoverable, among other sources, at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1948+genocide+convention&oq=1948+genoci&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.4472j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">1948 Genocide Convention</a>  - Mr. Trump chooses to stand silently by the overtly murderous Syria policy of his never-criticized counterpart ("master"?) in Moscow. </p>

<p>Under absolutely no circumstances, it should be obvious, would this American president ever stand up against crimes of war and crimes against humanity where they have first been "authorized" by Vladimir Putin. For the United States, this stunningly unique presidential unwillingness means opposing our interests and our ideals at the same time. For us, moreover, this can signify nothing less than abandoning our indispensable rights and corresponding privileges for the sake of maintaining a contemptible and potentially catastrophic American presidency.</p>

<p>Going forward, when we should sometime look back at what we had once allowed, what will be the excuse for our de facto complicity with such plainly defiled American governance? Will it be that the apparent facts of Mr. Trump's "cooperation" with Vladimir Putin were just never sufficiently clear or compelling? If so, then we may all soon have to learn to "love chaos."</p>

		<title>Toward the Effective Judicial Review in Iraq</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JUIRST Guest Columnist Oday Talal Mahmood of the <a href="http://law.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> discusses the potential implications of judicial review in Iraq....</j:header><strong>I</strong>n <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iraq_2005.pdf?lang=en">Iraq's Constitution of 2005</a>, more than 67  of the 144 Articles include the language: "shall be regulated by law," referring to the most important laws including the Federation Council Law, and the Oil and Gas Law. Aside from these laws, there are some others which need to be enacted by the Iraqi Parliament. All of these essential laws are concentrated in the institutional structure of the country. The Federal Supreme Court in Iraq has to review all of these laws in case there is a challenge to their constitutionality. Before 2003, there was no judicial review in Iraq. Thus, this is a new method of legal scrutiny and Article 2 was fundamental to the establishment of a judicial review mechanism in Iraq. This Article established the Repugnancy Clause, which stipulated that the Iraqi legislature cannot enact any law which is contrary to the Islamic settled rulings, democracy, and human rights. In practice, adding a religious component to the standard of judicial review may raise concerns about the influence of religion on the governance of a young democratic country. Especially considering the fact that the Court's decisions would be superior and binding on other branches. Furthermore, the Court's decisions are often still controversial.</p>

<p>The provision of the Federal Court's right to a constitutional review was made clear in Article 93. In Article 2, the Constitution clearly outlines the standards of review a constitutional judge must follow to determine whether or not laws are constitutional. However, what is lacking in the Iraqi constitutional judiciary is the courage to render stricter decisions to protect the Constitution. This courage will not come unless constitutional judges are free from the texts of ordinary laws and rely solely on constitutional values, logic, and reason. The function of the constitutional judge is quite different from the ordinary judge, and no less important than the legislator in achieving the interests of society. For example, an ill-conceived judicial decision may ignite civil war or undermine a basic right enshrined in the Constitution. </p>

<p>Today, the Federal Supreme Court in Iraq is bound by the imaginary limitations of the difficulty in the application of Article 2 of the Constitution, which contains elements that some may consider incompatible with Islamic settled rulings, democracy, and human rights. Regardless of the philosophical interpretations of these elements, there are two solutions for this problem. First, procedurally, the court can enable parties to submit adversarial briefs asking them to describe specific issues of Islamic settled rulings, democracy, and human rights. The other solution is to accelerate the formation of the court structure as Article 92 provided: "The Federal Supreme Court shall be made up of a number of judges, experts in Islamic jurisprudence, and legal scholars." This solution will ensure that each member of the court will bear his or her moral, legal, and intellectual responsibility that the interpretation of these concepts aligns with the needs of the community. It will also ensure that the interpretation is in a way that secures the operation of the Article and does not disrupt the Constitution. The effective judicial review of the laws today in Iraq is an important factor in the success of the democratic rule. This can establish the loyalty of all the government institutions in the country to the Constitution and prevent the emergence of another dictatorship.</p>

<p><em><strong>N</strong>ullum crimen sine poena</em>, "No crime without a punishment."</p>
<p>(Ancient principle of law reaffirmed at the Nuremberg Trials)</p>
<p>	For the most part, a military response to the recent Syrian chemical attacks at Douma was obligatory under the authoritative international law. The system of world law as originally established under the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Peace-of-Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> (1648) is largely based on "self-help." This system of "self-help" requires major world powers to accept pertinent enforcement responsibilities. Ideally, the major world powers would have resolved the Syrian conflict within the treaty-shaped boundaries of the UN Security Council. Unfortunately, that was a not an option and the military action launched by the United States, France, and United Kingdom was fundamentally necessary and proper. </p>
<p>	In part, at least, this residual permissibility stemmed from Russia's expected further use of the veto at the United Nations. Russia had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/politics/assad-syria-sarin-gas/index.html">recently vetoed</a> a markedly reasonable Security Council resolution condemning Syrian war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>	Although the very recent use of force against Syrian chemical weapons-related sites by three allied powers was presumptively just and lawful, this military response still needed to conform to all ordinary expectations of the law of war, aka humanitarian international law. Appropriately, in this connection, it does appear that the forceful response was verifiably discriminate, proportionate and within both codified and customary parameters of military necessity.</p>
<p>	To offer a somewhat narrower legal observation, the allied right to act against Bashar al-Assad's relevant military assets in Syria stemmed, inter alia, from assorted basic obligations defined at the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/charter-united-nations">UN Charter</a> ; t<a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">he Genocide Convention</a>; and multiple other human rights conventions. Going ahead, the key challenge for Mr. Trump and his allies remains what it was before the coordinated strikes -  that is, meeting all proper military and legal objectives without simultaneously being caught up in a prospectively nuclear confrontation with Russia. </p>
<p>	The core dangers are still real and potentially existential.  In this regard, it is plausible that Mr. Putin will soon deploy additional Russian soldiers to some of those areas most likely to be targeted by any future allied attacks. In the expressly technical language of nuclear deterrence theory, any such deployment would then be characterized as a "trip wire." Accordingly, the real purpose of these additional Russian troops would not be to fight against the Americans (there could never be any strategic or tactical advantage from such a fight), but rather to "trip" certain further escalations with the United States. </p>
<p>	It's not that Putin would welcome any such escalations per se, but that he would expect this particular sort of deployment to further strengthen his overall (and still plausibly indispensable) deterrence posture in the volatile region.</p>
<p>	For Mr. Putin, all of this would represent a substantial gamble, one that could quickly escalate out of control toward either an inadvertent or (especially during the later stages of any protracted conflict) deliberate nuclear war. Pursuant to what is generally known about determining probabilities in unprecedented circumstances - that is, that such probabilities are simply not ascertainable for unique events - there would be available no reliable ways to calculate just how it would all end. Presently, in addition to variously relevant jurisprudential considerations, this sobering inconclusiveness should be viewed as a "red flag" by both Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>	Under no circumstances should the American president conclude from his "one-shot encounter" with Syria that all pre-existing dangers have already passed. The Russian soldiers deployed in Syria will only have a real function in a direct encounter with American forces. In essence, that function will be to die. They could and would serve absolutely no other military function. Even if Mr. Putin should not expressly augment such a "tripwire" Russian force, his previously dispersed S-400 advanced surface-to-air missile systems could elicit the very same perilous consequences in any future encounters with allied bombs and missiles. </p>
<p>	Because the Americans could easily decide to strike these important air-defense targets first in any such future encounters, Russian military personnel could then be among the first recognizable casualties of superpower military engagement in Syria.<br />
	<br />
        Then what?</p>
<p>	 At that perilous stage, we must now already inquire, how should President Trump and his allies most effectively proceed? President Trump's residual policy options here could unwittingly lead to a direct and potentially irreversible US-Russian military encounter. To prevent this altogether, or at least to blunt the likelihood, the president's most capable strategic thinkers (not his tactical military planners) would then need to work very quickly (among other things) through the unimaginably complex dialectics of virtually all possible nuclear conflict scenarios and outcomes.</p>
<p>	At that stage, could these vital thinkers possibly manage such staggering calculations in the total absence of historical experience or precedent, and in such sorely compressed time-urgent circumstances?</p>
<p>	In sum, what will be needed here will be exceptional intellectual skills, not in lieu of the usual military operational talents, but in addition to them. Above all, these complementary intellectual expectations would need to be satisfied suitably prior to any actual US-Russian engagements, and not be anterior to them. Can Mr. Trump and his counselors expectedly succeed at this very demanding level of analytic reflection? And can they succeed while simultaneously managing to support various peremptory (jus cogens) norms of binding international law?</p>
<p>	To be sure, it would be dreadfully ironic if an American president's alleged commitment to international law enforcement led this country into a superpower nuclear war. Prima facie, in such intolerable but still foreseeable circumstances, any allegedly "successful" commitment to law enforcement would clearly have become utterly moot.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/chris-hoofnagle/">Chris Hoofnagle</a> of <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Law</a>, discusses the policing of Facebook's privacy policies and  FTC enforcement ...</j:header></p>
<p><strong>The Challenge of Policing Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Are our institutions up to the challenge of protecting users from information-age problems? This is the high-level question emerging from the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">debate</a>. While on one hand Facebook and similarly-situated companies will pay some regulatory price, our public institutions are also in the crosshairs. In the U.S., the much-praised and admired Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") approach is <a href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/665918/can-ftc-handle-facebooks-digital-privacy-challenge?mref=dashboard-lead-1">suffering</a> a crisis of legitimacy.  Facebook's European regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner, is losing both control over its supervision of American companies and the respect of its regulatory colleagues. In a recent <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=50999">press release</a>, the Article 29 Working Party announced that it was creating a working group focusing on social media, never mentioning the Irish in its statement.</p>
<p>In this essay I explain the challenges the FTC faces in enforcing its 2012 consent agreement against Facebook and suggest ways it could nonetheless prevail. In the long run, everyone wins if our civil society institutions can police Facebook, including the company itself. While Facebook's privacy problems have long been dismissed as harmless, advertising-related controversies, all now understand Facebook's power over our broader information environment. After Brexit, the 2016 U.S. election, and violence in Myanmar, if consumer law fails, we risk turning to more heavy-handed regulatory tools, including <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/The Rising Geopolitics_2016.pdf">cyber sovereignty</a> approaches,  with attendant consequences for civil society and internet freedom.</p>
<p><strong>FTC and Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Facebook is already under a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2012/08/120810facebookcmpt.pdf">FTC consent agreement</a> with broad restrictions to fence in aggressive data use.  The 2012 agreement was a major victory for the FTC because it firmly established the notion that the information-age bait and switch, those privacy-eroding settings changes that are pushed onto users, are not acceptable without opt-in consent. The FTC understood the app problem and crafted its first and fourth complaint counts against Facebook data transfers to developers.</p>
<p>When Facebook settled the case, a wide range of critics pointed out weaknesses in the agreement. Republican-appointed Commissioner Rosch <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2012/08/dissenting-statement-commissioner-j-thomas-rosch-matter-facebook-inc">objected</a> that Facebook denied all the facts in the case, and that it was not clear to him that the decree covered information transfer practices of apps.  But the FTC--led by the privacy and consumer protection teams--dismissed these arguments. It <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2012/08/statement-federal-trade-commission-matter-facebook-inc">promised</a> close supervision and a willingness to levy penalties.  The Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2012/08/120810facebookcmbltrs.pdf">said</a> it was clear that Facebook would be on the hook for application conduct that contravened Facebook representations.  A Twitter chat led by a senior FTC privacy lawyer, along with responses to public commenters concerned about apps, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/twitter-chats-2010-2011/facebook-twitterchat.pdf">assured the public</a> that app misconduct was the kind of foreseeable risk that Facebook had to address in its privacy program.</p>
<p>But these statements do not have any force of law. Instead, the FTC's ability to fine is tethered to the settlement agreement, particularly to the specific provisions that Facebook <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2012/08/120810facebookdo.pdf">promised</a> not to violate.  Enforcement is not handled by the privacy team, but rather by a different division with expertise in interpreting agreements. Turning to that agreement, advocates of civil penalties against Facebook point to three theories, but none of which is easy to bring.</p>
<p>First, part one of the agreement broadly bans Facebook from misrepresenting how it distributes personal data. Here, the FTC will bear the burden of showing that Facebook's opt-out settings for friends' data transfer to apps were misleading. If this information were particularly sensitive, such as location data, it would be an easy case, but here it was only basic profile information that was subject to opt-out. American law subjects many forms of information to opt-out instead of opt-in standards. For instance, even financial information <a href="https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1636/">can be transferred</a> on an opt-out basis.  Why then would it be misleading for Facebook to make basic profile information subject to the same standard?</p>
<p>Second, part two of the agreement seems to impose a broad, "affirmative prior consent" restriction on transferring user data to third parties. Might Facebook have violated this consent standard in transferring data to developers? Probably not, because Facebook negotiated a special loophole to reserve the ability to create a "retweet" function. The loophole immunizes Facebook from users forwarding on information about other users. Until 2014, Facebook's default settings allowed such transfer to apps, and so the plain wording of loophole seems to eat up the affirmative consent requirement.  </p>
<p>A third avenue for enforcement comes from Facebook's promise to create a comprehensive privacy program and mitigate risks. Here, some argue that Facebook's failure to audit developers was an unreasonable oversight. But it is common practice to entrust other commercial parties with confidential information, subject to contractual promises that data will be deleted. It will be difficult to convince a court that it was "reasonable" for Facebook to impose expensive, time-consuming audits on thousands of developers.</p>
<p>If one of these theories works, imposing civil penalties is still tricky because of how the FTC "counts" violations.  The failure to audit might be counted as a single wrong triggering a five-figure fine. If however the FTC has the will to argue that many millions of people were misled by Facebook's settings, the fine could be ten-figures. </p>
<p>Of course, it would be economically rational for Facebook to litigate against even a seven-figure penalty, which raises yet another FTC pathology: the FTC is a risk-adverse litigator. It wishes not to litigate because cases soak up resources and if the agency loses, bad precedent can harm all the agency's efforts. Thus, the three theories for enforcement must be very strong for the FTC to risk bringing a case.</p>
<p>Facebook's reputation for scorched-earth litigation also adds to the FTC's caution. Consider that in an European proceeding, Facebook sought dismissal of a case because the court failed to follow formal Dutch language requirements. <a href="https://m.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20160127_02093367">How?</a> The court used the English words "browser" and "cookie" instead of the Dutch "internetsnuffelaar" and "koekje zijn."  </p>
<p><strong>Deterring Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Despite these challenges, I am optimistic about the FTC's renewed pursuit against Facebook. The investigation is likely to uncover new, unrelated wrongdoing that will give Facebook strong incentives to agree to broader terms and even pay penalties. But will this deter Facebook from further data depredations? I think the FTC needs to do two things to deter Facebook: first, the FTC must understand and tailor interventions to fit Facebook's psychology, and second, to impose personal liability on Facebook's leaders.</p>
<p>Turning first to Facebook's psychology, in a recent essay, former FTC director of consumer protection and Georgetown Law Professor David Vladeck, <a href="https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/facebook-cambridge-analytica-and-the-regulators-dilemma-clueless-or-venal/">drew a distinction</a> between "clueless" and "venal" respondents. Vladeck implies that Facebook is venal and suggested a series of reforms to rein in Facebook.  Vladeck's critique, insightful and trenchant, however, was misplaced. </p>
<p>Facebook is a founder-controlled company. Its leader is not venal; he is ideological. He simply thinks that privacy is irrelevant in light of the benefits, the powerful learnings that are at hand because of information "flow." This ideology is identified as <a href=http://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/>"dataism"</a> by Yuval Noah Harari,  but to understand its full consequences, one needs to venture into fiction, in books such as Joshua Cohen's Joycean feat, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/240498/book-of-numbers-by-joshua-cohen/9780812986655/"><em>Book of Numbers</em></a>.  Through those lenses, one sees that to a dataist, information flow and sharing are the categorical imperative. They trump enlightenment values surrounding personal autonomy and privacy.</p>
<p>This raises the question--how to deter a founder who simply does not believe in privacy, one who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102276573729791&set=a.529237706231.2034669.4&type=1&theater&_fb_noscript=1">posts an announcement</a> of his wife's miscarriages online with paeans to an "open and connected world?"  The answer is that the FTC has to either get Zuckerberg to sublimate privacy values, or it should craft an intervention that causes him to lose control over his company. </p>
<p>Second, startup companies' leaders frequently face "individual liability" under the FTC Act because in small organizations, executives control so many decisions. If the executive directly participates in a deceptive act, such as approving a fraudulent ad, the executive can be named individually in a suit.  Large companies rarely face such liability, but there is good reason to believe that the FTC can impose individual liability on Zuckerberg and other high-level Facebook executives. Consider Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, who in an internal memo, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data">wrote</a> that "connecting" people was a categorical imperative justifying "[a]ll the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends..."  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/pom_dc_circuit1_0.pdf">FTC could see</a> such exhortations as direct participation in deceptive acts and impose terrifying levels of personal liability on such executives.  The deterrent effect would be both specific and general, and would deny Zuckerberg the ability to continue aggressive privacy invasions, as his lieutenants would fear having a FTC order attach to them personally for 20 years. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Our society has awakened to the reality that privacy isn't just about advertisements. It is about the quality of our information environment, with knock-on effects on autonomy and our republic itself. As a result, the stakes have increased, for Facebook, and for the institutions that police it. I hope these institutions can rise to the challenge, in part because keeping these conflicts in the scope of consumer law has benefits to civil society and expressive freedom. The FTC can deter Facebook's data depredations by crafting interventions focused on its leadership, because of their specific efforts to deny individuals privacy.</p>

<em>"Where will it end? When will it all be lulled back into sleep, and cease, the bloody hatred, the destruction?"</em><br />
-Aeschylus (Oresteia), presenting the ending of Agamemnon<br />
 <br />
 <br />
          <strong>C</strong>urrently, the Korean peninsula, Syria and the wider Middle East are the most critically urgent venues of world legal disorder. To be sure, if we can further accept that we are already enmeshed in "Cold War II," the United States and Russia should reasonably be included in these venues. Still, the core problems of peace and war are not narrowly geographic. Rather, these issues are embedded deeply into our species' time-dishonored commitments to the concept of a national military victory and a literally endless cycle of international belligerence and zero-sum confrontations.<br />
          Where will it all end? To answer such a profoundly far-reaching question, we must first recognize that every seeming military success or victory offers only a temporary reprieve, a more-or-less reassuring holding action. In more expressly jurisprudential terms, this acceptance of a never-ending war suggests that even the most carefully codified treaties of peace are ultimately little more than a flimsy armistice or cease-fire agreement.   This debility refers even more obviously to non-treaty international legal agreements. While US President Donald Trump now thinks seriously about exiting the 2015 <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/245317.pdf]">JCPOA with Iran</a>, there is actually little or no reason to suppose that Tehran's strategic nuclear agenda would be affected or correspondingly altered. And if the JCPOA were somehow "upgraded" to a treaty-based law - an inconceivably optimistic assumption at this late date - the lack of policy consequence for Iran would still remain the same.<br />
          Historically, we may readily conclude and without hesitation that any purported military success or even full-scale victory will meaningfully endure only until the next conflict. While it is not inevitable that all conflicts would necessarily reappear in precisely similar circumstances or between the identical state parties, it is, in fact, incontestable that our overall system of global power management (one "born" at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648) will experience periodic and potentially catastrophic breakdowns.<br />
          In short, even if we should somehow "successfully" manage the stunningly complex crises in Asia, the Middle East, and potentially the United States (think here of a steadily enlarging "Cold War II"), this alleged success will bring few if any real long-term consolations. Accordingly, in all pertinent security matters, the United States ought not to presumptuously declare <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/14/politics/trump-syria-strike/index.html">"mission accomplished,"</a> but plan instead to create a more enduring system of world legal reform.<br />
          It's not just that such a declaration would be premature (the criticism leveled very recently and fairly about President Donald Trump's almost visceral and self-promoting declaration on his Syria bombardments), but that it would be ill-advised even if it were not operationally too soon.<br />
          In the final analysis, what is desperately needed for improved global law enforcement is not just the next national battle plan or more suitably refined "order of battle," but a truly coherent vision for reconceptualizing global power management.<br />
          For certain, any such heady advice will likely be ridiculed and summarily dismissed as utopian; nonetheless, there are various conspicuous domains of human survival concern in which any stubborn commitment to "realism" would represent the most naive posture of all. Accordingly, says famed Italian film director, Federico Fellini, although plainly not speaking specifically about world legal order, "The visionary is the only realist."<br />
          While a filmmaker is not expectedly the optimal source of insight into deeply arcane aspects of global politics, the truth is still always exculpatory, whatever its intellectual origins.  Therefore, Realpolitik or geopolitics has never "succeeded" for more than exceedingly brief historical intervals. Looking ahead, however many defensive first strikes might be launched against assorted presumptively prospective aggressors, and irrespective of any appropriate collective security authorizations, grievous systemic failures could still involve weapons of mass destruction (including even nuclear weapons).<br />
          In these blatantly foreseeable cases, any particular failures of Realpolitik could prove not "only" catastrophic, but also unprecedented - sui generis or unique in the wider lexicon of logic and the scientific method.<br />
          What then? In scientific terms, there could be no authentic way to accurately ascertain true probabilities of plausible follow-on catastrophes. This is because "true probabilities" must always depend upon the determinable frequency of pertinent past events. By irremediable definition, of course, there could be no such "pertinent past events."<br />
          In complete candor, a determinedly zero-sum orientation of world politics has once again become so darkly unpromising and so brutally competitive that it begins to resemble a genuine chaos. It follows, in the shadowy years ahead for world legal affairs, that one thing is plausibly assured. This is that the longstanding Hobbesian universe of a Bellum omnium contra omnes - a war of all against all- cannot be sustained.<br />
          All states, but especially those that rely implicitly or explicitly upon some form of nuclear deterrence, must, therefore, begin to think much more self-consciously about creating improved systems of world law. While any hint of a revealed interest in global unification or integration (or what French Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin calls "planetization") will sound unacceptably fanciful to "realists," it is actually far more realistic to understand a different insight:  <br />
          The still-prevailing "every man for himself" ethos in world politics is time-dishonored and destined to fail.     In the words of the celebrated Jesuit scientist and philosopher in The Phenomenon of Man: "The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of `everyone for himself' is false and against nature. No element could move and grow except with and by all the others with itself."<br />
          Again and again - at some point, perhaps, irretrievably - world systemic failures could become simultaneously intolerable and irreversible. In the final analysis, it will not be enough to merely tinker at the jagged edges of our current world legal order, endlessly forging ad hoc agreements between usually recalcitrant states, or between these states and various surrogate sub-state (sometimes terroristic) organizations: "What is the good," inquires playwright Samuel Beckett in Endgame, "of passing from one untenable position to another, of seeking justification always on the same plane?"<br />
          It's the right query. In the longer term, any long term, the only sort of realism that can make any real sense, the only sort of Beckettian "good," is a stance that points ceaselessly and unhesitatingly toward a far "higher" awareness of global human oneness and world system interdependence.<br />
          Ultimately, in its fully optimized expressions, such an awareness would likely resemble what the ancients had imaginatively called "cosmopolis," or world city. For the moment, incontestably, the prophets of a more integrated and harmonious world civilization will remain few and far between; but this is not on account of any intrinsic lack of need for intellectual "prophecy." Instead, it reflects a progressively imperiled species' stubborn unwillingness to ever take itself seriously -  that is, to recognize that the only sort of common loyalty that can ultimately rescue all states must first embrace a redirected commitment (both individual and national) to humankind in general.<br />
          At its heart, this is not really such a complicated idea. To wit, it is hardly a medical secret that those basic behaviors plainly common to all human beings vastly outnumber those traits that continue to foolishly differentiate us, one from another. Unless the leaders of all major states on Planet Earth can finally understand that the survival of any one state will inevitably be contingent upon the survival of all, true national security will continue to elude absolutely every nation on earth, including the allegedly "most powerful," including even the "superpowers."<br />
           There is one central truth in the study of world politics that is still far from any evident recognition or acknowledgment. It is that our planet represents an indissoluble or organic whole, a fragile but fully-intersecting "unity" that already exhibits steadily disappearing opportunities for human rights and war avoidance.[1]<br />
          To seize these residual opportunities, "visionaries" throughout the world must finally learn to build solidly upon the foundational insights of Francis Bacon, Galileo, and Isaac Newton,[2] and also on the much more recent observation of Lewis Mumford: "Civilization is the never-ending process of creating one world and one humanity."<br />
          As a much-needed bulwark of such a civilization, international law - which is an integral part of the domestic legal system of all states in world politics -   has long assumed a reciprocally common obligation to supply benefits to one another. This core assumption of jurisprudential solidarity is known formally as a "peremptory" or jus cogens expectation, that is, one that is not even subject to question. It can be found already in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis, Hugo Grotius, The Law of War and Peace (1625) and Emmerich de Vattel, The Law of Nations or Principles of Natural Law (1758).<br />
          In the short term, the recent US military strikes against Syria represented a reasonable and permissible instance of law-enforcement within a decentralized or still-anarchic world legal system. (Tactically, however, they will have little bearing upon Bashar al-Assad's capacity to stay in power and to continue with his genocidal regime.) But in the longer term, which is indisputably more important, any such vigilante or "self-help" remedies will need to be supplanted systematically by something far more enduring, that is, by an altogether new and potentially universal global consciousness. While it goes without saying that no one has yet figured out just how to bring about such truly indispensable social transformations, it is similarly obvious that proceeding along the traditional course of corrosive interstate rivalries and war can never succeed.<br />
          "In the end," cautions the classic German poet Goethe, "we must depend upon creatures of our own making."<br />
          In the end, says filmmaker Federico Fellini, "The visionary is the only realist."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><j:header>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href=https://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/facultymember/biography?id=heidi.gilchrist>Heidi Gilchrist</a> of Brooklyn Law School discusses the fundamentality of higher education... </j:header> </p>
<p><strong>A</strong>s high school seniors across the country make their college decisions right now, I would like to raise awareness for higher education as a human right. Many high school graduates will get into the college of their dreams, but their families will be unable to afford to send them there. For many others, even their decisions on where to apply were driven by costs, not wanting to spend the admission fee or considering the fact that they could not afford to go to a particular highly selective institution if they did get in due to exorbitant costs. Worldwide, displaced students from war-torn countries are not getting the education they need to enable them to return to their countries and rebuild or integrate themselves fully into their host countries. Not only is this a crisis on a moral level, it is a crisis from a national security perspective.</p>
<p>Higher education is a human right. Education is recognized as a human right in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>; the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx">Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</a>; and in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. The right to education is also included in other conventions against discrimination. Courts in the European Union have recognized higher education as a human right. While most people around the world now accept that primary education is a human right, many still dismiss higher education as a human right. Yet there is no logical endpoint for education in today's increasingly global and complex society where advanced degrees are often needed to succeed in many fields. I am not arguing that everyone should go to college--only those with capacity and desire. Education is closely tied to human dignity and other human rights - such as the right to vote and freedom of speech. And, in the words of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, "a well-educated, enlightened and active mind, able to wander freely and widely, is one of the joys and rewards of human existence."</p>
<p>Costs at many private universities are now estimated to be between $50,000 and $70,000 a year. However, the median household income in the United States is only $59,039. This is a serious problem. We cannot risk having higher education become a luxury item. It is not.</p>
<p>Without understanding education, including higher education, as a human right, we risk our country losing the very ideal it was founded on--access to the American dream. The reasons many families came to America was because here, unlike anywhere else in the world, if you were smart and capable, you could make it. Your family name or circumstances did not define the outcome of your life. If we lose this, not only do we lose innovators, those who will make advances in many different fields, but we lose our identity as a nation.</p>
<p>And, interestingly, this is a time when national security and human rights go hand-in-hand. We cannot risk a society in which only one group - the wealthy - can afford higher education. We need diverse viewpoints to come up with innovative solutions to countering terrorism at home and abroad. On a global level, as the war in Syria drags on, we cannot risk a "lost generation" of students who do not get the education they need. Syria will need its youth to return, educated, to their country and rebuild it so it does not become another fertile ground for radicalism to take root and grow. For the refugees that stay in their host countries, it will be education that helps integrate them fully into their host countries. The Islamic State and other terror groups have figured out how to use a warped form of education to recruit and brainwash recruits with social media and the internet. It will be education, not bombs, that is most likely to counter their radicalization messages. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-famous-quote-on-education/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.c3f8f6526de5">Nelson Mandela</a> has said, "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."</p>
<p>Access to higher education is vital. Financial aid can only help a limited number of students and loans are extremely burdensome. For a student from a disadvantaged, or even middle-class, background, an economist may tell you college is worth the $240,000 debt, but that number is understandingly daunting to most. And, for many fields, an advanced degree is required so the amount of debt would increase as well. Imagine starting your first job with $400,000 or more in debt. There are some programs in place that are a great start - for example, New York State has a <a href="https://www.ny.gov/programs/tuition-free-degree-program-excelsior-scholarship">program</a> where families making less than $125,000 can attend, tuition-free, any school in the State University or City University of New York system. So, let's recognize higher education as a human right and work to counter the increasing costs of higher education that is leaving too many students behind.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="span12 box">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="https://law.vanderbilt.edu/bio/karla-mckanders">Karla McKanders</a> of the <a href="https://law.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> discusses a recent decision issued by the Attorney General and its implications on the judicial immigration process...</div>
<strong>Y</strong>esterday, in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1022366/download"><em>Matter of Castro-Tum</em></a>, the Attorney General issued a decision unilaterally overturning two precedential immigration decisions; <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3740.pdf"><em>Matter of Avetisyan</em>, 25 I&amp;N Dec. 688 (BIA 2012)</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/958526/download"><em>Matter of W-Y-U-</em>, 27 I&amp;N Dec. 17 (BIA 2017)</a> and "any other Board precedent, to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with this opinion." These precedent decisions grant immigration judges the authority to administratively close cases that are on their docket.

The Attorney General relied on <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1003.1">8 C.F.R § 1003.1(h)(1)(i)</a> to send this case to himself. This rule grants him the authority to overrule or completely rewrite the decisions of an independent tribunal, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is comprised of judges possessing greater subject matter expertise. His decision brings into question fundamental rule of law principles that underlie the American judicial system - judicial independence and adherence to precedent.

In <em>Castro-Tum</em>, Sessions invoked this regulation in the case of a 19-year-old who was not represented by a lawyer at the time where the immigration judge administratively closed his deportation case. Surprisingly, the immigration bar's attempts to locate the 19-year-old to help provide representation have been unsuccessful as the administration has acted under a veil of secrecy regarding persons directly impacted by its decision. Administrative closure is a standard procedure used by immigration judges to manage their dockets and temporarily stop removal proceedings.

Judicial independence to manage their own courtroom and dockets is essential to any court system. This rule should not exclude individual immigration judges who are already overloaded with an average caseload of <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/HRF-Backgrounder-Immigration-Courts.pdf">700 cases per year</a> and on average waiting periods of up to <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/468/">670 days for hearings</a> with a wait time of up to <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/468/">five years for more active immigration court jurisdictions</a>, according to Syracuse University TRAC system which monitors immigration statistics. The <em>Castro - Tum</em> decision strips immigration judges of an essential tool, judicial independence, which is a fundamental principle rule of law.

In the opinion, the Attorney General also states that even though the federal regulations provide immigration judges and the BIA with the authority to issue operational instructions and policy, this regulation does <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/1003.9">extend to an immigration judge's ability</a> to administratively close cases to manage their dockets. Under this decision, the immigration judge is no longer a neutral adjudicator. In <em>Avetisyan</em> the Board of Immigration Appeals, the court most familiar with immigration law procedures and immigration judges' dockets, held that "the party opposing administrative closure has provided a persuasive reason for the case to proceed and be resolved on the merits." In the <em>Castro</em> decision, the Attorney General utilizes the one example in this case where an immigration judge ordered administrative closure or refused to re-calendar an administratively closed case over the DHS trial attorney's objection. The judge and Board's decision is at the heart of judicial independence; judges are to hear arguments on both sides and make a decision whether an individual case warrants a form of relief or procedural remedy. In April of this year, the National Association of Immigration Judges pushed back against Sessions' informal policy changes when he <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/04/02/immigration-judges-memo.pdf">issued a memo</a> providing that in immigration judges' performance evaluations, judges will be required to clear at least 700 cases a year and to have fewer than 15 percent of their decisions overturned on appeal. <a href="https://www.naij-usa.org/images/uploads/publications/DPE%2C_AFL-CIO_-_Letter_Opposing_IJ_Quotas_4-17-18.pdf">The judges warned</a> that the Attorney General's quotas threatened "the professional integrity of the IJs and the political independence of the immigration courts, without actually producing the desired efficiency." Immigration judges have asserted that the Attorney General expects them to process serious cases with a limited budget and staff infamously echoed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/us/09immig.html">Immigration Judge Dana Marks 2010 remarks</a> that "immigration judges often feel asylum hearings are 'like holding death penalty cases in traffic court.'" Even more troubling is the Attorney General's failure to defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals which has expertise in reviewing individual cases.

The reality of the Attorney General's decision is that it will probably send an already backlogged and overworked system of judges into chaos. While the Attorney General proudly asserts that this decision weighs heavily in "strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases," stripping immigration judges of their discretion will not make the backlog go away in immigration court; it will exacerbate an already stressed system. In the jurisdiction where I practice, immigration judges have begun setting place holder dates on their calendars instead of administratively closing cases, contributing to the backlog and wasting court time and resources. Another adverse impact is that overworked immigration judges with large dockets often become exhausted and end up not fully evaluating each case before them in violation of an immigrant's procedural due process rights.

The Attorney General, the highest office of attorney in the country, fails to acknowledge these basic principles upon which our system is based and he eviscerates Board of Immigration Appeals precedent. His actions demonstrate that he, unlike all members of society, including judicial officers, are not subject to laws and processes. His style signals fundamental shortcomings in our legal system, and one can only hope that his unprecedented actions may be moderated by our government's system of checks and balances through judicial review and/or legislative action.

<strong>I</strong>f US President Donald Trump should sometime manage to re-start the cancelled nuclear summit talks with Kim Jung Un, his core focus should be on achieving stable nuclear deterrence, not "denuclearization." In principle, of course, getting Pyongyang to relinquish its nuclear assets (both actual weapons and corresponding infrastructures) would be best, but any such optimal summit result would be inconceivable. Why, after all, would the North Korean leader willingly relinquish his only real source of power and influence, not only with Washington, but with the rest of the world as well?

This brings viable American options back to achieving stable nuclear deterrence with the regime in Pyongyang. Although key elements in creating such a basic condition of mutual safety would necessarily be geopolitical or strategic rather than legal, certain corollary jurisprudential issues would inevitably arise and also demand close attention of the parties. Foremost among these prospectively helpful issues would be the legal obligations and parameters of individual states in our still-decentralized system of international law, a "<a href="http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=3778&amp;language=english">Westphalian</a>" arrangement for managing global power that has endured since 1648, and continues to call for an equilibrium founded upon vigilante dynamics and more-or-less reciprocal threats of retaliatory destruction.

While largely informal and uncodified, this core arrangement nonetheless expects individual states to distinguish between aggression and self-defense, and to abide by all peremptory norms of the law of war, aka humanitarian international law, or the law of armed conflict.

It follows that global power management by arrangement of threats and counter-threats (however time-dishonored and regrettable) would not be "illegal," but all peace and "balance" objectives would still need to be achieved in ways that are recognizably consistent with discrimination (distinction), proportionality and military necessity.

Looking ahead to possible future iterations of the North Korean nuclear threat (whether foreseen or unforeseen), the absence of any centralized global authority need not necessarily indicate the absence of pertinent international law. As every professor of international law routinely instructs students on the first day of each course, this particular normative system of controlling violence and injustice is plainly "unique" (because it is self-help centered, or decentralized), but is nonetheless authoritatively law-making and law-enforcing.

Should Washington and Pyongyang sometime manage to implement a promising and durable system for mutual deterrence, it would likely evolve in a fashion similar to the protracted US-Soviet stand-off during the Cold War. This means that while basic elements of decentralized law enforcement would stem directly from the specific and tangible realities of US-North Korean competitive power relations, these elements might also be strengthened and reinforced by certain appropriate treaties and conventions, not only certain special and new agreements concerning nuclear arms control, but also the entire extant network of fundamental rules and jurisprudential expectations. In this connection, such foundational agreements as the <em><a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/">UN Charter</a></em>; <em><a href="https://www.ilsa.org/jessup/jessup15/Montevideo%20Convention.pdf">Convention on the Rights and Duties of States</a></em>; <em><a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%201155/volume-1155-i-18232-english.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a></em>; <em><a href="http://www.un-documents.net/a25r2625.htm">Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States</a></em>; <em><a href="http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf">International Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility</a></em>; and the <em><a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a></em> come immediately to mind.

Over the years, legal scholars have questioned (quite reasonably) the logic and legality of a nuclear threat system existing within the framework of a UN Charter obligation (<a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/repertoire/principles.shtml#rel2">Article 2/4</a>) to "...refrain from the threat or use of force...," but this codified obligation is expressly linked to those threats that are directed "against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." In other words, at least in a narrowly technical sense, those international threats that are intended only to maintain global peace, security and balance are not ipso facto "wrong," and could conceivably be welcome or even indispensable components of international law enforcement.

For this country, President Donald Trump should be reminded: international law is already part of the domestic law of the United States, and each and every peremptory obligation of the former is clearly incorporated into binding US law. In essence, the bases for any such incorporation can be discovered at <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-9-7.pdf">Article VI </a>of the US Constitution (the "Supremacy Clause"), and at such major US Supreme Court decisions as the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/case.html">Paquete Habana</a> (1900);<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/case.html"> the Lola</a> (1900); and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/517/542/2386834/">Tel Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic</a> (1984). This means, inter alia, that if the US should proceed to disregard various international law expectations in its implementation of stable nuclear deterrence with North Korea, it would automatically be in violation of its own municipal law.

Although obvious enough to legal scholars, this fact is still generally overlooked by certain American politicians who see only bifurcation or dichotomy between US and international law.

There is one more rudimentary aspect of jurisprudential obligation and prospective mutual deterrence between US and North Korean adversaries that warrants present mention. This significant aspect can be found within Emmerich de Vattel's classic text of 1758, <em><a href="http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/vattel-the-law-of-nations-lf-ed">The Law of Nations, or the Principles of Natural Law</a></em>. According to this seminal Swiss scholar, "The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement of other Nations." To be sure, though there is little in human history that would suggest any discoverable optimism about this peremptory principle of law and justice, it still remains an incontestable and commendable legal goal for all states, including, of course, both North Korea and the United States.              

Ultimately, for Pyongyang and Washington, any future negotiations must be soundly based upon solid intellectual as well as jurisprudential foundations. During these expected exercises in diplomacy, each side, at least as long as it remains recognizably rational, will be seeking certain viable forms of "escalation dominance." Accordingly, North Korea and the United States will each expectedly strive for this objective without needlessly endangering its own prospects for achieving enhanced national security via stable nuclear deterrence.

Always, in such matters, judgments of enemy rationality will be critical. For example, if the American side should sometime calculate that its North Korean counterpart is not fully rational, various latent incentives to undertake an American military preemption could then become more urgent. This is the case, moreover, even if the anticipated costs of any such defensive first-strike would seem to be overwhelming.

A U.S. preemption against North Korean hard targets might be able to qualify in apt legal terms as "anticipatory self-defense;" but it could come at an unreasonably high human cost. What, after all, would it really mean to act legally at the expense of grievously high fatalities? Of what conceivable authentic benefit could it be for the United States to claim that its defensive first strike was fully permissible, and only then to suffer enormously destructive and distressingly palpable enemy retaliations?

Principal alignments will also "count." In creating a stable nuclear deterrence regime between Washington and Pyongyang, US President Donald Trump would need to take into consideration the presumptive expectations of both Moscow and Beijing. Should this deterrence regime ever be allowed to falter or fail, and should U.S. President Donald Trump sometime still decide to undertake certain selective military actions against North Korea, the general contours of Kim Jung Un's response would need to be anticipated.

Accordingly, Pyongyang, having no conceivably logical alternative to launching several possible forms of armed reprisal, could choose to strike (a) the American homeland; (b) American military forces in the region, and/or (c) assorted other targets in Guam, Japan, or South Korea.

Whatever North Korea's preferred configuration of selected targets, Kim Jung Un's retaliatory blow would likely be designed so as not to elicit any unacceptably massive (possibly even nuclear) American counter-retaliations. But any such carefully-reasoned conclusion by President Kim would depend, inter alia, upon (1) the Korean dictator's own willing adherence to rational decision-making; and (2) the largely unpredictable synergies between Kim's determined level of rationality and the reciprocally rational calculations of President Donald Trump. By definition, such synergies could produce assorted instability outcomes that are substantially more insidious than merely the additive sum of their respective "parts."

If  President Trump should ever decide to launch a conventional preemption, that is, a non-nuclear defensive first-strike, the North Korean response, whether rational or irrational, could be "disproportionate." In that potentially chaotic case, one fraught with literally unprecedented potential for additional or accelerating competitions in risk-taking, the introduction of nuclear weapons into an already-volatile mix might not be discounted. If, on the other hand, President Donald Trump's defensive first strike against North Korea were non-nuclear and tangibly less than massive, a rational adversary in Pyongyang might then determine that its chosen reprisal should be correspondingly "limited."

If Mr. Trump's consciously rational and systematically calibrated attack upon North Korea were wittingly or unwittingly launched against an irrational enemy leadership, the expected response from Kim Jung Un could still be some form or other of all out retaliation. Plausibly, any such North Korean response, whether nuclear or non-nuclear, would be directed at some as yet undeterminable combination of US, South Korean, and/or Japanese targets.

Even if it is being played by only rational adversaries, any advancing strategic "game" between Washington and Pyongyang would demand each player to strive relentlessly for "escalation dominance." It would be in the manifestly unpracticed dynamics of such a perilous rivalry that the dire prospect of mutual catastrophe could rapidly emerge. Logically, at least, this mutually unwanted outcome could be produced in more-or-less unexpected increments of escalation by one or both of the two national players, or by any sudden quantum leap in destructiveness undertaken by North Korea and/or the United States.

Obviously, these are serious and challenging intellectual problems. It's all bewilderingly complex, and foreseeably unprecedented. It follows, in facing off against each other for "escalation dominance," and even under the most reassuring assumptions of bilateral rationality, both President Donald Trump and President Kim Jung Un would have to prepare themselves for endlessly possible miscalculations, errors in information, unauthorized uses of strategic weapons, mechanical or computer malfunctions, and literally measureless nuances of cyber-defense/cyber-war.

Should President Trump ever decide to strike North Korea preemptively, he would then need to be reminded of the classic warning offered by Carl von Clausewitz. Long before military planners could ever even have imagined a nuclear war, the insightful Prussian general and strategist had cautioned leaders in <em><a href="http://www.fullbooks.com/On-War.html">On War</a></em> about "friction" or "the difference between war on paper, and war as it actually is." Accordingly, nuclear brinksmanship between Washington and Pyongyang would necessarily take place in frightfully uncharted waters, and would require both presidents to steer a consistently steady course between escalation dominance and national survival.

Kim Jung Un will never accept US President Donald Trump's favored definition of "denuclearization," that is, unilateral nuclear disarmament by North Korea. This conclusion obtains even if the American president should indicate a corresponding willingness to denuclearize the entire Korean peninsula. It follows that Mr. Trump's most ambitious diplomatic objective should be the creation of stable nuclear deterrence "regime" between Washington and Pyongyang. Although less satisfying than the more fanciful idea of getting rid of North Korean nuclear assets, such a security regime remains America's best available strategic option for dealing with northeast Asia. This deterrence regime could be erected upon foundations that are not only secure and promising in specifically operational terms, but are also both legal and law-enforcing. Indeed, by maintaining a proper jurisprudential focus in creating stable nuclear deterrence between Washington and Pyongyang, both national "players" would thereby enhance the operation of a sorely needed long-term arrangement for managing power in the unsteady region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I</strong>n January 2018, the French Parliament formalized - as part of the 2018 Finance Act -<span> </span><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036339197">several tax changes</a> likely to impact companies including the repeal of the 3% additional tax on redistributions from the French Tax Code. This suppression, estimated to cost €9bn to the Government in claims for reimbursements, follows rulings asserting its contrariety with both the E.U. Parent-Subsidiaries Directive (PSD) and the French Constitution and highlights the phenomenon of Europeanization of national law.

Introduced in the French Tax Code in 2012,<span> </span><a href="httphttps://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000026291756&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069577">the 3% tax on the distribution of dividends</a><span> </span>is levied on French entities subject to corporate income tax (including French permanent establishments of foreign companies), redistributing profits received - inter alia- from their subsidiaries. Its purpose, beyond budgetary concerns, is to deter companies from distributing dividends to their shareholders and to induce them to reinvest their profits back into their businesses. From the outset, an intense debate has surrounded the tax's implementation and particularly its compliance with the PSD.

Established in 1990 to facilitate E.U. cooperation, the PSD was designed to address tax complications in the context of distributions between a parent company and a subsidiary, located in different EU Member states. In particular, article 4(1) of the directive provides that where a parent company receives distributed profits from its European subsidiaries, the Member State of the parent company shall either refrain from taxing such profits or tax such profits while authorizing the parent company to deduct from the amount of tax due the amount paid by the subsidiary. France has opted for<span> </span><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006303504&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069577">a system of exemption of the dividends paid by subsidiary companies to their parents' companies</a>.

E.U. law's main impact was triggered by the CJEU's preliminary ruling as to the 3% Tax's conformity with the PSD. Member States are constrained by the decisions of the CJEU, which is required to ensure that national legislation comply with E.U. law and judgments of the CJEU. Specifically, preliminary rulings are a key element of European law supremacy and highlight Member States' deference to the European judge in construing E.U law. In 2016, the main professional organization representing large French listed companies (AFEP) filed a lawsuit against the French Minister of Finance and Public Accounts challenging the legality of the tax's administrative guidelines as infringing the PDS. On June 27th, 2016, France's highest Administrative Court, having serious doubts as to the conformity of the 3% Tax with the PSD,<span> </span><a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/CE-27-juin-2016-Association-francaise-des-entreprises-privees">referred the matter to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling</a>.

The CJEU was asked whether Article 4 of the PSD must be interpreted as precluding the levy of a tax against a parent company's distribution of dividends, which includes profits coming from that company's subsidiaries established in other Member States. On May 17th, 2017,<span> </span><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A62016CN0365">the CJEU ruled</a><span> </span>that dividends distributed by a French parent company including amounts that the company had previously received from its E.U. subsidiaries, cannot be subject to the 3% Tax on profit distributions, as this would be equivalent to a deferred taxation of such dividends. The court held, that regardless of whether the taxable event is the receipt of the profits by the Parent company or the subsequent redistribution, subjecting such dividends to the 3% Tax would be a form of a double taxation prohibited by PSD.

Bound by the CJEU's preliminary ruling, the Conseil d'Etat yielded to the CJEU's interpretation of the 3% Tax and emphasized its limited scope of application. It held that the CJUE's preliminary ruling solely encompasses redistributions expressly addressed by the PSD. It, however, stated that taxation is not precluded when such dividends are received from domestic or non-E.U. based subsidiaries.

Arguing that the Conseil d'Etat's ruling resulted in discrimination among taxpayers depending on the source of the profits distributed to shareholders, the constitutionality of the tax was challenged before the French Constitutional Council (Conseil Constitutionnel). In particular, it was alleged that the discrimination constituted reverse discrimination, which violates the principle of equality in terms of public burdens guaranteed by the<span> </span><a href="http://www.declarationproject.org/?p=473">French Constitution</a>.

<a href="http://old.jurist.org/forum/2018/05/D%C3%A9cision%20n%C2%B0%202017-660%20QPC%20du%206%20octobre%202017.">The Conseil Constitutionnel, on October 6th, 2017, held</a><span> </span>that by introducing different categories of treatment, based on the source of the redistributions, the 3% Tax violates the constitutional principles of equality before the law and equality in the context of public expenditure. In reaching its decision, the Conseil Constitutionnel relied on the intent of the law, which was to provide significant tax revenue, regardless of the origin of the distributed income. Following its ruling, the 3%<span> </span><a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2017/12/30/CPAX1723900L/jo/texte/fr">Tax was officially abolished in January 2018</a><span> </span>as part of the 2018 Finance Act and two temporary taxes were introduced to finance the reimbursement of the 3% Tax refund claims filed by taxpayers.

This decision is noteworthy in two respects. First, it underlines the intermingling of both legal orders as, by holding that the tax breached the equality principle - which commands to treat likes alike- the Conseil Constitutionel explicitly acknowledged that E.U and domestic situations must be deemed similar. Second, it highlights the emergence of a growing phenomenon of harmonization as between domestic and European legal situations for equality purposes. It appears that, upon the recognition of evident discrimination and absent any specific intent of the lawmaker as to a voluntary differing treatment, France's domestic law should be in line with E.U. law.

To conclude, European law's impact on Member States' legal systems can be assessed in two respects: a quantitative impact that manifests itself in the increased number of E.U. directives that need to be transposed; and a qualitative impact that is seen in how E.U. law trickles into domestic legislation. The twists and turns of the French 3% Tax illustrate how E.U. law can trigger significant changes in a Member State's national legal system. Following the CJEU's decision, not only did the French legislature need to rethink its tax regime to comply with E.U law, but ultimately had to remove it completely from its legislation in the name of equality. In this specific case, the E.U. has been influential in shaping French legislation. Whether this influence benefits Member States or not is a different question. Yet, this decision has been welcomed by French companies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>Nullum crimen sine poena</em>,  "No crime without a punishment."</p>
<p style="text-align: right">- Nuremberg Tribunal, Final Judgment, 1946</p>
<strong>W</strong>hether formally codified or merely personal, memory must always lie at the heart of justice. Today, however, almost no one remembers the myriad threats and actual missile attacks once launched at Israel from Iraq. Indeed, virtually no one even remembers Saddam Hussein, or has any recollection of the Iraqi dictator's subsequent trial and punishment. Significantly, though not even a minor factor in his indictment after capture by U.S. forces on December 13, 2003, Saddam's multiple and overlapping crimes had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_4588000/4588486.stm">included</a> 39 rocket attacks on Israeli cities.
Earlier, perhaps as a long-forgotten precursor (premonition?) of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, Saddam <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-21814734">used</a> devastating chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurds and others with de facto impunity.

In any event, Israel was kept entirely out of the prosecutorial "loop." More precisely, the Jewish State was never offered any marginal voice in the specially created <a href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/iraq1005/3.htm">Iraqi Special Tribunal</a>. Instead, all prosecutorial authority over Saddam was quickly and firmly vested in an <em>ad hoc</em> municipal institution, a newly-synthesized court of justice from which Israel had intentionally and very specifically been excluded. At the time, the U.S. decided not to try Saddam in an American military tribunal, for fear of eliciting further Arab terrorism, and because Washington did not want to give the Iraqi dictator a viable pretext for claiming "Head of State immunity."

The Iraqi Special Tribunal began its proceedings on October 19, 2005. At the end, of course, taking a conclusive page from the precedent-setting Nuremberg judgments rendered after World War II, Saddam Hussein was executed by hanging. The gallows date was set for December 30, 2006.

Still missing from Saddam’s criminal prosecution was even a single count for Iraq’s manifold 1991 aggression against Israel. Nonetheless, Jerusalem had a "peremptory" or incontestable right to participate in this important post-Nuremberg Tribunal. By any reasonable measure, Israel's deliberate exclusion from the IST proceedings effectively violated one of the world's most elementary legal principles of judicial jurisdiction. After all, the substantial crimes committed against Israel had taken place with that state as the only selected target, and on Israel's own lands. Here, therefore, was no need for Jerusalem to make any conspicuous case for "universal jurisdiction," a case it had made earlier for Adolf <a href="https://interactive.wttw.com/playlist/2017/03/27/universal-jurisdiction-over-genocide-trial-adolf-eichmann">Eichmann</a>.

<em>Nullum crimen sine poena </em>or "No crime without a punishment" stems from at least three separate passages of the Torah (in their sequence of probable antiquity, they are Exod. 21:22-25; Deut. 19: 19-21; and Lev. 24: 17-21), the Lex Talionis or "law of exact retaliation" was integral to the Nuremberg Trial and its various specialized successor tribunals. In 1946, when the Special Military Tribunal justified a portion of its sentencing on long-standing arguments for retributive justice, it strongly reaffirmed this binding principle. Its exact words were: "Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore, and liable to punishment."

When facing the Iraqi Special Tribunal, Saddam was charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, but not with aggression against Israel. Yet, aggression is plainly codified in several fully authoritative legal sources, and as an especially serious crime that must never be accepted "without a punishment." The Tribunal's exact words were: "So far from it being unjust to punish him, it would be unjust if his wrongs were allowed to go unpunished."

Whatever the practical arguments at the time might have been for excluding Israel, and there were certainly more than a few of those, there could never have been any correct legal justification for totally ignoring Iraq's Gulf War missile attacks upon innocent Israeli civilian populations. In compliance with both U.S. and allied geopolitical expectations, Israel never fired back. Needless to say, the right to launch an Israeli retaliation in self-defense - subject, of course, to usual limitations of humanitarian international law, namely discrimination (sometimes called distinction), proportionality, and military necessity - would have been beyond all legal question.

Iraq's thirty-nine Scuds killed only one Israeli directly. Twelve additional deaths were the indirect result of these missile attacks. Nearly two-hundred persons were injured; 4393 buildings were damaged. This included 3991 apartments and residential buildings; 331 public institutions; 17 educational institutions; and 54 businesses.
Yes, it could have been much worse. But the obvious tactical failures of Iraq's primitive weapons did not, in themselves, provide an exculpatory legal argument for Saddam. In all such critical legal matters, guilt or criminal responsibility is established primarily by criminal intent and not narrowly by operational outcome.

Although Saddam Hussein's own personal responsibility for aggression against Israel was limited to the 1991 attacks, Iraq had previously amassed a long history of unpunished crimes against the beleaguered country, including barbarous <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-1969-nine-jewish-spies-are-hanged-in-baghdad-1.5315484">public executions</a> of leaders of the Iraqi Jewish community. These barbarous hangings were then justified by Baghdad on the basis of fully concocted charges that, seemingly by definition, all Iraqi Jews were spies for Israel. Also worth noting is that Iraq had sent expeditionary forces against Israel during the 1948 War of Independence, the Six Day War (1967), and even the Yom Kippur War (1973).

During the 1948 conflict, which all of the Arab armies had openly regarded and proclaimed as a purifying war of "annihilation," Iraqi forces entered Transjordan, thereby engaging greatly outnumbered Israeli forces in Western Samaria.

After the 1967 war, Iraqi forces, deployed in Jordan, remained purposely pre-positioned for several years. During the 1973 war, Iraq committed an entire one-third of its then 95,000 man armed forces to assist Hafez al-Assad's Syria, in its campaign of violence against Israel, on the Golan Heights. Since then, as is well-known today, Bashar, the son, has gone beyond both his father and Saddam in the willful gassing of his own countrymen.

International law is not a suicide pact, not then and not now. Accordingly, every state maintains an "inherent" right of self-defense. Participating in the prosecution of Saddam Hussein for prior aggression against Israel would have represented a manifestly authoritative expression of that basic right. In the absence of such participation, the stage was set for yet another Arab jurisprudential assault upon Israel - this time, in the form of yet another enemy state. This new enemy state would be called "Palestine."

There is more. According to Emmerich de Vattel's classic 1758 work on The Law of Nations, a text that influenced the legal thinking of Thomas Jefferson in America, "The right to punish injustice is derived from the right of self-protection." The core right of self-defense in international law is itself drawn from Natural Law or Higher Law, and can never be subordinated to any "man-made" international agreements, or to any extra-legal considerations of power politics.

All things considered, not only did Israel have an unquestioned right to join in the trial of Saddam Hussein, there had also been a corresponding obligation of all other cooperating states to actively ensure such participation. As Blackstone observed, international law exists to provide "for the eternal and immutable laws of good and evil." Each state, Blackstone had then warned, is bound "to aid and enforce the law of nations, as part of the common law, by inflicting an adequate punishment upon offenses against the universal law...."

Natural Law, which is the indisputable basis of all consequent international law, stems originally from the Decalogue (Ten Commandments), and from the Covenant Code of Israel. This Natural Law is expressed not only in the Declaration of Independence, but also in the Bill of Rights. The Ninth Amendment, in stipulating that "the enumeration of certain rights in this Constitution shall not prejudice other rights not so enumerated," reflects an utterly immutable belief in a Higher Law, one that is always superior to the inherently flawed will of human governance.

Looking back, following fully appropriate legal procedure, Israel ought to have been encouraged to prepare a formal criminal complaint against Saddam Hussein for pertinent crimes, and then to file relevant documents with the Iraqi Special Tribunal. Jerusalem's next step should have been in the United Nations. There, in the General Assembly, Israel could have usefully called upon that body to promptly request an Advisory Opinion on the relevant Israeli charges from the International Court of Justice. This retrospective point of justice is important today, not because anything is left to do with regard to earlier Iraqi crimes against Israel, but because of what it implies concerning still-impending Palestinian crimes against the Jewish State.

In this connection, the most evident expected crime has to do with Palestinian plans for a "One State Solution," plans that are unambiguously expressed in the official maps of all major Palestinian insurgent organizations. On all of these maps, the State of Israel is identified as "Occupied Palestine." Taken together with the fact that the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Palestine-Liberation-Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) was founded in 1964, three years before there were any "Occupied Territories," this identification makes very clear that the Palestinian side in any "peace process" is seeking much more than coexistence. It is seeking replacement.

In essence, in spite of still-popular rhetoric calling for a "Two State Solution," there is literally nothing in the charters or derivative codes of Fatah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad that could allow for a surviving Jewish state anywhere in the Dar al-Islam.

In essence, these charters and maps already call for at least a cartographic genocide.

In the earlier matter of Israel and Saddam Hussein, an Advisory Opinion could have been requested by the United States in the Security Council. This American action to render pertinent assistance to Israel would have derived not only from the Constitutional incorporation of international law into United States law, especially <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article 6</a> of the US Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), but also from the indisputably Natural Law foundations of U.S. law. In a now irreversibly lost opportunity, any U.S. initiative to punish Saddam Hussein's crime of aggression against Israel would have represented essential support for both international criminal law and for America's own most durably sacred principles of international justice.

Now, at another perilous moment when Israel’s basic rights under international law are being expressly disregarded, and once again in the United Nations (which several years ago <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2012/ga11317.doc.htm">declared</a> the Palestinian Authority a "nonmember observer state"), it is sobering to remember that Jerusalem has been down this road before. This time, however, even with very explicit "guidance" from the so-called Road Map or whatever the most current iteration of a "Middle East Peace Process," the consequences of global legal indifference could become substantially more serious. This time, especially if Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should bring his claim to sovereign statehood for U.N. endorsement, a potentially-annihilationist "One State Solution" could eventually be the outcome.

This could be the case, moreover, even though "Palestine" would still not have met any of the core expectations for sovereignty expressly identified in the Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, sometimes called the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/intam03.asp">Montevideo Convention</a> (1934).

It would be in the alleged interests of "self-determination," in principle, always a respectable and peremptory legal objective, that any new Arab state be required to "coexist with Israel." Almost certainly, however, this 23rd Arab state, plausibly infused with various encouraging memories of Iraq's earlier unpunished Nuremberg-category crimes against Israel, would diligently plan to remove and replace the pre-existing Jewish State. In any such expectedly proposed "final solution" for Arab-Israeli conflict, the immutable obligations of memory to justice would once again have been trampled upon or ignored.

None of this is meant to suggest that the fundamental human rights of any Palestinian populations should be purposely overlooked or disregarded, but only that these rights must necessarily stop short of Israel's corresponding or reciprocal extinction. To be sure, any such suggestion of genuine coexistence is altogether reasonable and beyond legal question.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a recent opinion on March 15, 2018, the Pennsylvania Superior Court issued a statement about the use of social media evidence in court cases. The relevant case, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7185035856109305144&amp;q=Commonwealth+v.+Mangel&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><u>Commonwealth v. Mangel</u></a>, was a criminal case; however, the implications can be applied to civil cases related to personal injury as well. In fact, many courts and state legislatures are addressing the use of social media evidence in court.

On a typical day, the average person might not consider their Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter privacy settings. Yet, the days following an accident in which someone is injured are hardly typical. The privacy on their social medial profiles may become important because it’s becoming increasingly common for personal injury defendants to use social media evidence in Illinois courts to deny or limit their liability. In most cases, social media evidence is allowed. However, there are ways for plaintiffs in personal injury cases to fight back and attempt to limit the social media evidence used against them.

<strong>What Happened in <u>Commonwealth v. Mangel?</u></strong>

In <u>Mangel</u>, a three-judge panel for the Pennslyvania Superior Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the trial court which denied a criminal prosecutor’s motion in limine to introduce evidence from social media allegedly authored by the defendant, Tyler Mangel. The judges opined that the information identifying the defendant was not enough to allow the Facebook posts as evidence. Senior Judge John L. Musmanno stated that it is too easy to falsify accounts and posts on social media. There is a high standard of authentication for social media evidence.

The evidence prosecutors attempted to submit involved a picture of bloody hands posted to Facebook and sent through mobile chat messages. They alleged that Mangel, who was charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, and harassment, had authored those posts and sent those messages.

Anyone wishing to use social media evidence in a case must present direct or circumstantial evidence that corroborates the identity of the author. Testimony from the person who sent or received communication would be acceptable. Contextual clues would also be relevant. In Mangel’s case, the Erie County Detective testified that she could not say with a reasonable degree of computer and scientific certainty that Mangel had authored the posts and messages. In response, the court denied admission of the evidence.

Mangel’s case required a degree of certainty that the social media evidence being submitted was authored by the defendant. This would apply to any cases where social media evidence is being admitted. Although each state may apply its own test, the requirement to authenticate posts and messages is uniform.

<strong>Personal Injury Defendants’ Use of Social Medical Evidence</strong>

Following an accident, an injured party may post about what happened and their injuries on their social media accounts. This is often the fastest way to update family members and friends living cross the country and world. It seems convenient and harmless. However, an injured party’s updates may become a problem when their social media posts provide insight into their physical and psychological condition.

Content regarding their injuries, medical treatment, abili-ties, pain, and activities may be used against them in court. The defendant may seek to admit into court the plaintiff’s photos, videos, snaps, statuses, comments, and more to prove:

• The plaintiff is not suffering from certain injuries they claim in the lawsuit,
• The plaintiff’s injuries are not as serious as they claim, and/or
• The plaintiff’s life and wellbeing have not been as negatively affected by the injuries as they assert.

<strong>How the Stored Communications Act Impacts Social Media Evidence</strong>

The Stored Communications Act (SCA), 18 USC Sec. 2707-2711, is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, enacted in 1986. The goal of Congress with the SCA was to address the fact that “the Internet presented a host of potential privacy breaches that the Fourth Amendment does not address.” Primarily, the law addresses situations in which electronic data service and storage providers may disclose customers’ data. It presents a personal right or privilege to internet users regarding stored emails and other electronically stored data. Facebook, Instagram, and others do qualify as electronic communications service providers, as they enable users to send or receive wire or electronic communications. The SCA basically addresses when these social media companies may disclose personal data that is stored on their websites.

A person typically has no recourse against a subpoena for information in a personal injury case unless it violates a personal right or privilege. However, under the SCA, a person does have a right or privilege to certain stored information on social media sites. In most court cases, the courts have held that internet service providers and social media websites should not produce posts and other electronic data in response to a civil subpoena, which would be produced in an personal injury case.

However, such a subpoena may be honored under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 34. Rule 34 addresses requests for production of documents, electronically stored information, tangible things, and more. The plaintiff may object to such a request, but many courts have found that relevant requests are valid. Rule 34 also generally permits requests for other personal information, such as bank account documents, school records, and more.

<strong>Challenging Social Media Evidence</strong>

No aspect of social media content makes it inherently inadmissible in court. Electronic information is generally admissible unless it does not meet all of the requirements stated within the Rules of Evidence.

The defendant in a personal injury case may use social media content as evidence if such content is relevant; the content’s probative value is not outweighed by unfair prejudice, confusion, or undue delay; the content can be authenticated; the content is not hearsay; the content either is not a duplicate or falls into an exception under the Best Evidence Rule; and the content was obtained lawfully.

When the defendant in a personal injury matter wishes to put forth social media evidence to deny their liability or to reduce the plaintiff’s financial recovery, there are many potential ways to fight for the evidence to be excluded. The plaintiff’s lawyer may argue it was obtained illegally or does not fulfill one or more evidentiary rules. A common defense is based on authentication.

Courts across the country have grappled with the issue of how social media evidence should be authenticated. Various courts have come to different conclusions. The National Attorneys General Training &amp; Research Institute (NAGTRI) reported three standards have been applied across the nation. How a plaintiff’s attorney argues against the admittance of social media evidence depends on how the jurisdiction requires social medial content to be authenticated.

Writing for NAGTRI, John T. Lee, Senior Assistant Attorney General, and Kevin E. McReynolds, Assistant Attorney General, both of the Colorado Attorney General’s Office, found the three <a href="http://www.naag.org/publications/nagtri-journal/volume-2-issue-2/status-update-on-authenticating-social-media-evidence-the-three-primary-approaches-applied-nationally.php">social media authentication standards</a> as of 2017 were:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
 	<li><em>The Reasonable Juror Standard</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
A majority of courts have decided social media content does not require an authentication standard beyond what would be used for traditional “hard copy” evidence. A party only has to present enough evidence to enable a reasonable juror to conclude the evidence is what the party claims it to be. This is also known as the “Texas standard” since it was outlined in <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/intxco20120208651"><u>Tiende v. State of Texas</u></a> (2012), however it has been discussed and applied in many courts.
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
 	<li><em>The Reasonable Juror-Plus Standard</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Lee and McReynolds determined several courts around the U.S. have used a standard slightly higher than the reasonable juror. In addition to baseline circumstantial evidence proving the evidence is what the party says it is, a court may require a little more. The court may expect additional evidence corroborating that the social media evidence is genuine.

Illinois specifically addressed the issue of social media authentication in <a href="http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/OPINIONS/AppellateCourt/2017/2ndDistrict/2140917.pdf"><u>People of Illinois v. Kent</u></a> in June 2017. The Illinois Appellate Court stated that for a party to authenticate a Facebook post, it must provide evidence sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to find the evidence is what the party claims it to be.

For Illinois personal injury attorneys, the Reasonable Juror Standard is a relatively low bar, potentially making it tough to challenge the admittance of social media evidence. This court decision increases the importance of attorneys advising their clients on how to use—and not use—social media after an accident.
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
 	<li><em>The Exclusionary Fact Standard</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
This is the highest bar for social media authentication, and it was first solidified by the Maryland Supreme Court in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2553774/griffin-v-state/"><u>Griffin v. State of Maryland</u></a> (2011). The court determined evidence from a social networking site required a greater degree of authentication. The court insisted the party prove no one else was the author of the content.

<strong>Social Media Evidence Should Be Scrutinized</strong>

In personal injury cases, social media evidence should be heavily scrutinized. Like the Pennsylvania Superior Court mentioned this year, it is easy to falsify such evidence. It is important to work with experts who can validate posts and messages that originate on social media accounts. If there is any question about the authorship, that evidence should be excluded.

While Congress put limits on electronic data sharing with the SCA, Rules of Evidence do allow revelation of social media posts that are relevant and authentic. This may be detrimental to either side in a personal injury case. Attorneys and their clients should carefully monitor their accounts to ensure privacy is maintained.

On May 8, 2018,  the United States president announced that the U.S. was ceasing its participation in the <span><a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2231(2015)">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ("JCPOA")</a></span> and reinstating sanctions lifted through the JCPOA  basis of a wind-down mechanism. Under the instruction of a President Memorandum, the Department of the Treasury, in particular, has taken some steps to re-impose the sanctions lifted.

On May 15, 2018 during a press conference following a session held with Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Iran, the <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/44599/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-press-conference-following-ministerial-meetings-eue3-and-eue3-and-iran_en">High Representa</a><a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/44599/remarks-hrvp-mogherini-press-conference-following-ministerial-meetings-eue3-and-eue3-and-iran_en">tive of the EU </a>stated that “[w]e recalled our commitment to the continued, full and effective implementation of the Iran nuclear deal that was unanimously endorsed by the UN Security Council Resolution 2231, as a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture and a significant diplomatic achievement.” <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/world-leaders-react-withdrawal-iranian-nuclear-deal-180508184130931.html">China and Russia</a>, as well as otherparticipants of the JCPOA, had a similar reaction to the US withdrawal. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-iran-nuclear-deal-reaction-20180508-story.html">Iran</a> has stated that it will continue to perform its commitments, while at the same time it is ready to resume its suspended enrichment activities.

There are many questions raised by the US' withdrawal from the JCPOA. For example, and most importantly,  the US has disregarded the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as the main monitoring body of the JCPOA. The<span><a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/2231/iaea-reports.shtml"> last 10 IAEA reports</a></span> indicate Iran has not diverted from JCPOA commitments. Moreover, the US has implicitly, if not explicitly, breached some provisions of Resolution 2231 such as in paragraphs 2 and 10. However, this piece intends to focus on the problems with US' current position regarding JCPOA and Resolution 2231. Furthermore this piece will contemplate possible consequences for the US.

The first question is that whether the US currently is a party to the JCPOA. There is no explicit provision in the documents dealing with the issue. In the <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ceasing-u-s-participation-jcpoa-taking-additional-action-counter-irans-malign-influence-deny-iran-paths-nuclear-weapon/">Presidential Memoranda</a></span> issued by White House the US president states that “[t]he Secretary of State shall, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Energy, take all appropriate steps to cease the participation of the United States in the JCPOA.” In this sentence, <em>taking all appropriate steps to cease the participation </em>may connote that the US has not immediately withdrawn from the JCPOA and this needs to go through a process that requires taking some political and economic steps by Department of State and by Department of Treasury during the wind-down period. As a matter of law, it seems that the US has formally withdrawn from the JCPOA by the declaration made by the president of the US as a unilateral act of a State and therefore, has waived its right to put the matter in the JCPOA’s disputes settlement mechanism as a last resort for a JCPOA participant.

The second question is that whether the US can invoke the so-called snapback mechanism provided in paragraph 11 of the Resolution 2231. The paragraph states Security Council (SC) “[<em>D]ecides</em>, acting under Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations, that, within 30 days of receiving a notification by a JCPOA participant State of an issue that the JCPOA participant State believes constitutes significant non-performance of commitments under the JCPOA, it shall vote on a draft resolution to continue in effect the terminations in paragraph 7 (a) of this resolution [regarding sanctions imposed in previous resolutions]…”. According to the paragraph, it seems it is adequate for <em>a JCPOA participant State to believe that an issue</em> <em>constitutes significant non-performance of commitments under the JCPOA. </em>Now the question is whether the US is <em>a JCPOA participant State </em>after May 8. As addressed above, on the one hand, the US has announced formally, unilaterally his withdrawal from JCPOA on May 8. On the other hand, paragraph 11 of the Resolution 2231 should be read in conjunction with paragraph 37 of JCPOA. It states “[U]pon receipt of the notification from the complaining participant, as described above, <em>including a description of the good-faith efforts the participant made to exhaust the dispute resolution process specified in this JCPOA</em>, the UN Security Council, in accordance with its procedures, shall vote on a resolution to continue the sanctions lifting…” As the italic part of the paragraph shows properly, invoking the snapback provided for in paragraph 11 of the Resolution 2231 is subject to some preconditions. It is worthy to note that JCPOA is incorporated into resolution as Annex A and therefore, should be an indispensable part of it. This point is reinforced when one takes into account that the subject-matter of the resolution is JCPOA and SC refers to in paragraph 1 the endorsement of the JCPOA. The preconditions in paragraph 37 of JCPOA refer to the notification by a complaining participant that will address to the SC for re-imposition of the lifted sanctions. This notification must exhaust previously <em>the</em> <em>dispute resolution process specified in this JCPOA. </em>Moreover, this exhausting process must be made within<em> good-faith efforts. </em>As a matter of fact, the US has neither resorted to <em>dispute resolution process specified in this JCPOA</em> yet nor taken any efforts in good faith. On the other hand, withdrawing from JCPOA may be assessed as a bad-faith effort on the part of the US government which, as rightly stated by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/europe-iran-deal/558800/"><span>some scholars</span></a>, denies him from invoking to snapback mechanism in Resolution 2231.

The last but not least, the US reinstating sanction is in contradiction with paragraph 14 of the resolution which states contracts between any party and Iran or Iranian individuals and entities before re-imposition of the lifted sanction under snapback mechanism is valid. After the conclusion of JCPOA on July 14, 2015, Iran engaged in some major contracts with big corporations such as Boeing, Airbus, and Total. If the US actually re-impose nuclear-related sanctions, it will be the breach of paragraph 14 of resolution <em>a fortiori</em>. Moreover, some of the JCPOA provisions will breach by the US reinstating sanction, for example, paragraph 22 of preamble which states “the United States will, as specified in Annex II and in accordance with Annex V, <em>allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran; license non-U.S. persons that are owned or controlled by a U.S. person to engage in activities with Iran consistent with this JCPOA; and license the importation into the United States of Iranian-origin carpets and foodstuffs</em>.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>O</strong>ne of the year’s most-watched Supreme Court controversies, <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Limited v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission </em>[No. 16-111], was never likely to deliver the full faceoff between Religious Free Exercise and Anti-Discrimination Rights that many people expected.  As I’ll explain more fully below, cake baker Jack Phillip’s claim to avoid administrative sanctions despite refusing on religious grounds to sell a specialty cake to a couple celebrating their same-sex union depended upon a boutique Free Speech theory not likely to be generally usable by the nation’s businesses.

But <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop</em>always contained an even narrower option for a ruling; a 7-2 majority of the Supreme Court took this route when it handed down a limited win for the baker on June 4, 2018. The result was a modest reaffirmation of recent Court rulings red-lighting governmental-agency discrimination against religious believers.  The decision generally left for another day the question still resonating in political, social and legal circles – whether and to what extent sincerely held religious beliefs can overcome the rights of others to be treated with equal dignity.

Among the many interesting dimensions of <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop</em>, I’ll focus on three.  First, the case provides a particularly high-profile example of how the legal issues actually argued to the Court can depart sharply from what many Americans understand the legal issues to be from media coverage and general conversation.  Second, <em>Masterpiece Cake Shop </em>likely suggests how, by the time constitutional issues are subjected to full briefing and oral argument, they may look very different (and much more troublesome) than they did when initial certiorari review was granted; as a result, the justices may come to see that discretion is the better part of valor.  Third, the recent decision provides the second prominent example in two years of how justice alignments on religious-freedom cases don’t cleave along strictly ideological lines.

<em><u>The Gap between Legal Issues Anticipated and Actually Argued</u></em>

<em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>was never a likely vehicle for broadly resolving the fight between religious scruples and same-sex-marriage equality.  From the opening pages of their briefs, both Petitioner Phillips and the Trump Administration (as a “friend of the Court”) emphasized that the baker was a “cake artist” whose one-of-a-kind specialty cakes were akin to personally created art works.  Thus, compelling Phillips to design a cake for a same-sex couple despite his religious scruples -- or suffer administrative sanctions for dishonoring Colorado laws forbidding discrimination on prohibited bases (including sexual orientation) – arguably forced Phillips to (as his main brief put it) “convey ideas [he] deem[s] objectionable” in violation of First Amendment rights against “compelled speech.”

Normally an infrequently litigated Free Speech byway, the compelled-speech doctrine figures in no fewer than three cases on the Supreme Court’s docket this Term.  (In addition to <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop</em>, compelled speech arguments were prominent in Janus v. AFSCME [No. 16-1466; argued February 26, 2018], which disputed laws requiring objecting members of public-employee unions to pay “agency fees” to support some union representation activities, and <em>National Institute of Family &amp; Life Advocates</em><em>v. Becerra </em>[No. 16-1140; argued March 20, 2018], which considered a California law requiring pregnancy-consultation services to make disclosures to their patients.)

But as interesting as compelled speech was for the justices this Term, the doctrinal rubric meant that a ruling for Phillips should not have automatically meant an across-the-board right of businesses to refuse to trade with LBGTQ customers.  Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>suggested as much, by noting that “it is a general rule that [religious and philosophical] objections do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.”

Phillips’ argument was that custom cakes “necessarily express ideas about marriage and the couple, and as a result, they are entitled to full constitutional protection.”  The list of providers of goods and services who can plausibly claim to “express ideas” through their business transactions is a limited subcategory.  To take the wedding context, maybe florists, caterers and hairdressers can – but seemingly not the hotel that rents the hall, the limousine service delivering guests, etc.

Note, please, that I’m in no way denying that a win for Phillips on speech grounds could have been a noteworthy (and disturbing) <em>opening wedge </em>in a continuing drive to, as Colorado’s brief put it, “severely undermine anti-discrimination laws.”  My more limited point is that it would have taken some major judicial huffing and puffing to inflate <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>into a general Religion vs. Anti-discrimination square off.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>Seeing that Less is More</em></span>

Of course, the Court didn’t end up deciding <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>on the more limited compelled-speech ground anyway.  Instead, seven justices relied on intemperate remarks made by members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and the Commission’s seemingly contradictory handling of several cases involving bakers to hold that the Commission had expressed unconstitutional “hostility” to Phillips’ religious beliefs.  By relying on facts peculiar to one state’s administrative proceedings as the basis for ruling for the baker, the Court further marginalized the precedential value of its holding.

Just last Term, in <em>Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer </em>[137 S.Ct. 2012 (2017)], the Justices built on a 1993 precedent invalidating a Florida city’s ordinance against “animal sacrifices.” [<em>Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah</em>, 508 U.S. 520 (1993)]  The <em>Trinity Lutheran </em>ruling struck down Missouri’s refusal to give an otherwise-qualified school a playground-upgrade grant because the school was a religious day school.  <em>Trinity Lutheran </em>emphasized that government violates the Constitution when it “expressly discriminates” against an individual or entity “solely because” of the “religious character” of their activities.

Through the <em>Trinity Lutheran </em>lens, seven <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>justices saw unconstitutional anti-religious hostility in 1) disparaging statements from a Colorado Civil Rights Commissioner about Phillips’ views (example: associating Phillips’ religious views with “despicable” religious “rhetoric” used “to justify all kinds of discrimination” throughout history, including slavery and the Holocaust) and 2) the Commission’s failure to let Phillips refuse to provide his cake while allowing other bakers to decline to bake cakes that would have “convey[ed] disapproval or same-sex marriage.”

Thus, <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>ended up modestly confirming the evolving “anti-religious-discrimination” principle by applying it to yet another context.  In so doing, the justices avoided dealing with a number of difficult questions posed by a ruling for the baker on Free Speech grounds.  Key uncomfortable questions would have included the following:  What kind of signal, if any, should the Court send about the dividing line between the creative artist and the more work-a-day goods-and-services provider?  And, what if such an artist refuses to trade with women, Jews or African-Americans on alleged religious grounds?

Because the deliberations of the justices on the way to and after oral argument are confidential, I can’t prove that the justices were motivated by avoiding questions that likely grew in vexatiousness as the briefs piled up and the bench memos circulated.  Still, it seems a good bet that as the litigation progressed, the appeal of the discretion-equals-valor maxim grew.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>A Non-ideological Free Exercise Coalition</em></span>

Given its relatively limited reach, <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop</em>may be more interesting in confirming the present Court’s less-than-ideologically pure approach to questions of religious Free Exercise.

The vote alignment in <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>mirrored the vote alignment in the <em>Trinity Lutheran </em>case.  In both decisions, two justices generally associated with the “liberal” side of civil-liberties cases (Justices Breyer and Kagan) joined their five “conservative/moderate” brethren in voting to uphold Free Exercise rights against perceived discrimination based on religious status.  This put Breyer and Kagan at odds with their normal compatriots in other individual-rights cases, Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor.

True, as in <em>Trinity Lutheran, </em>some of the justices agreeing on the <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>outcome used concurring opinions to skirmish over secondary points.

Still, <em>Masterpiece Cakeshop </em>underlines a point that can get lost amid the tendency of some media sources and public commentators to reduce Supreme Court decision making to just politics: Often a host of other factors (including legal precedents and the group dynamics playing out as the justices strive to coalesce around a majority position) are at work.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>T</strong>he latest victim in the war against the rule of law and the supremacy of God are Christian faith-based Canadian universities whose graduates require professional licensing by an administrative agent of the government.

To understand the significance of the 2018 Trinity Western University (TWU) Supreme Court law society decisions, <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17140/index.do">British Columbia</a> and <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17141/index.do">Ontario</a>, the context must be understood.

Canada was once a Christian nation. Judicial activism since the adoption of the <a href="http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1982.html">Constitution Act, 1982</a>, has created jurisprudence hostile to Christian beliefs and values that distort the law and disregard precedents to impose secular values antagonistic to people of faith. The Supreme Court leads a cultural revolution that effectively incrementally purges Christian morality and values from law and society. Abortion, homosexual rights, and euthanasia decisions set the stage for the elimination of Christian trained lawyers from the profession.

The Ontario, Nova Scotia and BC law societies <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trinity-western-university-law-case-in-supreme-court-1.4425028">denied</a> approval of a proposed law school at TWU in Canada. TWU requires staff and students to agree to a statement of principles to abstain from premarital sex and recognizes only marriage between a man and a woman. BC and Ontario successfully argued their jurisdiction extends to governing internal rules of a law schools at a private Christian university. The Supreme Court of Canada (“SCC”) invited TWU to compromise its values, and to make the statement of principles optional, to accommodate the admission of all prospective students.

The TWU twin cases now serve as a bar to exclude Christians not just from the practice of law, but from any other regulated professional occupations. Soon graduates of foreign faith-based law schools, who seek admission through the accreditation gateway regulated by the Federation of Law Societies, will be barred. Next, practicing Christian lawyers will be purged.  Ontario’s law society has coerced every member to create a statement of principles that is inclusive of equality and diversity.  This implies agreeing to the LGBTQ values and political agenda. Failure to compromise means discipline and likely expulsion.

TWU’s nursing and teaching graduates are now at risk. Admission by anyone who earns an undergraduate degree from a faith-based university, may now be denied a license to practice as an engineer, physician, pharmacist, or any other field that is regulated.

To further understand the path that inevitably led to these consequences, it is important to appreciate how the legal issues were framed. The path TWU chose was to directly challenge any law society that stood in its way, rather than to open its school in a place where it was welcome, and accredited.

TWU’s choice to challenge the unfriendly law societies meant its case would be decided in the framework of administrative law, with its test of “reasonableness.” It was predictable that TWU would lose, since there was a range of “reasonable” results that could favor the law societies, and a much weaker legal constitutional case would result.

Had TWU built its school in a friendly jurisdiction, a graduating law student denied admission on grounds other than character or academic credentials, could have launched a court Charter challenge based upon denial of mobility rights, liberty, association, inequality, and freedom of religion. Charter infringements would have been found, and on the s. 1 test established in the case of <u><a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/117/index.do">Oakes</a></u>, victory for the law graduate was likely. A Declaration could have been issued by the Court ordering admission to any law society that discriminated against the graduate.

Historically, a faith-based educational institution, like TWU, is entitled to religious freedom. The Charter protects TWU from the intrusive interference from the government actors like law societies (the state). The state may not deviate from its role of neutrality.

Since a law society is a creature of <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-l8/latest/rso-1990-c-l8.html">statute</a>, it represents the state. Its powers are government actions, which are limited by statute. The main purpose of a law society is to ensure that all members, and future members, of the law profession, meet minimum standards of competence, namely good character and academic merit. This mandate never before extended to interfering with or policing the internal code of conduct of a private law school, not subject to constitutional limitations.

The pivotal issue before the SCC was the jurisdiction of the law societies to regulate a private religious law school to achieve the public interest goal of equal access to law school by diverse applicants. The majority of the SCC deviated from the law. A private school not previously subject to the Charter, was made inferior to law societies that are governed by provincial statutes that are inferior and subject to the Charter.

Dissenting justices Brown and Cote agreed that exceeding legitimate powers authorized by statutes is a very serious abuse of discretion that will not be tolerated in a society governed by the rule of law. It is an established principle of law, declared by the SCC in the landmark case of <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2751/index.do"><u>Roncarelli v. Duplessis</u></a>, (1959) that a discretionary clear departure from the perspective within which a statute is intended to operate “is just as objectionable as fraud or corruption.” Until now, no Canadian law society has been given the legal right to regulate law schools.

The dissenting justices also remarked that the TWU’s clause concerning sexual intimacy is consistent with the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/FullText.html">Civil Marriage Act</a> S.C. 2005, c. 33, which states in the preamble: “Whereas it is not against the public interest to hold and publicly express diverse views on marriage.” Yet the majority of the SCC found that the TWU’s rule to express a diverse view of marriage and to associate with others who hold the same belief, <em>was against</em> in the public interest, an opposite conclusion from the <em>Civil Marriage Act</em>. The SCC failed to recognize that allowing TWU to offer an alternative law school education to the secular law schools of Canada that actively promote the LGBTQ agenda, <em>was</em> in the public interest, by promoting diversity and respecting the multicultural heritage of Canada. Instead, purging Christian values not held by individual justices, was assumed to be in the public interest.

The SCC majority created a parallel unwritten constitution of unsourced, undefined and amorphous constitutional “values” that exist in the minds of individual justices, to trump TWU’s constitutional rights that are enshrined in the text of the Charter of Rights. Charter rights that are constitutionally entrenched, intended to protect private religious schools from state intrusion, are now subordinate to morphing Charter values that exist in the minds of justices and justify intrusion by the state. In other words, the shield has become the sword.

This new approach is a toolkit designed to achieve social and legal goals not permitted by established jurisprudence. Words and phrases, such as “equality,” “justice,” “human rights” and “dignity” have now become rhetorical means to implement the personal value judgments of individual justices and a means to circumvent established constitutional rights held by Christians that stand in the way of political correctness. The majority of the SCC decided that rejecting TWU’s plans to establish a law school did not limit religious freedom to any significant extent, trivializing TWU’s and the law’s Christian heritage.

There remains an implied invitation to open a law school, as long as it conformed to secular values. The court created a dilemma for TWU. It could compromise and accept LGBTQ students without conditions or to abandon its plans to create a faith-based law school if compromise were deemed fatal to the school’s mission.

TWU’s law school was intended to provide an alternative balanced legal education for Christian law students and professors now forced to study or teach in a foreign country to bypass secular law schools that discriminate against potential Christian faculty members who are routinely refused interviews and indoctrinate all law students with prevailing politically correct values, without tolerance or accommodation, or serious consideration of opposing viewpoints.

Freedom of religion is more than mere belief; it includes the right to live one’s faith in association with others of like mind in daily life. In a free and democratic society, based on multiculturalism, diversity is celebrated by allowing religious communities to flourish. This basic law was ignored by the majority of the SCC.

The legacy of the rejection of TWU’s accreditation as a law school may result over time in the eventual removal of all Christian lawyers from the public square, unless there is universal conformity to the coerced values of the secular law societies. Without people of faith regaining political control of the appointment of judges, the governance of law societies and the legislative branch of government, the current Cultural Revolution that purges Christian morality from Canadian law and Christian lawyers from the practice of law will continue and expand into persecution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>J</strong>une 26th is the United Nations’ <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/torturevictimsday/">International Day in Support of Victims of Torture</a>. Its purpose -- to denounce the crime of torture and proclaim solidarity with its survivors -- is in stark opposition to the policy of my government.

As a former Chief Prosecutor of an international war crimes tribunal in West Africa, I walked the countryside, interviewing hundreds of victims -- often people who had been tortured by their own government. The atrocities scarred them physically, emotionally, and psychologically for life.

But they shared their stories enthusiastically with our team, willing to relay the horror in order to receive human empathy, long after giving up hope of finding anything resembling justice.

Having prosecuted the officials of other governments for torture, I now find myself in a United States increasingly identified with torture and cruelty. Intensifying torture was Presidential campaign rhetoric. A person who oversaw waterboarding in black site prisons is promoted to lead the CIA. Children are removed from their families as they flee gang violence. The U.S. reportedly now plans to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-us-un-human-rights-council-20180619-story.html">leave</a> the UN Human Rights Council, although a member has never before departed that body voluntarily.

How did we get here?

A leader in building the post-World War II consensus against torture and for the rule of law, the United States chose a path of lawless brutality after the horrendous crime of 9/11. Lashing out broadly at Muslims, it threw aside its own rules and embarked on the rendition, detention and interrogation program (<a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-fact-sheet-ssci-study-on-detention-interrogation-program.html">RDI</a>).

Our government embraced torture, long known by interrogation professionals to be counter-productive. It did so as an attempt at payback, out of anger. Weak justifications defied logic, morality, and international legal norms that had stood for decades.

Two Libyan victims of the RDI program, Abdul-Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima Boudchar, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/09/settlement-in-abdul-hakim-belhaj-rendition-case-to-be-announced">exemplify</a> how far the U.S. moved to the dark side. They were on their way to the U.K. to seek asylum as opponents of the Gaddafi regime. With intelligence from the U.K., the CIA detained them in Thailand and tortured them: painful stress positions, drugs, and vicious beatings. Boudchar was several months pregnant.

From Thailand they were rendered to Libya, to the hands of their enemies, where they suffered further torture. Ms. Boudchar was released from prison just three weeks before she gave birth.

Fourteen years later, the British Prime Minister finally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/10/britain-apologises-for-appalling-treatment-of-abdel-hakim-belhaj">issued an apology</a> for the U.K.’s role in the couple’s rendition and torture, a crime led by the United States. Stating that her country had contributed to the couple's capture, Teresa May admitted “neither of you should have been treated this way,” and apologized unreservedly.

Less than a month later, the European Court of Human Rights also repudiated torture. It delivered judgments against Romania and Lithuania, which both hosted secret CIA torture prisons, finding this supporting role a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In stark contrast, at the same time such moral progress was occurring across the Atlantic, the U.S. confirmed a key figure in the RDI program to lead the CIA. <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/gina-haspel">Gina Haspel</a> oversaw detention and torture at a black site occupied by Abd al-Rahim Al-Nashiri, the detainee whom the European Court said was subject to “an extremely harsh interrogation regime.”

What are citizens to do when their government doubles down on its torture record?

I am part of one attempt to answer that question and give the survivors a safe space to tell their stories. I am a Commissioner of the <a href="http://www.nccit.org/">North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture</a> (NCCIT). As part of the RDI program, the CIA used contractors and public facilities in North Carolina to move victims around the world to be tortured. Now local citizens are demanding to know how and why this was allowed to occur.

At our public hearing last year, former <a href="http://www.nccit.org/detainees/">detainee</a> Mohamedou Slahi — who suffered sleep deprivation, beatings and sexual humiliation by the U.S. government — said that just telling his story to that audience gave him some comfort. While we cannot provide the type of international justice I did in Sierra Leone, we will release a formal report in September. We will make recommendations to local, state and national government; and to citizens, on how to provide redress to the survivors and prevent the U.S. from ever resuming such a program again.

As we reflect on the United States’ shameful torture history on this International Day for Victims of Torture, we must consider what might constitute meaningful redress for the survivors. Our moral standing and ability to lead depend upon it.

Dr. Dean Ornish <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/ornish-doctors-view-torture-103701">speaks</a> of a nation that tortures with these words: <em>When we torture people, even if we win the battle, we’ve already lost the war for hearts and minds. Especially our own.</em>

		<title>US Foreign Policy Can&#039;t Ignore Human Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>U</strong>S President Donald Trump traveled to Singapore to negotiate urgent nuclear matters, and not to discuss North Korean violations of basic human rights. Nonetheless, any such willful US indifference to these violations in another country, especially when they are as stark and egregious as they are in North Korea, represents a sorely grievous disregard for America's vital obligations under international law. Moreover, because these core obligations are an integral and incorporated portion of US law, this President's open indifference to North Korean crimes is also a violation of the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>Under various mutually reinforcing norms of both national and international law - norms that are known formally as "peremptory" or "<em>jus cogens</em>" rules because they can permit "no derogation" -  an American president has no right to ignore North Korean crimes against human rights because "there are other bad guys out there." Jurisprudentially, at least, such an evident presidential <em>non sequitur</em> is neither a proper nor exculpatory "plea." Additionally, the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">US Declaration of Independence</a> codifies a social contract that sets human rights infringement limits on the power of <em>any</em> government. In essence, because justice, which is based on "natural law," binds all human society, those specific rights articulated by the <em>Declaration</em> can never be reserved exclusively to Americans.</p>
<p>Instead, these rights necessarily extend to all human societies, and, following the authoritative <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/NT_Vol-I.pdf">Nuremberg Tribunal judgments of 1945-46</a>, can no longer be considered as issues of "domestic jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Incontestably, this is the binding law. For Mr. Trump to suggest otherwise would be both illogical and self-contradictory, as it would nullify the immutable and universal "law of nature" from which the <em>Declaration</em> - and indeed, the entire United States Constitutional Republic - derives. To be sure, very few Americans are even remotely aware of this basic history or corollary jurisprudence, but the facts and the law still remain valid and binding. Speaking of history, the actual conveyance of natural law thinking into American Constitutional theory was largely the work of John Locke's classic <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf">Second Treatise on Civil Government.</a></p>
<p>While fellow English philosopher Thomas Hobbes had regarded natural law and civil law as automatically coextensive, Locke echoed a more than two thousand year tradition with his contrary view that the civil law must always be consistent with pre-existing natural law.</p>
<p>Today, for US President Trump's benefit, it is worth noting that the well-known American duty to revolt whenever governments commit "a long train of abuses and usurpations" flows directly from John Locke's idea that civil authority can never extend beyond the protection of an individual's natural rights. Derivatively, Mr. Trump's properly criticized current policy of separating parents and children among refugees to the United States fleeing insufferable regimes elsewhere is <em>prima facie</em> a violation of international law <em>and</em> its variously codified US incorporations. In this connection, it also goes without saying that any such US violations seriously impair our national interests and our ideals at the same time.</p>
<p>Accepting the aptly famous legal maxim - <em>jus ex injuria non oritur</em>, "rights do not arise from wrongs" - Mr. Trump should at least grasp the fundamental traditions and laws of his own country, and ought finally acknowledge them as the only permissible standard for further global interactions.</p>
<p>There is more. "America First" makes no practical or legal sense. On every conceivable dimension of assessment, it is utterly destined to fail.</p>
<p>The basic principles of the international law of human rights are already incorporated into statutes of the United States. Accordingly and unequivocally, the US Department of State is required to enforce the human rights provisions mandated by sections 116 (d) and 502B(b) of the <a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Foreign%20Assistance%20Act%20Of%201961.pdf">Foreign Assistance Act of 1961</a>, as amended.</p>
<p>Founded upon an irrational fear of both past and future, the Trump administration's unhidden indifference to indispensable human rights (both internationally and nationally) is already generating a fearful kind of national aloneness, an anti-intellectual orientation that is inherently flawed and openly self-defeating. For the United States, and for the world in general, meaningful survival and progress now mandate renunciation of the long-discredited principle, "Everyone for himself." Now, to be sure, it is no longer even possible to cite as "realistic" a national foreign policy that is at explicit cross-purposes with worldwide dignity and human well-being.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1945/mistral-facts.html">Gabriela Mistral</a>, the Chilean poet who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945, once wrote that crimes against human rights carry within themselves "a moral judgment over an evil in which every feeling man and woman concurs." At this particularly perilous time in our US presidential history, a last real hope for preventing such evil must lie in enhanced compliance with the complementary imperatives of America's basic traditions and its relevant laws. With such compliance, and not with the plainly conspicuous degradations of "America First," this country could still replace US President Donald Trump's unlawful disregard for compassionate and purposeful human interactions with a desperately-needed ethos of both national and planetary renewal.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>J</strong>ustice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/read-justice-anthony-kennedy-retirement-letter/index.html">announcement</a> yesterday rightfully set off shock waves across the country. For the past three decades, Justice Kennedy has gone from one of the more moderate justices who could <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/case.pdf">sometimes swing</a> an important vote, to the lone decider on monumental issues from <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">gay marriage</a> (siding with the liberals) to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">campaign finance</a> and Second Amendment <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">rights</a> (siding with the conservatives). The power of the swing vote in major cases has certainly rendered Justice Kennedy the most powerful justice and has <a href="http://commonconstitutionalist.com/political-stuff/justice-anthony-kennedy-more-powerful-than-any-president/">led some to question</a> whether he wields more power than any other official in the federal government.

It would not be a stretch to say that Justice Kennedy’s retirement announcement <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/06/27/the-gop-reaps-its-reward-for-selling-its-soul-to-trump/?utm_term=.277fb605f459">stunned and dismayed</a> most liberals and progressives. This despite Justice Kennedy being a Reagan appointee who did not side with the liberals in a single 5-4 decision this year even with hot-button issues such as <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf">gay and lesbian rights</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf">public union rights</a>, and the legality of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf">Trump’s travel ban</a> all coming before the court. Put simply, Justice Kennedy has swung big cases toward traditionally liberal causes, but those instances were infrequent and increasingly rare. On the whole, he has been far more conservative than liberal.

So why is Justice Kennedy’s retirement a big deal? Is it simply that the occasional, albeit monumental case, such as the gay marriage decision, will occasionally swing the other way? The answer should be a resounding no. Justice Kennedy’s value to the Court and the country comes not from the substance of his decisions but from his approach to judicial decision-making. Fear from the left, even from those who know very little about Supreme Court process, should stem not primarily from the loss of Justice Kennedy’s occasional progressive decision but from the likely constrictive and repressive approach from the justice who will replace him.

The schism between Justice Kennedy’s brand of conservative jurisprudence and the methodology of the justice who will likely succeed him is in part illustrated by how very conservative justices talk about the nature of deciding cases. Justice Gorsuch <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/here-s-judge-gorsuch-s-full-opening-statement-n735961">stated</a> in his confirmation hearing, “Justice Scalia was a mentor[]. He reminded us that words matter — that the judge’s job is to follow the words that are in the law — not replace them with words that aren’t.” This seemingly insignificant and obvious statement highlights the maxim of the modern American conservative judge – the literal word of the text reigns supreme, if not exclusive, and looking elsewhere for any further meaning or purpose constitutes impermissible judicial policy making or “legislating from the bench.” That theory deserves some credence. After all, judges are tasked with interpreting rather than making the laws, and any time a judge strays into changing the application of the text in any way, he or she inches ever closer to usurping the democratically elected legislature. Furthermore, acts of Congress, executive orders, and even the Constitution, all have democratic mechanisms by which they can be repealed, superseded, or amended. In short, the people vote for legislators who make the laws – justices with lifetime appointments only clarify those laws when disputes arise.

This principle is hammered home by the dissenting justices in response to Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=817374415512515860&amp;q=obergefell&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Obergefell v. Hodges</a></u>. In <u>Obergefell</u> the Court found the right to same sex marriage in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that no state shall “<span>deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</span> The Fourteenth Amendment, passed in 1866, obviously does not overtly reference same sex marriage nor did the people at the time contemplate that it would be used to one day validate same sex marriage. For any likely Trump appointee, like the four dissenters, the case would end there without any consideration of the merits of the issue. Justice Roberts responds to Justice Kennedy by stating, “[s]tripped of its shiny rhetorical gloss, the majority’s argument is that the Due Process Clause gives same-sex couples a fundamental right to marry because it will be good for them and for society.” Justice Scalia, lamenting Justice Kennedy’s celebratory tone, states, “[t]he Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.” The dissents total 63 cumulative pages, all laced with scathing remarks and countless pointed jabs. The closest thing to a response Justice Kennedy puts forward in the majority opinion is his contention that “[a]n individual can invoke a right to constitutional protection when he or she is harmed, even if the broader public disagrees and even if the legislature refuses to act.” Judge <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/supreme_court_gay_marriage_john_roberts_dissent_in_obergefell_is_heartless.html">Richard Posner</a> and former Justice <a href="https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/79955/OSLJ_V77N5_0913.pdf?sequence=5">John Paul Stevens</a>, both appointed by Republican presidents, released articles shortly following the decision that address the major points in the dissenting opinions, much of which Justice Kennedy no doubt realized but chose not to address.

Nevertheless, Justice Kennedy’s willingness to go beyond the text or exceed what he views as the powers of the judiciary had its limits. Most recently he showed this limit in the case that upheld Trump’s travel ban, <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf">Trump v. Hawaii</a></u>. There, the majority, despite a mountain of extrinsic evidence, largely consisting of tweets and remarks that Donald Trump made at campaign rallies, held that the travel ban does not constitute religious discrimination because it is facially neutral and well within the congressionally delegated powers to the president. Justice Kennedy joined the majority opinion in full, but he added a short concurrence, his last words on the court, where he declares, only collaterally apropos to the issue at hand that “[a]n anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.” With his parting sentence, Justice Kennedy directs us not to the words of the constitution, as so many prospective high Court appointees will surely perceive themselves bound, but instead to the principles of the Constitution. That is, even in upholding a travel ban passed with substantial evidence of religious animus, Justice Kennedy instructs commitment to the liberties the constitution seeks to preserve and protect and not merely the words that are written on the page.

Justice Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 after the Senate <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/to-bork-or-not-to-bork-the-old-fight-that-shows-democrats-why-and-how-to-stop-gorsuch">failed</a> to confirm Robert Bork, a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-bork-20121221-story.html">pioneer</a> of conservative, originalist judicial interpretation who many at the time saw as too radical to hold a place on the high court. Liberals will likely point to Justice Kennedy’s high marks on the Court as the handful of decisions and votes where he exceeded the textual bounds on which any Trump appointee is likely to rule – the four same sex rights decisions, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/517/620/case.html">Romer</a>, <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/gender/lawrencevtx.pdf">Lawrence</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">Windsor</a>, and Obergefell; <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/04pdf/03-633.pdf">Roper</a>, which held that the death penalty cannot apply to children under the age of 18; <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.pdf">Fisher</a>, which upheld limited affirmative action measures at universities; and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene</a>, which held that prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have the right to seek habeas corpus. Conservatives likely condemn those decisions, both in method and result, while lauding others, such as <u>Citizens United</u>. Even in his unfortunate support of the travel ban, Justice Kennedy reaffirmed that there are times when one must go beyond the plain words on the page to address tyranny, injustice, and oppression. Let us hope that whoever takes his place feels the same.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>T</strong>he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/read-justice-anthony-kennedy-retirement-letter/index.html">retirement</a> of Justice Anthony Kennedy this week represents the end of an era and the beginning of the entrenchment of a more conservative Supreme Court, probably for years to come. That much seems clear. But there are actually many more sides to Justice Kennedy’s retirement than that simple statement implies.

Justice Kennedy was nominated to the Court in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. Everything about his nomination bespoke an earlier, less politically polarized moment in American history. Kennedy replaced another centrist figure on the Court, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/justices/lewis_f_powell_jr">Justice Lewis Powell</a>. Kennedy was not identified with a conservative ideology or methodology of interpretation, in contrast to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/politics/borks-nomination-is-rejected-5842-reagan-saddened.html">failed nomination</a> of Judge Robert Bork, whose place Kennedy took on the Court. <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-justice-kennedy-replaced-powell-and-bork-at-the-court">Kennedy was confirmed</a> by a vote of 97-0, with three Democrats absent from the Senate. A similarly unanimous confirmation vote for any Supreme Court nominee is inconceivable today.

For much of his time on the Court, Justice Kennedy has functioned as a deciding vote. This has especially been the case since the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/press/oconnor070105.pdf">retirement</a> of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in 2006. In recent years, there have generally been two opposed four-Justice blocs on the Court, one liberal and one conservative, with Justice Kennedy often in the middle.

This has led to a certain misconception about Justice Kennedy. He is best known for a series of liberal positions in the areas of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&amp;q=planned+parenthood+of+southeastern+pa+v+casey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">gay rights</a>, the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11619441780737591071&amp;q=kennedy+v+louisiana&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">death penalty</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.pdf">affirmative action</a>. But most of his votes during his tenure on the Court have actually been cast in a conservative direction. That reality was especially evident during this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/supreme-court-2017-term/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9aba8d5de6d8">past term</a>, when he sided with the conservative bloc in a series of important cases.

Certainly, Justice Kennedy’s main legacy will be a series of liberal positions. Since joining Justices O’Connor and David Souter in the 1992 plurality reaffirming <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673&amp;q=roe+v+wade&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Roe v. Wade</a></u>—albeit a somewhat diminished version—in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&amp;q=planned+parenthood+of+southeastern+pa+v+casey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a></u>, Justice Kennedy has stood firm against any effort to overrule <u>Roe</u>. Justice Kennedy has permitted restrictions on abortion—he authored the 2007 opinion upholding a ban on partial birth abortions in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5971780753882938659&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Gonzales v. Carhart</a></u>—but Roe was safe while he remained on the Court. President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/neil-gorsuch-confirmation-hearings-updates-and-analysis-on-the-supreme-court-nominee/trump-promised-judges-who-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/?utm_term=.a6604b92ca87">promised</a> to appoint Justices who will overturn Roe and now he will have the opportunity to finally fulfill this promise.

Similarly, Justice Kennedy authored a series of important decisions concerning gay rights, most significantly <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284&amp;q=Lawrence+v.+Texas&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Lawrence v. Texas</a></u> in 2003, outlawing the criminalization of adult, consensual gay sex, and <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">Obergefell v. Hodges</a></u> in 2015, constitutionalizing the right to same-sex marriage. <u>Obergefell</u> is now also potentially on the judicial chopping block.
In contrast to those threats, Justice Kennedy’s juvenile sentencing cases <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16987406842050815187&amp;q=roper+v+simmons&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">limiting</a> death penalty and life without parole sentences for offenders under 18 at the time of the crime, seem pretty secure, even with a more conservative Court. Likewise, his important suggestion in 2007, in a concurrence in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1651344272115134809&amp;q=Parents+Involved+v.+Seattle&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Parents Involved v. Seattle School District</a></u>, that “race-conscious” actions by school authorities taken to prevent segregated schools, might not constitute racially discriminatory action for constitutional purposes, might yet prove a workable distinction in that field.

In the area of religion, Justice Kennedy’s legacy is pretty evenly balanced. He authored both the important precedent <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=140480915250262562&amp;q=Lee+v.+Weisman&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Lee v. Weisman</a></u> in 1992, outlawing government sponsored prayer at public school graduations, and, just this term, the <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf">Masterpiece Cakeshop</a></u> opinion, protecting the right of a baker to refuse to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding, for reasons of religious conscience. In the <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5322529599500468186&amp;q=Hobby+Lobby&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Hobby Lobby</a></u> case in 2014, Justice Kennedy wrote a noteworthy concurrence attempting to bridge the gap between the majority’s protection of religious liberty and the dissent’s argument in favor of the rights of female workers by suggesting alternative means for the government to provide contraception coverage.

But most of Justice Kennedy’s decisions are firmly conservative. Certainly that is so with regard to free speech. Justice Kennedy was the author of <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624&amp;q=Citizen%E2%80%99s+United+v.+FEC&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Citizen’s United v. FEC</a></u> in 2010, the case that recognized the right of corporations to engage in political speech and political funding, and, just this term, he joined decisions outlawing the agency fee for public sector unions—<u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf">Janus v. AFSCME</a></u>—and protecting the free speech rights of pro-life clinics in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1140_5368.pdf">NIFLA v. Becerra</a></u>.

Also during this term, Justice Kennedy joined the conservative bloc in allowing Ohio to purge voter rolls in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-980_f2q3.pdf">Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute</a></u>, restricting the right of workers to file class-action lawsuits against their employers in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-285_q8l1.pdf">Epic Systems v. Lewis</a></u>, and upholding President Trump’s travel ban in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf">Trump v. Hawaii</a></u>. To that extent, Justice Kennedy’s retirement will just reinforce an already conservative-leaning Court.

The other sides of Justice Kennedy’s retirement are political and jurisprudential. Politically, this retirement and its implications vindicate the might-makes-right philosophy of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose disgraceful <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/03/16/republicans-refuse-to-budge-following-garland-nomination-to-supreme-court/?utm_term=.0594b867bdfa">refusal</a> to allow a vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/04/senate-confirms-gorsuch-for-supreme-court/">set the stage</a> for Justice Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court confirmation, which in turn will cement a conservative majority when Justice Kennedy’s replacement joins the Court.

On the other hand, this new conservative majority may turn out to be a case of be-careful-what-you-wish-for, for Republicans. For years, Republicans have rallied pro-life voters without delivering much of anything for them. Those voters will now expect <u>Roe</u> to be overruled. A failure to accomplish that result would severely weaken the Republican Party coalition.

But this previous Republican Party electoral strategy has been almost costless because pro-choice voters could not be similarly marshalled while <u>Roe</u> remained safely the law. As divided as Americans are about abortion, simply overruling <u>Roe</u> without any concurrent protections for women—a not unlikely judicial outcome with a more conservative majority—will be very unpopular with the American people. Even before that occurs, the confirmation vote on Justice Kennedy’s replacement will take place in the midst of next fall’s midterm election campaign and the prospect of <u>Roe</u>’s demise will energize Democratic voters.

Jurisprudentially, Justice Kennedy’s replacement is likely to further consolidate the conservative interpretive methodology of originalism. Justice Gorsuch was perhaps the first expressly originalist Supreme Court judicial nominee since the disastrous confirmation fight over Robert Bork. But he will not be the last. Justice Kennedy’s replacement will probably also publicly embrace originalism.

There is reason to be skeptical about Justice Gorsuch’s commitment to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/02/originalism-constitution-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch">originalism</a>—in his first important <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=860798951822514720&amp;q=Trinity+Lutheran&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,39">case</a>, he voted to require States to allow churches to participate in public funding programs under a non-originalist interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause—but there is no question that the philosophy of legal positivism is now ascendant. The conservative claim that judges should enforce the law without regard to norms, values or justice, is established. As Justice Gorsuch put it in his <u>Epic Systems</u> majority opinion, “The policy may be debatable but the law is clear.”

As monumental as all this sounds, there is reason to question how important a more conservative Supreme Court will turn out to be. The most obvious positions of the post-Kennedy Court are likely to be negative. The Court will be less protective, or not protective at all, of the right to choose, the right to same-sex marriage, the rights of criminal defendants and the right to vote. But the Supreme Court will not actually threaten these rights. The Justices simply may not defend them.

There are exceptions to this judicial passivity, of course. The new Court will be even more anti-union. It will protect big campaign contributors from regulation. It will protect religious believers in the exercise of conscience. And the Court may even attempt to limit the power of Congress to legislate.

But even in its more affirmative positions, these actions by the Court would still be marginal in terms of American public life as a whole. Such actions may make it a little more difficult to overturn the current status quo, but that is all the Justices really can do.

That leaves matters to the rest of us—the voters. For the retirement of Justice Kennedy may have the unexpected result of leading to a genuine rebirth of American democracy. Yes, efforts are made, often successfully, to interfere with the will of the voters. Gerrymandering is openly practiced. Voter ID laws are adopted for partisan purposes. The anti-democratic structures of the Constitution—the Electoral College and the makeup of the Senate—also restrict majority rule. And big money wants to have its way.

Yet, with all that, the American people are not helpless. Basically, as the stalled effort to repeal Obamacare demonstrated, the will of the people still decides policy in America. We can have the country and the future that we insist upon. The question is really one of commitment. Anyone unhappy or fearful because of the retirement of Justice Kennedy has a clear path to follow—as the labor movement used to say, “go out and organize.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I</strong>n <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf">Janus v. AFSCME</a></u>, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, overturned a 41-year old precedent and held that all union security clauses in public-sector labor contracts violate the First Amendment. A union security clause is provision in a contract between a union and an employer that obliges members of the union bargaining unit to pay at least that portion of their dues that goes to “activities related to collective bargaining.”  <u>Janus</u> will significantly damage unions economically. That is because “duty of fair representation” (“DFR”) rules require unions to represent employees whether or not they pay dues. It will thus hurt the ability of unions to represent workers, and it will hurt the Democratic Party institutionally. It also creates some uncertainty regarding the First Amendment’s protection of public employee speech in other contexts.

<strong>Background</strong>

Union security clauses and the DFR arose out of the U.S model of “exclusive majority”

representation. Under this model, if a majority of a group of workers in an appropriate bargaining unit show that they support unionization, a union becomes the exclusive bargaining representative for all the workers in that unit (if only a minority support unionization, no union results). The DFR is a corollary duty: because unions have this exclusive power, they must represent employees in a fair, competent manner. Crucially, the DFR includes the duty to represent bargaining unit members in both contract negotiations and grievance/arbitration cases regardless of whether they pay dues.

Thus, so-called “right to work” laws – laws barring union security agreements, the rule <u>Janus</u> now imposes as a matter of Constitutional law – create significant “free rider” problems for unions. Under this rule, a not-insignificant number of employees will receive the benefits of union membership without paying for them. While some employees oppose unions and believe they could do better on their own, some employees are happy to be in a union but not pay dues. For example, as a brief in <u>Janus</u> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/janus-and-fair-share-fees-the-organizations-financing-the-attack-on-unions-ability-to-represent-workers/">showed</a>, unions have been recertified by a majority vote of employees, even though a majority had opted out of paying any dues.

The Supreme Court first ruled on union security clauses in public employment in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5312655975467812361&amp;q=Abood&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</a></u>. <u>Abood</u> wrestled with the First Amendment implications of a government contract requiring all bargaining unit members to pay dues when some might not support the union’s activities. The Court balanced the state’s interest in robust collective bargaining as a tool for effective management and labor peace against the constitutional interests of dissenting employees. It created the following compromise: union security clauses could require payment of that portion of union dues that went to activities “related to collective bargaining” but not that portion that went to activities not related to collective bargaining. Subsequent cases established that the main activities related to collective bargaining were contract negotiation and administration (including grievance/arbitration cases); the main activity not related was politics. Thus, under <u>Abood</u>, if a union spent 90% of its dues income on contract negotiation and administration and 10% on politics, a union security provision could not require objecting bargaining unit members to pay 10% of their dues. Courts and labor boards also developed rules about giving information to employees about their rights and opportunities to challenge a union’s calculations.

In recent years, however, it became clear that some Justices had grown skeptical of <u>Abood</u><em>. </em>Justice Alito first expressed his concerns in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11942047881597926307&amp;q=Knox+v.+Service+Employees+Intl+Union,+Local+1000&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Knox v. Service Employees Int’l Union, Local 1000</a></u> (“our prior decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the First Amendment can tolerate”). Then in <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8387185395641692428&amp;q=Harris+v.+Quinn&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Harris v. Quinn</a></u>, a five-member majority of the court, while reaching a much more limited decision on the facts, indicated a willingness to consider overturning <u>Abood</u>. Many thought <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5636434025908277595&amp;q=Friedrichs+v.+California+Teachers+Ass%E2%80%99n&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Friedrichs v. California Teachers Ass’n</a></u> would overturn or alter <u>Abood</u>, but Justice Scalia’s death left the Court deadlocked 4-4, preserving <u>Abood</u>.

<u><strong>Janus</strong></u>

<u>Janus</u> overturned <u>Abood</u> entirely. The majority opinion by Justice Alito, joined by

Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kennedy, and Chief Justice Roberts, argued that <em>Abood</em>’s balancing was incorrect because it (i) undervalued plaintiffs’ First Amendment interests by using insufficiently strict scrutiny; and (ii) overvalued the state’s interest in union security clauses. Regarding the former, the majority rejected a comparison to the line of cases (<u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12292534138488546769&amp;q=Connick&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Connick</a></u><em>, </em><u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16997195768089298466&amp;q=Connick&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Pickering</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6711908971660042297&amp;q=Garcetti&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Garcetti</a></u>) in which the Court allowed the government significant discretion in limiting the free speech rights of individual public employees because of the government’s broad rights in its role as an employer. These cases include the rule that normal workplace grievances are not a matter of “public concern” and therefore cannot implicate the First Amendment. The <u>Janus</u> majority reasoned that the collective power of unions transformed speech about workplace matters normally outside the protection of the First Amendment into matters of public concern. It gave as an example the impact of public employees’ pay and benefits on public budgets, although it did not acknowledge that pension benefit levels (a main example) are illegal subjects of bargaining under almost all public-sector labor laws. Fundamentally, the majority essentially held that <em>everything</em> a public-sector union does is inherently a matter of public concern.

The majority also argued that <u>Abood</u> exaggerated the government’s interest in “labor peace” and collective bargaining. The majority stated that in “right to work” jurisdictions, including but not limited to the federal sector, unions represent their members in bargaining effectively.

The majority rejected the “free rider” argument, noting that unions in “right to work” jurisdictions still seek to become exclusive representatives, and thus they must see a benefit for themselves in that status. Intriguingly, the majority implied that states could alter DFR rules to allow unions to charge employees they represent who do not pay dues for the costs of arbitrations. Still, the majority warned that major distinctions between union members and those who do not pay dues (<em>e.g.</em>, in contract negotiations) were likely unconstitutional.

The majority felt unconstrained by <em>stare decisis</em> because of the reasons above and because, it argued, there is now more data about public-sector collective bargaining than there was at the time of <u>Abood</u>, when the first public-sector labor law was fifteen years old. This was an interesting assertion to make in a case with no factual record below.

Justice Kagan’s dissent, joined by Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Sotomayor, would have applied <em>stare decisis </em>because <u>Abood</u> had worked well in practice, matched the Court’s approach to the First Amendment rights of public employees generally, and is deeply entrenched in law and reality. Per <u>Abood</u>, employers receive significant benefits from bargaining with an exclusive representative (<em>e.g.</em>, not having to deal with multiple unions). This system, in turn, requires unions to have adequate funding to avoid being decimated by free riders. The issue, the dissent argued, is whether unions will be <em>able</em> to be effective negotiating partners, not whether they want to be.

The dissent stressed the individual employee speech cases, noting that government employers have substantial latitude to regulate employee speech, including the rule that the First Amendment does not protect speech relating to conditions of employment. It rejected the majority’s “special rule” for union speech, noting there has been no exception giving protection to speech involving policies that apply to groups of employees. Further, the inquiry should not be whether the public is interested in public employee speech, but rather whether the speech was about and directed to the workplace. The dissent also raised challenging hypos involving groups of non-union employees agitating for better benefits. It is now unclear whether such groups would be engaged in protected speech. Finally, the dissent maintained that even if union speech is a matter of public concern, under the balancing test, the employer’s interests should prevail.

The dissent concluded: “the majority has chosen the winners by turning the First Amendment into a sword and using it against workaday economic and regulatory policy.”

<strong>Impact</strong>

<u>Janus</u> will significantly diminish union resources. Estimates of membership loss range

from 8.5% -30%, with public safety and urban union members less likely to resign, and rural and lower-paid employees most likely. This will hurt the ability of unions to represent workers. While <u>Janus</u> only applies to public employees, because they constitute nearly half of all U.S. union members, it will hurt the entire labor movement. It will also hurt the Democratic Party. Where “right to work” rules have been implemented, the share of Democratic votes <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24259">drops</a> 3.5%. Professor Joseph McCartin <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/janus-v-democracy">argues</a> the decision will damage democracy itself.

Blue states may adjust some DFR rules. New York recently <a href="https://www.nysasbo.org/uploads/files/1523046068_Section%20208%20of%20the%20Civil%20Service%20Law.pdf">amended</a> its statute to allow union contracts to require those who do not pay dues to pay for their representation at arbitrations. This law and a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=4.&amp;title=1.&amp;part=&amp;chapter=11.5.&amp;article=">California law</a> require employers to give unions additional access to employees to make their pitch. The New York Times, citing Professor Benjamin Sachs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/opinion/supreme-court-janus-unions.html">argues</a> that public employers should be required to reimburse unions for bargaining costs. <a href="https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB923/2017">Hawaii HB923</a> would do that. Unions promise to redouble efforts at internal organizing. But this decision will do lasting damage.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>D</strong>espite the fact congress seems uncomfortable with funding President Trump’s wall on the southern border, the administration has constructed a legal wall against asylum seekers.

First, there was the <a href="http://time.com/5268572/jeff-sessions-illegal-border-separated/">announcement</a> of the ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy of criminalizing any individuals who comes to America in ways not considered correct. While it is intended to apply only to people entering without controls or illegally, its definition of illegal is overly broad. Often legal immigrants are <a href="https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/7xmjq4/trumps-zero-tolerance-border-policy-is-rounding-up-legal-immigrants-too">caught</a> up in the zero tolerance aggression displayed by border patrol officers and the military who are helping them enforce the policy.

Second, is the recent controversy about the separation of children from their families. Hundreds of children remain separated and the government seems unable or unwilling to reunite them. Even those it reunites are only being reunited to be deported, no matter what fear of persecution they harbor.

Third, even the recent Executive Order <a href="http://time.com/5317367/trump-executive-order-immigration/">signed</a> by President Trump to suspend the separation of children from their parents for at least a limited period of time did nothing to end the inhumane practice of family detention. In fact, due to the Zero Tolerance policy it is likely that more families will be detained, both woman and children.

Fourth, U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Sessions has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/10/politics/sessions-immigration-appeals-decision/index.html">started</a> referring immigration appeals to himself. In other words, the Attorney General took over a case from the Board of Immigration Appeals (B.I.A. or Board) in which his office was already a party. Although one might wonder how the US Government’s top lawyer can decide to review a case in which he is a party, the practice is provided for under immigration law.

Fifth, on 30 March 2018, the Attorney General promulgated <a href="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/04/02/immigration-judges-memo.pdf">new standards</a> for immigration judges in a critical Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) Performance Plan for Adjudicative Employees. This plan states that immigration judges will be judged, in part, on how many cases they complete. Read in the context of employees of the Attorney General it is easy to understand this as a ‘request-that-cannot-be-refused’ to reject more asylum-seekers, faster.-

Sixth, President Trump recently <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/05/trump-deport-immigrants-no-due-process-694904">claimed</a> that foreigners should be removed without any due process of law. A statement that only emphasizes the lack of respect for judicial independence in the federal system of immigration law.

For lawyers, the Attorney-General’s intervention may be the most striking development in US immigration law. Two cases illustrate with startling clarity the way the administration is interfering with even the minimal due process those fleeing persecution receive.

<u><a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1022366/download">In the Matter of Castro-Tum</a></u>, the Attorney-General decided that immigration judges and the B.I.A., which handles appeals from them, do not have the general authority to suspend indefinitely immigration proceedings by a process known as “administrative closure.” Prior to this decision administrative closure had been an important tool used by immigration judges to manage unwieldly full dockets. With his decision in this matter the Attorney General added an estimated 300,000 cases to the docket of the 350 immigration judges around the nation. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, in an interview with National Public Radio, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/17/612200263/sessions-moves-to-curb-immigration-judges-authority">lamented</a> the fact that the “Attorney General's decision in one fell swoop is overturning decades of recognized authority and practice.”

<u><a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1070866/download">In the Matter of A-B-</a></u>, 27 I7N 316 (A.G. 2018), the Attorney-General referred to himself and then decided a case concerning a woman who had fled her native Guatemala to escape the violent abuse of her spouse from whom the government would not or could not protect her. Ms. A-B- had been repeatedly beaten, raped, and subjected to emotional abuse by her husband, while she was married to him and afterwards. Ms. A-B- had been granted asylum in the United States after she had gone through the arduous asylum process. Attorney-General decided to get involved in her case this past March referring her case to himself for review. He then reversed the decision of the Board and sent Ms. A-B-‘s case back to the immigration judge. Not only did he remand the case, but he spent more than 30-pages essentially demanding that all those officers under his authority apply a very restrictive interpretation of the law. While the bulk of the anti-asylum-seeker rhetoric in the decision is obiter dicta, the mere fact that it was expressed by their boss is likely to scare some immigration judges into rejecting more asylum-seekers with overly restrictive interpretations of the law.

Strikingly, every official that dealt with Ms. A-B-‘s case to date has been an official in the Executive branch of the U.S. government. Ms. A-B- has not had a day in court with a judge who is impartial and independent and not part of the Executive branch of government.

Such action is contrary to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/3b66c2aa10">United Nations Refugee Convention</a>, which has been codified in U.S. domestic law in the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg102.pdf">Refugee Act of 1980</a>, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which the U.S has ratified with the reservation denying it creates individual rights, and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Convention against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a>, which the U.S. has ratified with a <a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en#EndDec">reservation</a> defining “’cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ as meaning only that as defined by U.S. courts as contrary to the Fifth, Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.”

The executive branch interferences with the fundamental human rights of foreigners coming to America are only likely to increase. This is in no small part due to the U.S. Supreme Court narrow 5-4 decision in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf">Trump v. Hawaii</a></u> issued on June 26, 2018, that allows the President largely unbridled discretion over U.S. immigration policy. The Court was unfettered by the restraints of international law requiring due process and prohibiting discrimination. Despite being confronted with multiple constitutional challenges with enough merit to have been upheld, at least in part, by several Courts of Appeals, the Court decided that it should undertake its weakest form of judicial review. This form of review is called ‘rationale basis review’ whereby the government merely has to show that their action is rationally related to a legitimate end.

Ironically, the Supreme Court may have unwittingly exposed how the current administration will treat immigrants going forward. It did this by criticizing the notorious case of <u><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17472067348800549778&amp;q=Korematsu+v.+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Korematsu v. United States</a></u> that had upheld the discriminatory internment of Japanese in America, calling it “morally repugnant” and “gravely wrong,” while at the same time holding that the President enjoys broad discretion to deal with immigrants. In this broad discretion, the Court found that the President’s mere claims of security concerns were “a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review.”

In effect the Supreme Court has erected an “Immigrants Need Not Apply” sign at the U.S. border. If you are a migrant coming to the United States from a country whose nationals the President feels are dangerous, then you can’t enter the United States. This is indeed an odd message from a country that was built from the blood and sweat of immigrants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>I</strong>n a bombing, the dust settles slowly over the strike zone. What emerges are grey images, living beings neutralized to monochrome. Bleeding from the ears, deaf, and dumb from the concussions the survivors walk about in a haze. These zombies are the first things you see staggering down the street away from the rubble behind them, rubble that is the tomb of loved ones, neighbors, and friends.

There is no militarily necessary reason for the destruction, the strike carried out by one of the combatants who knew or should have known about the laws of armed conflict. The rules do not matter in most conflicts of the 21st century. Welcome to the dirty little wars that nip at the heels of civilization, a civilization grown weary of it all and who look the other way. It is just too hard to marshal enough political will to do something.

A powerless United Nations can do nothing other than to help ease the pain of air strikes by caring for the wounded and the terrified refugees. The once proud mandate of restoring international peace and security has changed to <em>maintaining at best</em> that peace and security.

The three nations that could restore that prominence, the United States, China, and Russia are its biggest challenges and all three could certainly live without the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/maintain-international-peace-and-security/">paradigm of peace set forth in 1945</a>. All three of those nations over the past years are also the biggest human rights abusers led by strong men.

International Law has evolved over centuries through customary practice and the consent of nations to bind themselves to certain norms. Indeed the day-to-day actions in commerce, trade, and finance all hinge upon these norms. Over time, other norms that declare that human beings have rights to be free from want, fear, and to speak their minds and worship freely are now enforceable and carry an accounting if violated.

From all this just twenty-five years ago, modern international criminal law began. For a decade or so, the rule of law prevailed regarding holding those who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable. Yet we have slipped down a slippery slope. That political will is waning and the use of the law to govern international relations regarding humanity challenged.

In this kaleidoscopic void, dirty little wars flourish like weeds in an abandoned lot. Yemen is one of those weeds thriving in the dusty haze of airstrikes.

The likes of the Yemeni conflict exists but for this condition and circumstance. A surrogate conflict backed by cynical nations vying for power and influence in the greater region that is the Middle East, the possibility of a peaceful resolution hinges on the rule of law. It is not going to happen.

The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42008809">struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran</a> has created many geopolitical fault lines and Yemen is a fissure where the hot gases of hatred and distrust blow. The players that lurk behind in the shadows and the dust are too interested in the outcome going their way. It is a much bigger issue than a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423">civil war in Yemen</a>. It is a struggle for dominance. All sides are committing international crimes to achieve that dominance.

From secret detention centers and excessive bombing perpetrated by Saudi led or backed forces, the pattern of lawlessness continues unabated. Overlay blockades and the resulting famine, Yemen is a cesspool of atrocity.

Aiding and abetting this struggle for geopolitical dominance are various Western countries that are making a killing (pardon the pun) supplying arms to the parties to the conflict that defines Yemen today. They sell these arms with the full knowledge that the arms are used against combatants and noncombatants as well, a violation of international law. That is aiding and abetting international crimes, which makes those nations individually criminally liable for those war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

Someday, but not now, there will be an accounting for the crimes perpetrated against the people of Yemen. When that time comes all parties, to include nations who sustain the conflict by selling arms to the combatants will have to account for their actions that have destroyed Yemen. Those crimes are crimes against us all.

		<title>NIFLA Decision Affirms First Amendment’s Purpose: Protect Minority Viewpoints</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An inherent feature of democracy is majority rule. And with that, as you may recall from civics, comes the risk of tyranny of the majority—the danger that a controlling popular viewpoint will oppress opposing views in society.

Foreseeing this, the Framers set up a number of constitutional mechanisms to protect minority interests. Among these early institutional protections was the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>’s guarantee of free speech. It was written in absolute terms, for tyranny by the majority manifests on a slippery slope. What may start as a well-meaning effort by officials wishing to limit certain harmful messages can morph into a dangerous form of social control where the state banishes certain beliefs and ideas. To prevent this insidious creep, the First Amendment assures that all ideas must be freely permitted without censorship or prejudice from the government.

But that didn’t stop the California Legislature in 2015 from imposing its pro-abortion passions on ideological opponents: pro-life, nonprofit pregnancy care centers. California did this by doing what the First Amendment says it cannot: by mandating that these pro-life groups speak messages to which they conscientiously object. Under penalty of crippling fines, the state attempted to, as Justice Clarence Thomas put it in his majority opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3205960953015849809&amp;q=national+institute+of+family+and+life+advocates+v.+becerra+&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006"><em>National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra</em></a>, “<a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/9990">co-opt these facilities to deliver its message</a>” promoting abortion.

Specifically, AB 775, titled the “<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB775">Reproductive FACT Act</a>,” required licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to make conspicuous written announcements—in specific words dictated by the state—telling women how to obtain low-cost abortions. The law also forced non-medical pregnancy care centers to place <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/CalifReproductiveFactActSampleAd.png">lengthy state-crafted disclaimers</a> in all their advertisements, suggesting that the centers were unqualified to provide the free non-medical support services they offer.

Taken together, the act’s two operative provisions required these pro-life charities to affirmatively make negative implications about themselves and to point women to abortion, contradicting the very reason these centers exist. The centers’ volunteers and staff obviously bore deep moral objections to speaking either compelled message.

California was not subtle about the tyranny it was orchestrating. Legislators went on record stating that they were indeed intending to target pro-life pregnancy care centers, noting that these centers “unfortunately” exist throughout the state and encourage pregnant women to choose life for their babies. Legislators openly contrasted the centers’ pro-life message with California’s own “proud legacy” of liberal abortion laws.

The act itself contained a series of complicated exemptions, leaving the provisions compelling speech applicable exclusively to pro-life speakers at these pro-life nonprofits. In this way, an overbearing government gerrymandered the legislation to drown out a particular point of view it didn’t want its citizens to hear.

When pregnancy care centers challenged the law, California shied away from its bald targeting of pro-life views and claimed instead that it was mostly trying to get information out. The compelled speech was justified, the state argued because pregnant women in California need to know about where to get medical services. What the state couldn’t explain, though, is why it would commandeer only certain pro-life nonprofits to spread the abortion message. That’s a rather ineffective method for a public information campaign. And it reeks of viewpoint animus.

After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/16-1140-op-bel-9th-cir.pdf">upheld the law in <em>NIFLA</em></a>, the U.S. Supreme Court saw the Reproductive FACT Act for what it was: a content-based speech regulation that “imposes a government-scripted, speaker-based disclosure requirement.” Because the act compelled speech, it forced speakers to alter the content of their speech. And absent sufficient justification, of which none was offered here by any stretch, content-based speech burdens cannot survive. It is a longstanding and simple constitutional rule, and the high court applied it straightforwardly to invalidate the act.

The beauty of the majority opinion in <em>NIFLA</em> is that it does not rest on the targeting of ideological opponents. Instead, it goes back to the broader principle that the mere possibility of silencing minority views is enough to prohibit speech regulations.

Compelled speech is anathema to the Free Speech Clause, and the analysis need not go further. Anything less than full and automatic protection of speech would give states “a powerful tool to impose invidious discrimination of disfavored subjects.” Thus, Justice Thomas, writing for the majority, put in contemporary terms the principle that the Founding Fathers declared long ago: “[T]he people lose when the government is the one deciding which ideas should prevail.” And whether or not such discrimination is afoot in any particular case is immaterial; even the remote prospect of interfering with freedom of thought and belief renders a speech regulation impermissible.

The four-justice concurrence, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, hit harder on the government’s motives, calling California to task for undisguised viewpoint discrimination. The burdensome speech regulations on pro-life speakers, Kennedy wrote, indicated that “these individuals were targeted because of their beliefs.” And, equally concerning, the means California used to advance its “preferred message advertising abortions” ran headlong into the Free Speech Clause. Summing up the grave constitutional problem, the concurring justices delivered a quote we will surely be seeing again in future free speech cases: “Governments must not be allowed to force persons to express a message contrary to their deepest convictions.”

At bottom, <em>NIFLA v. Becerra </em>illustrates why we need the First Amendment’s protections in our democratic republic if individual thought and ideas are to flourish. The danger of censorship by those in power is real. This case also demonstrates the importance of a judiciary firmly committed to upholding these fundamental free speech principles—regardless who is speaking. Free speech is either for everyone, in all seasons, or it is illusory.

Let’s hope that the Supreme Court’s clear message in <em>NIFLA </em>marks a resounding warning shot to lower courts and state legislatures inclined to use government power to control the marketplace of ideas. Even the chance that certain views may be suppressed is enough to invoke the corrective protection of an American bedrock, the First Amendment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>O</strong>ur phones are constantly searching for the greatest connection, updating our location, and often connect to multiple cell towers on any given day, divulging our whereabouts to service providers with relative ease. In recent years, the accuracy of this method to pinpoint a person’s current and past location has increased significantly. And given that there are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/number-of-cell-phones-exceeds-us-population-ctia-trade-group/2011/10/11/gIQARNcEcL_blog.html?utm_term=.c73d8c3272a5">more cell phone</a> accounts in America than there are people in the country, wireless providers are the gatekeepers to a wealth of stored information about our daily movements.

Privacy advocates and those legitimately concerned with the attendant constraints of <em>Big Brother</em> government have looked to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf">Carpenter v. United States</a></u> as a major victory, as it settles several questions about the protections that citizens have when the government seeks to use third parties to access personal information such as location. The United States Supreme Court’s position on the essentialness of cell phones to everyday life and Americans’ expectation that the government is not tracking them at every moment, in many ways builds upon its decision in <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-132_8l9c.pdf">Riley v. California</a></u>. In <u>Riley</u>, the Court ruled that the contents of a cell phone found on a person may not be searched as a part of placing that individual under arrest, given the heavy expectations of privacy citizens have in the information that may be retrieved from a cell phone (in the case of David Riley, contacts and photos). Location data, in particular, can reveal intimate details about a person’s life, from visits to medical clinics, to attendance at community and political group gatherings, to trips to the liquor store.

It is hard to imagine that Timothy Carpenter, upon receiving a hundred and sixteen-year prison sentence, would have found the humor that some have found in the irony of his alleged string of store robberies involving cell phone theft, and law enforcement using cell phone technology to ultimately identify him. The Court in <u>Carpenter</u>, however, found this acquisition by the government of cell-site records from his wireless carriers was a Fourth Amendment search, requiring a warrant based upon probable cause, and granted his appeal of the conviction and sentence. Before Carpenter was identified by law enforcement as involved in the robberies of Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio, his cell phone number was found in the call log of another suspect. Federal prosecutors then made a request, without a warrant, to several wireless carriers and received over four months’ worth of cell-site records with location data. Law enforcement agents were able to connect Carpenter to the location of the robberies through triangulation methods that estimate a cell phone’s location within a cell site.

While the significance of this case cannot be overstated, there are many questions left unanswered by <u>Carpenter</u> concerning other methods of state surveillance in both corrections and policing. Interestingly, in articulating the concern in the case, the Court noted that “when the Government tracks the location of a cell phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an ankle monitor to the phone’s user.” Some may be surprised to discover that all fifty states do in fact attach electronic ankle monitors on hundreds of thousands of people every year as a condition of pretrial and post-conviction release. In a <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/-/media/assets/2016/10/use_of_electronic_offender_tracking_devices_expands_sharply.pdf">report</a> on the expansion of electronic surveillance, the Pew Charitable Trust notes that the use of electronic surveillance devices in the criminal justice system rose 140% between 2005 and 2015. During this same period, GEO Group and CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), private prison corporations, <a href="https://www.inthepublicinterest.org/fact-sheet-geo-group-and-corrections-corporation-of-america-spend-billions-of-taxpayer-dollars-purchasing-smaller-companies/">invested billions</a> of dollars in ankle monitor surveillance technology.

I highlight, in a recent law review <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195271">article</a>, how these correctional surveillance technologies are even used frequently on minors, in ways that compromise the rehabilitative aim of juvenile court. This form of surveillance has also been widely used in the immigration system through programs under innocuous titles such as “Family Case Management.” During the recent controversy over the policy of separating migrant parents from their children, such surveillance programming <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/obama-era-pilot-program-kept-asylum-seeking-migrant-families-together-n885896">was suggested</a> as a reasonable solution, at a minimal cost.

The potential for dehumanization that comes with locking tracking devices on adults and their children, not only presents psychological harms from stigma and shame, but may also act to widen the overcriminalization net, entrenching a marginalized, subordinated class of individuals with digital scarlet letters. We are only beginning to examine the deep social costs of this expanded carceral reality, best understood as e-carceration. But what we already know is that its <a href="http://progressive.org/magazine/black-america-s-state-surveillance/">burden falls heaviest on poor communities of color</a>.

Thus, one of the questions that is not addressed by <em>Carpenter</em> is whether this ruling opens the door for new interpretations on how the location data collected by correctional surveillance technology, such as ankle monitors, should be protected. In <u><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-593_o7jq.pdf">Grady v. North Carolina</a></u>, in a case involving the use of GPS ankle monitors on sex offenders, the Supreme Court decided that the state “conducts a [Fourth Amendment] search when it attaches a device to a person’s body, without consent, for the purpose of tracking that individual’s movements.” Although at pretrial and post-conviction release individuals voluntarily consent to be monitored, the Court in <u>Carpenter</u> noted that when it comes to the location data that cell phones provide, the “voluntary exposure” rationale does not hold up. One could ask whether those on ankle monitors, which are <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/20/set-fail/impact-offender-funded-private-probation-poor">increasingly supervised by private for-profit probation companies</a>, voluntarily expose their location data when the option presented is imprisonment or “near perfect surveillance.” And like Timothy Carpenter, individuals on ankle monitors risk having their location data used to <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/ankle-monitor-links-suspect-to-crimes/287680530">place them at the scenes of crimes</a>, without the need for a search warrant.

Questions also remain for the extent of constitutional protections that may be afforded against newer forms of police surveillance technology. The type of location data used to convict Timothy Carpenter has been used in criminal cases for at least twenty years. In the now infamous <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-who-is-adnan-syed-20180329-story.html">murder case of Adnan Syed</a> for the 1999 killing of Hae Min Lee, which is chronicled on the <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/season-one">Serial</a> podcast, cell site data garnered by nearby cell towers was a significant piece of evidence use by prosecutors in the February 2000 trial. The Supreme Court has been notoriously slow in catching up to the speed of advancing surveillance technology in policing. In just the past few years police departments have acquired highly sophisticated modes of surveillance such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/technology/amazon-facial-recognition.html">facial recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xmmvy/why-does-hartford-have-so-many-cameras-precrime">pre-crime software</a> technology that makes algorithm-generated predictions on who is likely to commit crime and where. These technologies have already received considerable <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/the-underlying-bias-of-facial-recognition-systems/476991/">criticism</a> for their inherent racial biases and disproportionate <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/predictive-policing-reform_us_57c6ffe0e4b0e60d31dc9120">impacts</a> on communities of color.

If the Supreme Court in 2018 believes that the arguably rudimentary technology of ankle monitoring is near perfect, then the current law enforcement foray into the wildly powerful, yet flawed, surveillance measures of the future, may present frightening possibilities for limiting privacy and maximizing social control of vulnerable communities. And given the pace of the jurisprudence in this area, these fundamental concerns are not likely to reach the highest court for quite some time.

Most advocates fearing the encroaching surveillance state recognize that courts may not be the best route for pushing back against current police and correctional surveillance measures. The recent Supreme Court nomination, with Brett Kavaughn’s <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/brett-kavanaughs-views-on-privacy-are-alarmingly-outdated-for-the-digital-age.html">purported stance on privacy</a>, will likely only lessen any confidence for increasing protections through litigation. Instead, advocates have focused on building local and national movements for change. For example, in corrections, the Center for Media Justice launched the “<a href="http://centerformediajustice.org/our-projects/challengingecarceration-electronic-monitoring/">Challenging E-Carceration</a>” project to contest the use of electronic ankle monitoring in the criminal justice and immigration system as a human rights issue, and released a set of <a href="http://centerformediajustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/electronic-monitoring-guidelines-final.pdf">guidelines</a> to support advocates and policymakers. In policing, the American Civil Liberties Union introduced the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/community-control-over-police-surveillance">Community Control Over Police Surveillance</a> (CCOPS) effort. The campaign’s principal objective is to pass <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/communitycontrol/ACLU-Local-Surveillance-Technology-Model-City-Council-Bill-January-2017.pdf">CCOPS laws</a> that ensure the elevation of residents’ voice and input into law enforcement decisions about the adoption and deployment of surveillance technologies. Even corporate <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/18/technology/amazon-facial-recognition/index.html">shareholders have organized</a> to raise concerns over surveillance technologies.

These new debates and movements reveal that we are only at the tip of the enhanced state surveillance iceberg. The toughest battles in balancing the risks and rewards of such technologies lie ahead. Perhaps the most important question left unresolved by <em>Carpenter</em> is not how we should use surveillance technologies, but rather whether some forms of surveillance technology should be used at all.

		<title>After Helsinki: US Abandons Legal Obligations in Syria</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>A</strong>mong several noteworthy and interrelated Helsinki summit policy derelictions - most obviously, Vladimir Putin's still unpunished <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/a-deeply-concerned-obama-warns-russia-against-action-in-crimea/2014/03/01/c56ca34c-a111-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.072400e7bd5c">aggressions in Crimea</a> - US President Donald Trump chose to ignore America's binding legal obligations regarding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/middleeast/syria-russia-un-war-crimes.html">Russian war crimes in Syria</a>. This sorely evident disregard reflects not "merely" willful antipathy to pertinent international law, but also a concurrent indifference to certain primary laws of the United States. In essence, this effectively dual-level violation exists because US law incorporates the preexisting <em>law of nations</em>, whether directly (either by express Constitutional requirement, or by specific Supreme Court ruling) or by the more general but equally authoritative convergence of various customary legal norms. The express Constitutional requirement or specific Supreme Court rulings are seen especially especially in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI of the US Constitution</a> (the "Supremacy Clause") and two prominent cases from the US Supreme Court: <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">Paquete Habana</a></em> (1900) and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/517/542/2386834/"><em>Tel Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic</em></a> (1984).

Significantly, both forms of domestic incorporation are vital, incontestable and immutable. This conclusion follows directly from the explicit terms of <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">Article 38 of the 1945 </a><em>Statute of the International Court of Justice.</em>

Under mutually reinforcing rules of national and international law - rules that are known more formally as "peremptory" or "<em>jus cogens"</em> norms because they permit "no derogation" - an American president simply has no recognizable right to ignore egregious Russian war crimes committed against Syrian civilians. This absolute prohibition extends to literally any conceivable reason or pretext for such indifference, including even the "traditional" presumption of geopolitical advantages expectedly accruing to the United States. Among other relevant documents, the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">US <em>Declaration of Independence</em></a> codifies a social contract that sets limits on the power of <em>any</em> government, including the operational powers of war waging. Accordingly, because justice, which is ultimately based on "natural law," commits all human society, those specific rights articulated by the <em>Declaration </em>can never be reserved exclusively to Americans.

Of necessity, they must extend to <em>all</em> human societies.

However much it is unrecognized in the current White House, this is still "the law." For Mr. Trump to suggest otherwise, as he did at Helsinki, if "only" by omission, is both illogical and self-contradictory. By definition, after all, any such injurious suggestion could nullify the immutable and universal <em>law of nature</em> from which the <em>Declaration</em> and all subsequent US law necessarily derive.

Precious few Americans are even remotely aware of this basic history or its corollary jurisprudence, but both facts and law remain valid nonetheless. Furthermore, as just a matter of usefully specific history, the actual conveyance of natural law thinking into American Constitutional theory was largely the work of <a href="http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf">John Locke's <em>Second Treatise on Civil Government. </em></a>In view of our current jurisprudential concerns, this particular history warrants some distinct and entirely visible respect.

Back in 1776, a then future American president named Thomas Jefferson relied upon this <em>Treatise</em> to craft his own <em>Declaration of Independence. </em>Significantly, can anyone seriously maintain today that US President Donald Trump has any idea about John Locke or his influence upon national and world law (or, for that matter, about even Thomas Jefferson)?

Now, in all important matters of national legal obligation, history deserves some recognizable pride of place. While fellow seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes regarded the natural law and civil law as coextensive, Locke echoed a more than two thousand year tradition with his markedly contrary view. This critically opposite stance was that the civil law must be kept consistent with preexisting natural law, <em>always.</em> Moreover, regarding the related laws of war of international law, sometimes termed the <em>law of armed conflict</em> or <em>humanitarian international law</em>, obligatory respect for noncombatant populations in warfare goes back much further; indeed, as far as the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, especially the basic rules outlined in <em>Deuteronomy</em>.

For an American president, it is not enough to justify an apparent "ally's" war crimes because of mutually gainful geopolitical goals, e.g., the destruction of ISIS. Accepting the timeless legal maxim - <em>jus ex injuria non oritur </em>- "rights do not arise from wrongs" - Mr. Trump should finally attempt to grasp certain fundamental traditions and pertinent laws of his own country, and then proceed to acknowledge them as the only permissible standard for enforcing the civilizing laws of war. More broadly, the president also needs to understand these unchanging obligations as one part of the vastly more general obligation to support the international law of human rights.

Again, the basic principles of this even wider law are already incorporated into certain vibrant statutes of the United States. As one example, the US Department of State is required to enforce the universal human rights provisions mandated by sections 116 (d) and 502B(b) of the <a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Foreign%20Assistance%20Act%20Of%201961.pdf"><em>Foreign Assistance Act of 1961</em></a>, as amended.

For several years, Russian bombs have maimed and killed thousands of Syrian noncombatants, sometimes with chemical components, and always without even a hint of decent concern for compliance with the laws of war of international law. By failing to reference these persistently indiscriminate killings during his recent summit meeting with President Vladimir Putin at Helsinki, US President Donald Trump made the United States complicit in genuinely grievous international crimes. More precisely, he openly violated not only American jurisprudential obligations to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/"><em>UN Charter</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=24"><em>Hague</em></a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions"><em>Geneva Conventions</em></a>, and assorted longstanding rules of warfare concerning <em>discrimination</em> (sometimes called "distinction"), <em>proportionality</em> and <em>military necessity</em>, but he also managed to sully the closely related expectations of US law. In the final analysis, these multiple and coinciding Russian derelictions are significant not just because they express formal legal "delicts" or codified "wrongs," but because they inevitably bring very tangible and palpable suffering to wholly innocent human beings.

Following other once-unthinkable Helsinki summit concessions by Donald Trump, they already represent unforgivable crimes for which the United States must conspicuously accept a derivative but still-major responsibility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right"><em>To separate kids from their parents is an act that is so deplorable and so inhumane, it speaks to a complete corruption in morality of this administration. . .</em></p>
- <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-children-separated-1.4713984">Jagmeet Singh</a>, Canada's New Democratic Party Leader

<strong>T</strong>he US <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/world/americas/us-un-migrant-children-families.html">is violating its own human-rights obligations</a></span> through some of its recent immigration-related actions, most shockingly its removal of 3,000 (reported numbers have varied) immigrant children from their families. Other countries must now consider whether their continued support of the US makes them complicit. This post calls on Canada to rescind the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement. This agreement, explained more below, is based on an assumption that Canada and the US are equally safe countries for refugees, and recent actions by the US Government refute that assumption.

<strong>The US is increasingly unsafe for refugees. </strong>

US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his hostility towards immigrants, or at least towards certain immigrants, often using rhetoric around so-called “illegal immigrants” to describe people in different situations, including refugee claimants. His “Muslim Ban” has created major controversy, as the most recent iteration was just upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in <span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf">Trump v Hawaii</a></span>. Trump has made countless disturbing statements, such as when he <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-countries-trump/index.html">complained about </a></span>immigrants coming from “shithole countries.” The <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/politics/trump-immigration.html?_r=0">New York Times</a></span> reported that Trump had suggested that people coming from Haiti have AIDS, and that immigrants from Nigeria would never “go back to their huts,” both statements that the White House later denied. Earlier, Trump infamously <span><a href="http://time.com/4473972/donald-trump-mexico-meeting-insult/">said</a></span> “[w]hen Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best … They’re sending people that have lots of problems … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”

This last statement was made in support of <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump-wall/trump-will-seek-full-funding-soon-for-his-border-wall-idUSKCN1IH2XC">his notorious planned wall </a></span>along the US-Mexico Border. In the meantime, US officials have set up increasingly invasive <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/us/border-checkpoints.html">checkpoints</a></span>, often quite far from the US Border, in places like Maine and New Hampshire. People are being randomly stopped and ordered to produce proof of citizenship. In June 2018, Trump <span><a href="http://time.com/5320551/trump-immediate-deportation-no-court-hearing/">posted on Twitter</a></span> that people who entered the country “illegally” should be immediately deported, with no court proceedings.

Even against that chilling backdrop, the US Government’s removal of <span><a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180713221119-w34tn/">nearly 3,000</a></span> children, under its “<span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-announces-zero-tolerance-policy-criminal-illegal-entry">Zero Tolerance Policy</a></span>,” sent shockwaves around the world. The facts have been widely reported, but they are facts that speak for themselves in terms of the horror of this policy. An <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/propublica-audio-tape-purportedly-of-sobbing-immigrant-kids-grabs-spotlight/">audiotape</a></span> of children, purportedly some of those taken from their parents and crying in distress, was widely circulated. Images of groups of <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">children in cages</a></span>, with foil sheets and sleeping on floor mats, sparked outrage. Older children were reportedly having to care for the younger children in cages with them, <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">including changing diapers</a></span>. In some cases, parents were given no notice, or were told their children were being taken for baths, and then the children were removed. One mother <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/07/us/separated-families-detention-conditions/index.html">says</a></span> she was told that the children were being taken away for “the crime of crossing the Border.” A <span><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/13/mom-says-baby-taken-breastfed-texas-immigration-detention-center">breast-feeding baby</a></span> was reported removed from her mother, who was handcuffed for resisting the removal. It is not clear if this was the same mother <span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/11/as_trump_admin_misses_deadline_to">who testified </a></span>that she had been raped by the police in her native country and had fled after they threatened to kill her and her family. Her children, including one who was still breast-feeding, were taken, and she was so distraught about the separation that she was having difficulty articulating her refugee claim. A reporter who witnessed this testimony confirmed that no distinction was being made, under this policy, for refugee claimants, who were separated from their children, criminally charged, and only then given the opportunity to make their claims.

Another mother said that, when her toddler was returned to her after 85 days, he was <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/07/us/separated-families-detention-conditions/index.html">dirty and full of lice</a></span>, as if he had not been bathed the entire time – this incident happened a few months before the Zero-Tolerance Policy was announced. As controversy over family separations raged, the Government announced plans to erect <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">tent cities</a></span> in the desert, where the temperature regularly reaches 100 F/40 C, to hold hundreds of children.

Rachel Maddow, of MSNBC, <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/20/rachel-maddow-breaks-down-in-tears-on-air-while-reading-report-on-tender-age-shelters/?utm_term=.8a1b7d001ded">became emotional and could not continue</a></span> when reporting that children as young as infants were to be sent to places called “Tender Age” facilities. The trauma to the children is substantial, with one person describing a three-year-old boy, who was waiting to be reunited with his family, as “<span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/10/politics/family-reunifications-july-10-deadline/index.html">just a shell of himself</a></span>.” A four-year-old girl from Guatemala, who had been cared for by other children in her cell, was so traumatized that she was not speaking and was “<span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">just curled up in a little ball</a></span>.” The <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44518942">American Academy of Pediatrics</a></span> warned that the trauma of the separation could cause permanent damage. Children thus separated have been required to <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/30/politics/children-in-court/index.html">appear alone</a></span> in immigration court (although this is not a new scenario for unaccompanied minors).

The Government initially defended this practice. Attorney General Jeff Sessions went so far as to <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/opinions/jeff-sessions-misreads-bible-to-justify-separating-families-moss/index.html">cite the Bible</a></span> as justification for the separations. Trump did finally sign an <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/affording-congress-opportunity-address-family-separation/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wh">Executive Order</a></span> in late June, stopping further separations (although the Order was controversial for other reasons), after encountering substantial condemnation. Two days after he signed the Executive Order, Trump tried to change the focus to different families – appearing with parents whose children were killed, some in traffic accidents, by “<span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/622540331/fact-check-trump-illegal-immigration-and-crime">illegal</a></span>” immigrants. In apparent response to the outrage over his separation of families, Trump <span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1010156224749408258">tweeted</a></span> “[w]e cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief."

It took a federal court judge to force the Government to work towards reunifying the families already separated. On June 26, the <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/family-separation-reunion-hurdles/index.html">court ordered</a></span> the Government to provide telephone communications by July 6. All children under age five were ordered reunited by July 10, and the remaining children were ordered reunified by July 26. Another court <span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/11/as_trump_admin_misses_deadline_to">order</a></span> required the Government to release children <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/politics/trump-administration-catch-and-release-migrants.html">after 20 days</a></span>. The Government <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/politics/trump-administration-catch-and-release-migrants.html">complained</a></span> that the combined effect of these orders was to require them to release the families.

Government officials clearly had no reunification plan and had not even bothered to track the children it removed, with <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/migrant-children-chaos-family-separation.html">reports</a></span> that they were using DNA to determine which children belonged to which parents, after records went missing, and, in some cases, were destroyed. Some of the parents had <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/family-separation-reunion-hurdles/index.html">already been deported</a></span> without their children. Other parents had been released, with the Government apparently not tracking <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/family-separation-reunion-hurdles/index.html">where they went</a></span>. The Government was unable to meet the <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/10/politics/family-reunifications-july-10-deadline/index.html">short-term deadlines</a></span> set by the court. In asking for more time, the <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/family-separation-reunion-hurdles/index.html">Government said</a></span> it was necessary "given the complexities involved in locating individuals who have been removed, determining whether they wish to be reunified with their child, and facilitating such a reunification outside of the United States." On July 10, the judge had to remind the Government that the deadlines were “<span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/11/as_trump_admin_misses_deadline_to">not aspirational goals</a></span>.” The Government tried to require the families to pay reunification costs, and again the US court intervened, <span><a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20180713221119-w34tn/">ordering</a></span> the government to pay. On July 16, the judge <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/family-separations-border-reunification/index.html">temporarily paused</a></span> deportations of families after reunification, as the American Civil Liberties Union expressed concern over information that mass deportations of reunited families were planned.

US Government officials have congratulated themselves on their <span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/politics/family-separation-reunion-hurdles/index.html">concern for the children’s welfare</a></span>. The slow pace of reunification, they said, was the result of their primary concern about the children. One official, after the reunification deadlines had been missed, <span><a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2018/7/11/as_trump_admin_misses_deadline_to">said</a></span>: “[i]t is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity, what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids who are smuggled into our country or come across illegally.” The Government <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/politics/trump-administration-catch-and-release-migrants.html">has also made</a></span> it clear that it is seeking new laws and ways around the court order. Trump is still showing no compassion for the traumatized children, and certainly no remorse for having separated families, <span><a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1016677333141524480">commenting</a></span> that the way to prevent families from being separated was not to come into the country illegally. It certainly should not be assumed that US immigration policy going forward will be any less cruel than it has been.

<strong>Neighbors Respond</strong>

What, then, is the responsibility of other countries? In June 2018, Mexico had a strong response, asking the United Nations to intervene, describing the family separations as “<span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-essential-washington-updates-mexico-asks-united-nations-to-intervene-1530238824-htmlstory.html">cruel and a violation of human rights</a></span>.”

Canada has had a more muted response. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has refused to heed <span><a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/news/us-less-safe-ever-refugees-evidence-filed-court-challenge-shows?utm_source=AmnestyNow&amp;utm_medium=TWITTER&amp;utm_campaign=I%20Welcome&amp;post_ID=1647498695">growing calls</a></span> to rescind an agreement with the US, called the <span><a href="http://www.treaty-accord.gc.ca/details.aspx?id=104943">Canada–United States Safe Third Country Agreement, officially the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries</a></span>. This agreement generally provides that refugee claimants must make their claims in the first of the two countries in which they arrive, with some exceptions, supposedly to stop forum shopping. Many claimants at the US- Canada Border are thus sent back to the US for disposition of their claims.

The Safe Third Country Agreement was signed while the Bush Administration’s torture program was in full swing and has <span><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canada-faces-mounting-pressure-to-end-safe-third-country-agreement-with-u-s-1.3984274">always been controversial</a></span>. That controversy has escalated since the Trump inauguration, as have the number of refugees crossing the US-Canada Border. <span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/seidu-mohammed-asylum-seeker-frostbitten-refugee-manitoba-1.4121034">Canadian media</a></span> have carried stories of people walking in winter into Quebec, some suffering terrible injuries from frostbite.

On June 18, 2018, as stories of the family-separation policy shocked the world, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially refused to criticize the policy, suggesting that doing so would be “<span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/06/18/trudeau-trump-child-migrant_a_23462117/">playing politics</a></span>,” and insisting that the US <span><a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/trudeau-condemns-u-s-separation-of-families-for-first-time-as-calls-mount-to-scrap-the-safe-third-country-agreement">remains a safe country for immigrants</a></span>. He also said that Canadians did not expect him to intervene.

Trudeau somewhat amended that position during a <span><a href="https://openparliament.ca/debates/2018/6/20/justin-trudeau-6/">heated exchange</a></span> in the House of Commons on June 20, 2018, after intense pressure regarding his prior comments. Even then, though, he expressed reluctance to take action, <span><a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/trudeau-condemns-u-s-separation-of-families-for-first-time-as-calls-mount-to-scrap-the-safe-third-country-agreement">telling reporters</a></span> that same day, “[w]e take action based on facts and not based on fears or worries …”

Member Jenny Kwan confronted Trudeau, <span><a href="https://openparliament.ca/debates/2018/6/20/justin-trudeau-6/">saying</a></span>: “… the fact is that over 2,000 migrant children are already in baby jails. The parents do not know where they are or when they will see them again ... Does the Prime Minister recognize that as long as Trump is in power, the US will never be a safe country for asylum seekers?”

Hours before Trump signed the Executive Order, Trudeau finally acknowledged that the US policy was “<span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-children-separated-1.4713984">wrong</a></span>.” During the exchange in Parliament, though, he remained vague about the Agreement, saying “[a]s I have said many times, the safe third country agreement (sic) is over 10 years old. We will continually look for ways to modernize it and be in conversation with the Americans on this. We will continue as well to closely monitor developments in the United States.”

Some <span><a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canada-must-end-its-safe-third-country-agreement-with-the-us/">speculate</a></span> that Trudeau is reluctant to take on this issue because he is dealing with an escalating trade dispute with the US That dispute, however, cannot overshadow Canada’s response to this distressing human-rights issue. <span><a href="https://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/imce/images/STCA%20FactumFINAL%20MAR27.pdf">Several organizations</a></span>, including Amnesty International, the Canadian Council for Refugees, and the Canadian Council of Churches, have filed a legal proceeding in Canadian federal court, ultimately seeking to force rescission of the agreement and providing <span><a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/sites/amnesty/files/STCA%20backgrounder%20july%202018%20-%20final.pdf">extensive and compelling evidence</a></span> that the US is not safe for refugees.

Concerns over US immigration policy are not new. The open hostility of the Trump administration to immigrants, including refugees, however, has led to devastating human-rights abuses. If children can be torn from their families, potentially permanently, and imprisoned, then the US is not safe for refugees. This policy is not the only reason the US is not safe, but it is enough of a reason on its own. By continuing to cling to a fiction to the contrary, Canada risks being complicit in those abuses. Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, said it well: "[t]o separate kids from their parents is an act that is so deplorable and so inhumane, it speaks to a complete corruption in morality of this administration."

Canada’s obligations are clear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>P</strong>resident Donald Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kavanaugh-nomination-kicks-off-parallel-fights-in-divided-senate-1531225802">nomination</a> of Judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh">Brett M. Kavanaugh</a> as Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court from a list of potential candidates has ignited <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2018/07/17/americans-divided-on-kavanaughs-nomination-to-the-supreme-court/">immediate support and criticism</a> from conservatives and liberals respectively.

An undergrad and <a href="https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/brett-kavanaugh-90-nominated-us-supreme-court">law</a> alum at Yale University, Judge Kavanaugh clerked for the departing Justice Anthony Kennedy, practiced law privately and at the U.S. Solicitor General’s office, and worked closely with independent counsel Kenneth Star (investigating President Clinton). After several years in the White House serving President George W. Bush, he was nominated in 2003 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by President Bush and subsequently confirmed by the Senate on May 26, 2006.

Neither his tenure on the appellate court nor his scholarly interests support a strong appreciation for core health and public health law issues. His court’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/07/11/the-health-202-kavanaugh-may-not-completely-gut-obamacare-if-he-makes-it-to-the-supreme-court/5b44f0e01b326b3348adde1b/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9d787cb9b886">limited jurisdiction</a> focused on federal legislative-regulatory issues have not produced a plethora of public health-related decisions. If confirmed, however, Judge Kavanaugh’s potential to directly and powerfully impact the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/politics/democrats-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html">health of millions of Americans</a> is unquestioned. In this commentary, we provide an initial assessment of Judge Kavanaugh’s actual or prospective views on multiple constitutional, health, and public health law and policy issues based primarily on his jurisprudence and scholarship.

<strong>Constitutional Conundrums </strong>

A self-proclaimed Constitutional <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/06/potential-nominee-profile-brett-kavanaugh/">originalist</a> and <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/from-the-bench-the-constitutional-statesmanship-of-chief-justice-william-rehnquist/">textualist</a>, Judge Kavanaugh summed up his “<a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/meet_brett_kavanaugh_trumps_nominee_for_the_supreme_court">judicial philosophy</a>” at his July 9<sup>th</sup> nomination ceremony. “A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. And a judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.”

These views are further clarified in his own scholarship. In a <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol89/iss5/1/">2014 address</a> at Notre Dame, Judge Kavanaugh touted how “[t]he precise text of the Constitution controls our structure. . . [We should] not ignore the text of the Constitution simply because it . . . may be outdated, or has not adapted to modern conditions.” Later, in <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/from-the-bench-the-constitutional-statesmanship-of-chief-justice-william-rehnquist/">2017</a>, he noted how the specific words of the Constitution “bind us as judges, legislators, and executive officials.” He likens the role of a judge to that of an <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4733&amp;context=ndlr">umpire</a> ascertaining a statute’s meaning “based on the words, context, and appropriate semantic canons of construction,” and less so on its <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2118-2163-Online.pdf">legislative history</a>. Innovative interpretations of constitutional rights are <a href="http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/From-the-Bench.pdf">inappropriate</a>, he suggested, unless such rights are “rooted in the nation’s history and tradition.”

Judge Kavanaugh <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol89/iss5/1/">aligns</a> principles of separation of powers and liberty to challenge the <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/assets/marquette-lawyers/pdf/marquette-lawyer/2016-fall/2016-fall-full.pdf">modern role</a> of independent executive agencies (among other issues). In <a href="http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/From-the-Bench.pdf">2017</a>, he lauded former Chief Justice Rehnquist for his role in “limiting the ability of agencies to make major policy decisions that belong to Congress” absent express legislative delegation. Recently, Judge Kavanaugh dissented in <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/B7623651686D60D585258226005405AC/$file/15-1177.pdf"><em>PHH Corp. v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</em></a> (2018), which upheld the constitutionality of the appointment of the Bureau’s director (who can be removed only for cause). He argued that “independent agencies pose a significant threat to individual liberty and to the constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances.”

He is an unabashed critic of the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/"><em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc</em></a>. (1984) allowing Congressional delegations of authority to federal agencies pursuant to articulated standards for issuance and enforcement of administrative regulations. In <a href="http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2118-2163-Online.pdf">2016</a> Judge Kavanaugh labeled <em>Chevron</em> deference a “textual invention by courts” representing “nothing more than a judicially orchestrated shift of power from Congress to the Executive Branch.” It is a position he backs up in his jurisprudence. As one health law attorney recently summed in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/us/politics/medicare-lawsuit-brett-kavanaugh.html">New York Times</a>, Judge Kavanaugh is not “inclined to rubber-stamp the actions of a government agency.” In fact, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/brett-kavanaugh-business-groups-trump-705800">White House</a> praised Judge Kavanaugh for overruling federal agency authority 75 times while on the bench. In a recent case, <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf"><em>U.S. Telecom Association v. FCC</em></a> (2017), for example, he argued that FCC’s net neutrality rule is unlawful due in part to a lack of Congressional authorization.

If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh’s constitutional views have the strong potential to steer the Court away from allowing meaningful governmental regulations in the interests of the public’s health and toward a pro-business model of limited governmental oversight. One upside of this is that Congress may have to absorb greater political accountability for failures to address core health and environmental issues.

The downside is that regulatory agencies like HHS, CMS, CDC, FDA, and EPA which Congress previously vested with achieving core health care and public health goals may be stymied in their ability to accomplish them. Coupled with Judge Kavanaugh’s unprecedented belief in the power of the Presidency, the end result constitutionally could be dire: <em>an all-powerful President overseeing feckless agencies under-powered by Congress to address the major health challenges confronting a nation</em>.

<strong>Health Law and Policy Challenges </strong>

Judge Kavanaugh’s positions on <a href="https://familiesusa.org/product/four-ways-our-health-care-risk-supreme-court-nomination-fight">multiple</a> health care-related legal battles are dominating discussions leading up to his confirmation hearings tentatively scheduled for early September. Nailing down his views on such topics is not easy. He has not extensively opined on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In his dissenting opinion in <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/055C0349A6E85D7A8525794200579735/$file/11-5047-1340594.pdf"><em>Seven-Sky v. Holder</em></a> (2011), Judge Kavanaugh argued that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7421">Tax Anti-Injunction Act</a> prohibited the court from ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate. In <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/8D88A83C3F0FA92C85257E9A00550930/$file/13-5202-1566781.pdf"><em>Sissel v. HHS</em></a> (2015), he dissented that the ACA complied with the Constitution’s <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag23_user.html">Origination Clause</a>. That same year, in <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/425C0AE29F10AFD785257E4B00767BF5/$file/13-5368.pdf"><em>Priests for Life v. HHS</em></a>, Judge Kavanaugh sought to rehear claims that ACA’s contraception coverage requirements violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA).

Judge Kavanaugh criticized the Supreme Court in a 2017 <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?436265-1/judge-brett-kavanaugh-speaks-separation-powers-2017">speech</a> for upholding the individual mandate pursuant to Congress’ powers to tax in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-393"><em>NFIB v. Sebelius</em></a><em> </em>(2012) despite rejecting Congress’ use of its Commerce powers. Dissenting justices in that case intimated that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and non-severable from the rest of ACA. Subsequently, President Trump signed the <span>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017</span>, arguably eliminating the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag26_user.html">taxing authority</a> underlying ACA’s individual mandate (effective 2019). Correspondingly, 20 state attorneys general have challenged ACA’s constitutionality in <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Texas_Wisconsin_et_al_v._U.S._et_al_-_ACA_Complaint_(02-26-18).pdf"><em>Texas v. U.S.</em></a> (2018). If this case is later heard before the Supreme Court featuring a newly-appointed Justice Kavanaugh, the Act in its entirety could be deemed unconstitutional.

Judge Kavanaugh’s record on other health care-related issues features varied results under similar methodology. He consistently applies narrow statutory readings often limiting executive agency determinations. In June 2018, he concurred in <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/17-5098/17-5098-2018-06-29.html"><em>Saint Francis Medical Center v. Azar</em></a> that HHS’s regulations limiting Medicare reimbursement challenges were “arbitrary and capricious.” In <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__caselaw.findlaw.com_us-2Ddc-2Dcircuit_1593485.html&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=l45AxH-kUV29SRQusp9vYR0n1GycN4_2jInuKy6zbqQ&amp;r=EcYDCA64GS88dC8UbgqxYS9BekLz9BPsdSOcMm_vjt8&amp;m=QX22hie0fCkpAR8gotWrdIZuYmfTMjXFSizmlM0kmsk&amp;s=aQn1nxFiepeKqYYB2dxOdaaMxFdKSXLooDfhXd17H7M&amp;e="><em>Hall v. Sebelius</em></a><em> </em>(2017), Judge Kavanaugh stated that “[t]here is no statutory avenue [for Medicare beneficiaries] to disclaim their legal entitlement” to Medicare Part A benefits. In <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cadc.uscourts.gov_internet_opinions.nsf_703B4EE4E36D793185257D5F0050F267_-24file_13-2D5139-2D1514181.pdf&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=l45AxH-kUV29SRQusp9vYR0n1GycN4_2jInuKy6zbqQ&amp;r=EcYDCA64GS88dC8UbgqxYS9BekLz9BPsdSOcMm_vjt8&amp;m=DHIZ7uUHkv3vVmO6etGgacVaReIN44hlSi4DvBB3Usc&amp;s=5-O8FZEx0EYZ9PpOxeV2pZ6MklcD6RTN2V9X9-TuKFY&amp;e="><em>Ivy Sports Med., LLC v. Burwell</em></a> (2014), he ruled that FDA cannot rely on its inherent reconsideration authority to circumvent statutory processes when revoking a product’s prior approval.

In perhaps his most widely-criticized opinion on the D.C. Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh joined a three-judge panel in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7032953363014972270&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Garza v. Hargan</em></a> (2017) to order the delay of abortion care for an undocumented minor in federal custody. The court sought to allow more time for HHS to expeditiously determine an immigration sponsor. When the minor petitioned for a rehearing, the court <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C81A5EDEADAE82F2852581C30068AF6E/$file/17-5236-1701167.pdf">vacated</a> its prior order. Judge Kavanaugh admonishes the court in dissent for creating a “radical . . . new right to immediate abortion on demand” for undocumented immigrant minors in federal detention.

<strong>Promoting the Public’s Health </strong>

Judge Kavanaugh’s holdings in select cases on food labeling, guns, and the environment reveal positions inapposite to protecting and promoting the public’s health and safety.

In <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/49B19BD894B52C1E852574400046ED41/$file/06-7148a.pdf"><em>Mills v. Giant of Maryland</em></a> (2007), he rejected a class-action tort liability claim by a group seeking lactose intolerant warning labels on milk packages. “Tort law does not provide protection from the obvious or ‘widely known’ risks of consuming a particular food,” suggests Judge Kavanaugh, “otherwise, a variety of food manufacturers as well as stadiums, bars, restaurants, convenience stores, and hot dog stands throughout the country would be liable to millions . . . every day.” Though criticizing what he (and others) may consider a frivolous claim, Judge Kavanaugh discounts the critical role that tort-based class actions play in advancing public health. Yet the very entities he worries about as “liable to millions” are in fact responsible for providing safe consumables for Americans every day. His questioning of the viability of tort litigation in public health promotion is concerning against the backdrop of ongoing litigation against <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/15/six-attorney-generals-opioid-lawsuits/612721002/">opioid manufacturers</a> and other big industries.

Balancing individual rights with public health harms is the essence of solid constitutional jurisprudence. In relation to gun control laws and policies, however, Judge Kavanaugh takes an alternative view. In a 2011 <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/DECA496973477C748525791F004D84F9/$file/10-7036-1333156.pdf">dissenting opinion</a>, he recognized D.C.’s “longstanding problem of gun violence” and “public safety motivation” when considering a local law limiting access to semi-automatic rifles. Still he would have adjudged D.C.’s law unconstitutional under his <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guns-ban/appeals-court-upholds-dc-semi-automatic-rifle-ban-idUSTRE7936RW20111004">broad interpretation</a> of 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">precedent</a>.

Judge Kavanaugh’s <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/meet_brett_kavanaugh_trumps_nominee_for_the_supreme_court">commitment</a> to textual statutory interpretation has stagnated efforts to promote healthy environments. In 2012, he struck down EPA rules regulating emissions for upwind states in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17833444888230748743&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>E.M.E. Homer City Generation v. EPA</em></a>, arguing the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-text">Clean Air Act</a> does not permit the rules. Judge Kavanaugh later sided with EPA when its standards were challenged as insufficient. In <a href="http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2014/20140411_docket-11-1423_opinion.pdf"><em>Communities for a Better Environment v. EPA</em></a> (2013), he found EPA’s choice not to update its rules on carbon monoxide was within its statutory authority despite environmental groups’ concerns that the rules “were inadequate to protect the public health and would cause adverse health effects . . ..”
<p style="text-align: center">________</p>
The impacts on health care, public health, and safety of the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh to the Court cannot be fully gauged given his limited experience and lack of relevant jurisprudence. As with any Justice, his positions may continue to evolve and change as he faces increasingly pressing cases with high stakes for Americans’ health. To the extent, however, that Judge Kavanagh votes consistent with his known pro-business, anti-regulatory, and limited rights views, the future of health law and policy may predictably shift far afield from existing public health goals and objectives.

		<title>Regulation of Virtual Currencies and Initial Coin Offerings in the Philippines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Advisory <a href="http://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018Advisory_FreedomTradersClubamdPloutosCoin.pdf">reiterated its message</a> to those conducting Initial Coin Offerings (“ICO”) of security tokens within the country: register your security tokens or be prepared to face penalties.

Just this month, the SEC <a href="https://bitpinas.com/news/sec-issues-warning-ploutos-coin-freedom-traders-club/">declared</a> that the Ploutos Coin is a kind of security which must be registered first in accordance with the Philippine Securities Regulation Code (“<a href="http://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Securities_Regulation_Code_RA8799.pdf">SRC</a>”) before it can be offered to the public. The Ploutos Coin was created and promoted by the Freedom Traders Club as an investment vehicle whose value will allegedly skyrocket through its projected supply and demand.

However, being an unregistered security, the SEC advised the public to exercise caution before investing in the said ‘coin’. It also warned that those who facilitate, aide, or abet in the sale or promotion of the Ploutos coin could face criminal penalties under the SRC and other criminal laws.

The SEC’s characterization of the Ploutos Coin as a kind of security was made on the basis of the <a href="https://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html">Howey Test</a> – a test derived from <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12975052269830471754&amp;q=sec+v+howey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">U.S. jurisprudence</a> – to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a security classified as an investment contract. The Howey Test has four requisites, namely: the investment of money; a common enterprise; the expectation of profit; and an increase in value primarily derived from the efforts of others. Thus, a token or coin that satisfies all the requisites of the Howey Test must secure a prior registration and license to engage in the sale of securities from the SEC. In such case, a registration statement and prospectus may be required prior to the ICO, unless exemptions under the SRC apply.

This, however, only applies to ICOs offering security tokens which are clearly within the SEC's regulatory purview.

<strong>The Rise of ICOs in the Philippines</strong>

A novel method of raising capital, the ICO gained momentum following the meteoric rise of the blockchain technology and of cryptocurrencies. Similar to an Initial Public Offering or an “IPO”, an ICO is also a method of raising capital for startup companies. However, unlike subscribing to shares of stock in a company, the SEC, in its <a href="http://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018Advisory_InitialCoinOffering.pdf">Advisory</a> issued in January 2018, defined an ICO as the first sale and issuance of a new virtual currency to the public usually for the purpose of raising capital for startup companies or of funding independent projects.

Because of its accessibility and wide applicability, several Philippine-based startups have dipped their toes into ICOs as innovative capital-raising vehicles. However, due to the lack of clear and specific laws and regulatory issuances about ICOs, it comes as no surprise that most of these startups have opted to conduct their ICOs outside the Philippines and in more crypto-friendly jurisdictions.

<strong>How to Conduct an ICO</strong>

Conducting an ICO is a complex and new process. A company that intends to conduct an ICO very often starts with a whitepaper, which typically contains all the necessary and credible information about the coin or token’s technical processes. Good white papers also reveal the management team, legal structure, and corporate organization of the ICO proponent.

A company launching an ICO is expected to transparently set forth all details about their financial plan and implementation timeline. They must also aim to comply with the highest level of technical protocols and relevant financial market regulations of jurisdictions where they intend to introduce their coins or tokens. Furthermore, a clear and full assessment of the risks related to the technology underlying their coin or token is usually disclosed. More often than not, such company must also engage a (preferably independent) technology auditor who can certify the technology’s high level of protection and transparency before ICO investors.

<strong>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</strong>

Having a good grasp of cryptocurrencies will be key to understanding ICOs. A cryptocurrency, or alternatively, virtual currency, is essentially a form of decentralized digital currency recorded in a distributed public ledger more popularly known as the ‘blockchain’. In the same January 2018 Advisory, the SEC defined a virtual currency as a digital representation of value issued and controlled by its developers and used and accepted by and among members of a specific community. These cryptocurrencies, tokens, or digital coins, can be acquired or exchanged through a Virtual Currency Exchange (“Exchange”) platform.

In relation to ICOs, the SEC likewise stated its view that some of the virtual currencies in the market, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding their issuance, follow the nature of a security as defined under the SRC, similar to the Ploutos Coin. As such, there is a possibility that a company intending to conduct an ICO offering security tokens will be required by the SEC to first register its virtual currencies in compliance with securities law. The SEC has not, however, expressed its view on how to treat utility tokens.

Unlike security tokens, utility tokens are arguably not the same as security tokens. In contrast to security tokens, they do not primarily derive their value or gain profit from mere holding of the tokens as the potential earnings are not tied to the growth or market value of the issuing company. Typically, the main use of utility tokens, as the name suggests, is to allow access and use of certain products and services on a platform to token holders. As such, utility tokens, arguably, do not fall under the same boat as security tokens which require SEC registration and licensing. However, a SEC determination to this effect has yet to be made.

<strong>The Philippine Approach to ICOs and Cryptocurrencies</strong>

While the SEC and <a href="http://www.bsp.gov.ph/">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</a> (“Central Bank”) or the Central Bank of the Philippines have yet to produce substantive regulations specifically and directly applicable to ICOs and cryptocurrencies, following direct consultations with key officials, both government agencies have shown their openness and willingness to act as enablers for blockchain initiatives in general and for ICO proponents in particular.

The SEC has expressed a willingness to take on a “sandbox approach” with respect to blockchain startups and their ICOs. This validates the SEC’s current policy posture to process and not outright reject or deny such applications, provided that threshold issues concerning legitimacy (or absence of fraudulent activity) are hurdled.

Central Bank regulators have similarly expressed the view that they are approaching virtual currencies and Exchanges on a “test and learn” basis, which means that regulators ought to welcome innovative activity first before formulating and applying regulations onto that activity. In its <a href="http://www.bsp.gov.ph/downloads/regulations/attachments/2017/c944.pdf">Memorandum Circular 944</a> (Series of 2017) which sets forth its current regulatory posture on virtual currencies, the Central Bank recognized Exchanges as a revolutionary method of delivering financial services and facilitating payment systems throughout the country. For this reason, the Central Bank classified Exchanges as services similar to remittance and transfer companies who fall within its regulatory purview. As a caveat, the Central Bank stressed that it only aims to regulate virtual currencies when used for delivery of financial services, particularly, for payments and remittances, that is, when there is an actual exchange from virtual currency to fiat or legal tender and vice versa.

However, the Central Bank has emphasized in its <a href="http://www.bsp.gov.ph/publications/media.asp?id=4575">Advisory on the Use of Virtual Currencies</a> issued on December 29, 2017 that it does not aim to endorse particular virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, as they are not backed by any central bank guarantee or by any underlying asset or commodity. It also advised the public to deal only with Central Bank-registered Exchanges and to maintain sufficient amounts of virtual currencies to address transaction requirements.

On the part of the private sector, the Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. (“PSE”) has yet to issue an official statement on cryptocurrencies and/or ICOs in general or on whether it will classify and admit cryptocurrencies in the exchange as an entirely new asset class.

<strong>The Philippines as a Tech Incubator</strong>

The Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (“CEZA”) is an economic zone <a href="http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno7922.htm#.W1c_dvlKiM8">established by law</a> with a mandate to stimulate economic growth by developing a self-sustaining industrial, commercial, financial, and tourism-recreational center. As a Freeport, it operates as a separate customs territory. The CEZA promotes itself by seizing new business opportunities through the provision of attractive incentives and advantages for interested investors who register in its economic zone. Showing the Philippine Government’s openness to this technology, the CEZA has entered into twenty-two agreements with offshore FinTech and blockchain companies which are interested in operating in the special economic zone and which intend to engage in crypto-mining, blockchain production, and the Exchanges.

		<title>International Religious Freedom Summit Fails to Mask Trump’s Scorn for Human Rights</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>F</strong>rom degrading disabled people, women, LGBT individuals, and other minorities to the forsaking of the United Nation Human Rights Council, and from separating migrant families to the coddling of authoritarians and racists, this presidency consistently ridicules human rights. It follows that the State Department's first <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm">international conference to Advance Religious Freedom</a> might trigger a collective cognitive dissonance. The event, billed as gathering mainly "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/politics/us-religious-freedom-pompeo/index.html">like-minded</a>" foreign counterparts, intended to reaffirm international commitments to promote religious freedom and produce "<a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm">real, positive change</a>." But a closer look suggests that in the case of religious freedom, the current administration is only perpetuating a longer history of ambivalence, and that this fundamental right, despite a high-profile summit, is no less a victim of President Trump’s antipathy towards human rights.

The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/2431">1998 International Religious Freedom Act</a>, or IRFA, signaled the first formal effort to incorporate religious freedom into U.S. foreign policy. IRFA required the president to designate and act against “Countries of Particular Concern”—those states engaging in or tolerating particularly severe violations of religious freedom. Since then,<a href="http://www.uscirf.gov/reports-briefs/annual-report/2018-annual-report"> only 14 countries of nearly 200</a> have ever been designated as CPCs. Moreover, this list has remained mostly static over time. Of the current ten CPC-designated countries, Burma, China, Iran and Sudan were added to the original list issued in 1999. Another four countries—Eritrea, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan—were added early in the last decade. Only two countries—Tajikistan and Turkmenistan—recently joined the CPC list in 2014 and 2016 respectively. This extreme selectivity is laid bare when juxtaposed with the consistently higher number of countries recommended for CPC status by the <a href="http://www.uscirf.gov/">U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)</a>, a bipartisan watchdog created by IRFA. Earlier this year, for example, <a href="http://www.uscirf.gov/reports-briefs/annual-report/2018-annual-report">USCIRF recommended</a> that six additional countries be designated as CPCs: Central African Republic, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam.

More telling than the few designated CPCs, is the consistent unwillingness to act against them. IRFA affords a menu of actions to signal displeasure with foreign governments violating religious freedom. But no president has authorized new, IRFA-based sanctions, <a href="http://www.uscirf.gov/reports-briefs/annual-report/2010-annual-report">except against Eritrea</a>. Rather, existing sanctions have been "double-hatted" to satisfy IRFA's requirements. Even then, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/01/11/2018-00333/secretary-of-states-determination-under-the-international-religious-freedom-act-of-1998">nearly half of the current CPCs have evaded</a> sanctions through indefinite presidential waivers invoked to safeguard "important" national interests. Consequently, Saudi Arabia, whose government the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2017&amp;dlid=281004#wrapper">State Department acknowledges</a> “does not allow the public practice of any non-Muslim religion,” has never been subject to sanction under IRFA.

In response to these and other shortcomings, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ281/PLAW-114publ281.pdf">Congress successfully enacted amendments</a> to IRFA in the waning days of President Obama's second term. But negotiation and implementation of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, named after Rep. Frank Wolf who spearheaded IRFA's original passage, reveals as much about Congress' ambivalence promoting international religious freedom as it does President Trump's. The original Wolf Act as introduced sought to elevate the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom and the State Department’s Office of International Religious Freedom from bureaucratic anonymity and into the Secretary of State’s office. The amendments also directed the president to appoint an adviser on international religious freedom to the National Security Council (NSC) and to create new NSC committees that would ensure significant policy input roles for the advisor and the Ambassador at Large. Further, they restricted the president’s ability to indefinitely waive sanctions against designated CPCs and guaranteed minimum funding for programs promoting international religious freedom. Finally, the original amendments took aim at groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida, by proposing a mechanism that would enable IRFA to scrutinize nonstate actors and require presidential sanctions against those found to be violating religious freedom.

Negotiations over two years left the above <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1150/actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+1150%22%5D%7D&amp;r=7">provisions either diluted or omitted</a>. Thus, while Congress secured some needed enhancements for IRFA, its final amendments declined to relocate the Ambassador at Large and its associated office, ruled out mandatory additions to the NSC, omitted meaningful limitations on the president’s waiver ability, and eliminated minimum funding for religious freedom promotion. In addition, not only was IRFA’s new ability to scrutinize “nonstate actors” significantly restricted, but it also relinquished obligating the president to act against them where designated as an “entity of particular concern” (EPC).

Turning back to the current administration, its implementation of an upgraded IRFA evidences no meaningful interest in advancing international religious freedom. President Trump chose to leave the post of Ambassador at Large vacant until his controversial nomination of Sam Brownback in July 2017. Brownback's polarized confirmation process required an additional six-month delay and necessitated a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-brownback-religious-freedom-ambassador-20180124-story.html">tie-breaking vote</a> by Vice President Pence in the Senate. Beyond this sluggish start, the administration has opted to maintain the same <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/06/2016-29171/secretary-of-states-determination-under-the-international-religious-freedom-act-of-1998">CPC designationas, same sanctions, and same waivers</a> as the previous administration.

More telling still, the Trump administration has failed to embrace any of IRFA’s recent enhancements or taken the initiative to unilaterally implement important changes that were ultimately dropped from the final version of the Wolf Act. For example. the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/03/09/2018-04718/secretary-of-states-determination-under-the-frank-r-wolf-international-religious-freedom-act-of-2016">administration declined the opportunity</a> to sanction the nonstate actors added to its EPC list announced in March 2018. Further, it ignored Congress' invitation under IRFA to use the president's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905-2.pdf">National Security Strategy</a> to articulate that promotion of the right to freedom of religion is a strategy that “protects other, related human rights, and advances democracy outside the United States.” Likewise, the president's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf">budget for 2019 allocates no funds</a> to the promotion of international religious freedom activities.

The administration also has taken no executive action to elevate the status of international religious freedom within the State Department’s bureaucracy. Thus, the Ambassador at Large and Office of International Religious are still buried within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) under the oversight of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/j/">Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights</a>. Nor has President Trump appointed NSC staff dedicated to international religious freedom or created committees intended to incorporate religious freedom into policy decision-making, as suggested by Congress. Finally, the president has left IRFA’s new “Special Watch List” to idle. By electing to add only Pakistan to the list, the administration effectively shrugged off Congress’ intention that the list serve as a mechanism for earlier and more purposeful engagement with countries violating religious freedom but falling short of the CPC standard. In contrast, USCIRF recently added 12 countries to its own Tier 2 list, which identifies those countries tolerating or engaging in serious religious freedom violations characterized by at least one element of the higher CPC standard.

Faced with this track record of indifference, human rights advocates and victims of violations of freedom of religion should not mistake an international gathering as a serious commitment to promoting freedom of religion or belief. If this administration was sincere about "<a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/05/282789.htm">push[ing] back against persecution and ensur[ing] greater respect for religious freedom for all</a>," it could easily substantiate this commitment by implementing its existing IRFA obligations. The absence of such action confirms that religious freedom is unlikely to be an outlier in the president’s policy of scorn for human rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>C</strong>alifornia was the 5th state to explicitly permit mentally competent terminally ill patients to obtain a prescription from their physician for medication the patient may ingest to achieve a peaceful death, a medical practice known as aid in dying. This option appeals to some patients who find themselves trapped in a protracted dying process, where the cumulative burden of suffering causes them to prefer a swift death instead of enduring yet more suffering before death arrives. California’s law was passed in 2015, during a special session of the legislature focused on health care. Called the<span> </span><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520162AB15">“End of Life Option Act”</a><span> </span>(EOLA), the law became effective on June 9, 2016 and has been implemented since then pursuant to rigorous requirements: patients must have no more than 6 months life expectancy; they must be fully mentally competent; they must be able to self administer the medication; they must make multiple requests, oral and written, separated by a mandatory waiting period, which must be witnessed. Physicians must report all AID prescriptions to the State, which publishes data about the practice annually.

Opponents of aid in dying<span> </span><a href="http://public-access.riverside.courts.ca.gov/OpenAccess/Civil/CivilCaseReport.asp?CourtCode=A&amp;RivInd=RIV&amp;CaseType=RIC&amp;CaseNumber=1607135">challenged</a><span> </span>the statute on various grounds, including alleging that it was invalid as beyond the scope of the special session in which it was enacted.

On May 21, 2018, the Superior Court held the EOLA was invalid on the ground that it was not sufficiently related to the subject matter of the special legislative session in which it was enacted, called by the Governor to address health care related issues. Some commentators have observed that the scope of the legislature’s power to act in special session is to be given great deference, that there is a strong presumption in favor of laws adopted during special sessions, and that “courts are and should of right be reluctant to hold that such action is not embraced in such call, and will not so declare unless the subject manifestly and clearly is not embraced therein” citing the leading California Supreme Court decision on the subject,<span> </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17464964412588322036&amp;q=Martin+v.+Riley&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39"><span class="casename">Martin v. Riley</span></a><span> </span>(1942).

The finding that the statutory permission for aid in dying is not related to ‘health care’ is erroneous. Indeed, the Supreme Court of the United States has<span> </span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17055043890936848595&amp;q=Gonzales+v.+Oregon&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">recognized</a><span> </span>that prescribing medication for aid in dying is a medical practice. In a case prompted by then US Attorney General Ashcroft’s issuance of a Directive that physicians prescribing medication for aid in dying would be in violation of the federal<span> </span><a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/index.html">Controlled Substances Act</a>, the Court held that prescribing medication for aid in dying constitutes a “legitimate medical practice” for purposes of federal controlled substances law. In that case, the State of Oregon and a group of terminally ill Oregonians challenged the authority of the Attorney General to nullify a validly enacted state statute permitting aid in dying by applying the Controlled Substances Act well beyond its intended scope of deterring illicit drug trafficking. In considering the matter, the Court addressed whether a physician prescribing medication for the purpose of aid in dying was acting with a “legitimate medical purpose." The Court concluded that he or she would be doing so, hence the federal Controlled Substances Act could not be applied to punish any physician for such conduct. This precedent offers an additional argument in support of prompt reversal of the ruling by the Riverside Superior court that the EOLA is invalid on the grounds that it does not relate to health care and medical treatment.

The California Attorney General has properly defended the EOLA, and following the May 21 ruling immediately filed a petition for appeal and other relief in the Forth District. In its brief the AG correctly urges that deference is owed the legislature and the EOLA pertains to health care. It argues that California Supreme Court jurisprudence compels such deference. The AG can bolster its argument by bringing to the appellate courts’ attention the United States Supreme Court precedent pertinent to this case.

California’s aid in dying law should be quickly reinstated. Patients dying difficult deaths should have this compassionate option, which a great majority of the public supports and which was made available to them by enactment of the EOLA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In some personal injury cases, juries award considerable sums for compensation. This often occurs when the plaintiff suffers serious and painful injuries, and the jury decides to award a significant amount of non-economic injuries. If the defendant’s actions are deemed egregious or malicious, the jury may also award a large amount of punitive damages. Yet the juries’ monetary decisions do not always stand. Juries cannot always give any amount of compensation they want. Depending on the state, jury awards may be restricted by statutory caps and court intervention.

Some states have statutory personal injury recovery limits, known as “caps.” These caps dictate the maximum amount of compensation the jury may award. Caps may pertain to all compensatory damages or limit only non-economic damages. Or, caps may be directed toward certain types of claims, typically medical malpractice or product liability, and not general personal injury cases.

Many jurisdictions limit punitive damages either by a statutory cap or based on guidance by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span><em><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/538/408.html">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell</a> (2003).</em></span><span> In California and New York, in <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3284199949966744917&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Torres v. B/E Aerospace, Inc. (2018),</a></em> </span><span>and <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2018/2018_00278.htm">Gomez v. Cabatic</a> (2018)</span><span>, respectively, plaintiff’s punitive damages were significantly decreased from the amount originally awarded by the juries by the judges. </span>

Both statutory caps and punitive damage limits may significantly decrease the compensation a plaintiff receives from a jury. However, statutory caps are continuously being challenged on the grounds that they are unconstitutional. Oregon’s cap most recently faced such a challenge, and it was deemed unconstitutional in <span><em><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/court-of-appeals/2017/a154774.html">Vasquez v. Double Press Mfg., Inc.</a></em></span> (2017) and <span><em><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/or-court-of-appeals/1884971.html">Rains v. Stayton Builders Mart, Inc.</a></em>(2018). </span>

<strong>Where Are Compensatory Damages Capped?</strong>

Not all plaintiffs encounter statutory caps. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia do not have statutory caps for general tort and personal injury cases: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

Ten states have statutory caps for non-economic damages in general tort and personal injury cases: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee.

This ensures plaintiffs may pursue compensation for all of their economic losses, such as medical expenses and lost wages. However, plaintiffs cannot receive more than the cap for their non-economic injuries, including pain and suffering.

Twenty-four states cap plaintiff’s non-economic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits, six cap total compensation in medical malpractice cases, and ten cap non-economic damages in product liability claims.

<strong>When Are Punitive Damages Limited?</strong>

Another way in which plaintiff’s total compensation in a personal injury suit may be limited is in regard to punitive damages, which are intended to punish and deter the wrongdoer. In most jurisdictions, punitive damages are not available in cases involving ordinary negligence. Instead, plaintiffs must be injured in an accident caused by another person’s gross negligence or intentional misconduct to seek punitive damages.

Punitive damages are capped in 27 states, either by a particular amount or a punitive-to-compensatory damages ratio. Punitive damages are not inherently based on a plaintiff’s economic and non-economic damages. However, one of the most common means of calculating punitive damages is by using a multiplier of compensatory damages, which can be calculated using a ratio, such as 3:1. This would mean the punitive damages are three times the plaintiff’s compensatory damages.

Another way in which punitive damages may be capped is through judicial intervention. In 2018, California and New York appellate courts reduced punitive damages to a 1:1 or lower ratio based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in <span><em>State Farm</em></span>.

The U.S. Supreme Court stated “…in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process.” The court went on to say, “an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.” Additionally, “When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.”

In <span><em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3284199949966744917&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Torres,</a></em></span> the plaintiff was awarded $75,000 in economic damages, $1.44 million in non-economic damages, and $7 million in punitive damages. The California trial court upheld the compensatory damages; However, it ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff accepted a remittitur to $1 million in punitive damages. Both the plaintiff and defendant appealed, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed the decision in May 2018. The court relied on reasoning by the California Supreme Court, which has stated punitive damages should rarely go beyond a single-digit multiplier, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance.

A similar decision occurred in the New York Appellate Division in January 2018. In <span>Gomez</span>, the jury awarded the plaintiff $500,000 in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages. The trial court ordered a remittitur of the punitive damages to $1.2 million. The appellate court reduced the punitive damages even further to $500,000, a 1:1 ratio, citing the Supreme Court’s <em>State Farm</em> decision.

While the U.S. Supreme Court specifically did not want to provide a rigid mathematical formula for punitive damages, it did create a precedent for setting punitive damages between a 1:1 and 4:1 ratio.

These recent decisions demonstrate that courts are taking the Court’s guidance seriously. Plaintiffs involved in a case in which the defendant’s actions were reckless, egregious, or malicious should be aware that they can seek considerable punitive damages, however they may be limited or reduced by the court.

<strong>Statutory Caps Face Legal Challenges</strong>

Compensation caps are unconstitutional in some states. Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming have constitutional provisions prohibiting caps for general tort claims. In other states, caps have been challenged in court, which has led courts in Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Washington, and Oregon to find that damage caps are unconstitutional. In Alabama, Georgia, and North Dakota medical malpractice compensation caps have also been found unconstitutional.

Oregon is one of the most recent states to face challenges over its damage cap. Oregon had a statutory provision limiting non-economic damages. Oregon’s <a href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/31.710">statute</a> provides for a $500,000 limit on non-economic damages for most tort claims.

In February 2018, the Oregon Court of Appeals in <span><em><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/court-of-appeals/2017/a154774.html">Vasquez</a></em></span> and <span><em>Rains</em></span> ruled caps on non-economic damages are unconstitutional.

In <em>Vasquez</em>, the plaintiff was crushed and severely injured by a machine the plaintiff’s employer had purchased from the defendant. Following a trial, the plaintiff received a judgement of $1,339,090.20 in economic damages and $4,860,000 in noneconomic damages, and the trial court did not reduce the verdict.

In <em>Rains</em>, the plaintiff fell a significant distance when a defective board broke while he was working. He sued a number of parties, including the board’s manufacturer, and his wife sued for loss of consortium. Following a trial, the plaintiff received a judgment of $3,928,275 in economic damages and $2,343,750 in noneconomic damages. His wife received $739,375 in noneconomic damages. The trial court did not reduce any of the amounts.

In both cases, the defendant’s appealed the jury awards arguing the non-economic damages should be capped under Oregon law. The plaintiffs responded that the non-economic damages cap violates the remedy clause within the <span><a href="https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/Pages/OrConst.aspx">Oregon Constitution</a></span>. Article I, Section 10 states “No court shall be secret, but justice shall be administered, openly and without purchase, completely and without delay, and every man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.”

The court found both times that reducing the amount based on the cap would leave the plaintiffs with a “paltry fraction” of the amount granted them, which amounted to a constitutionally unacceptable remedy.

Oregon and seven other states are proof that there may be a basis for challenging a compensation cap that impacts a plaintiff’s lawsuit and recovery. If a damage cap is applied to a judgment in a personal injury case, or the defendant appeals the amount of a verdict, plaintiffs should speak with their attorneys about challenging the statutory cap.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>S</strong>ince the 1960s, most plaintiffs challenging state restrictions on voting rights have relied primarily on the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection Clause of the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment</a>. The 1966 case of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/663/"><em>Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections</em></a> in particular played a key role in the rise of equal protection claims by aggrieved voters. In <em>Harper</em> the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Virginia’s $1.50 poll tax on grounds it violated the equal protection clause. Writing for the majority, Justice Douglas declared that “the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment restrains the States from fixing voter qualifications which invidiously discriminate.”

For the past half century equal protection has been the centerpiece of voting rights litigation. Equal protection analysis lay at the heart of cases as diverse as the presidential election controversy in <em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/#tab-opinion-1960861">Bush v. Gore</a></em> and the Voter ID dispute in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-21.ZS.html"><em>Crawford v. Marion County Election Board</em></a>.

But after all these years, could it turn out that the due process clause is a better vehicle for voting rights? For at least some cases, there is reason to believe the answer may be yes.

<strong>Foley on Due Process Clause </strong>

In a groundbreaking recent article in the <em>University of Chicago Law Review</em>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2815892">“Due Process, Fair Play, and Excessive Partisanship: A New Principle for Judicial Review of Election Laws,”</a> Edward Foley proposes using the due process clause to defend voting rights. As Professor Foley points out, the concept of equal protection is often not a useful tool for challenging certain types of voting restrictions, such as reductions in early voting periods which apply to all voters equally.

In a number of cases, however, the Due Process Clause offers an alternative grounds on which to challenge such laws. In the famous case of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/310/"><em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</em></a>, the Supreme Court held that the due process clause requires courts exercising jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants to comply with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Applying that concept to the election law context, Professor Foley argues that the principle of “fair play is an appropriate concept to employ as a constraint on excessive partisanship.”

To that end, the due process clause could be employed to challenge both partisan gerrymanders and politically-motivated restrictions on voting rights. For example, in the context of voting rules, Foley argues that “[i]f voters have reasonably come to rely on the availability of a particular type of voting procedure, and if the government removes its availability without a legitimately nonpartisan reason for doing so, then this removal is a form of inappropriate partisanship in violation of fair play and due process.”

A recent case in New Hampshire suggests that courts may indeed look favorably upon due process arguments brought by aggrieved voters.

<strong>The New Hampshire Case</strong>

On August 14, a New Hampshire federal court struck down on due process grounds a state voting requirement that barred 275 absentee ballots from being counted during the 2016 election. The case of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/saucedo-v-gardner-order"><em>Saucedo v. Gardner</em></a> arose from a New Hampshire state law requiring signatures on absentee ballots to match the signatures on absentee ballot applications. A group of absentee voters brought suit alleging the signature-match requirement violated their due process rights.

The <em>Saucedo</em> case turned on the arbitrary nature of the signature-match requirement and the state’s failure to provide adequate notice to voters whose absentee ballots were rejected. In ruling for the plaintiffs, the district court noted that election administrators received “no training in handwriting analysis or signature comparison” and state law provided no “functional standards to distinguish the natural variations of one writer from other variations that suggest two different writers.” The court further noted that “the voter is not even given notice that her ballot has been rejected due to a signature mismatch” and the voter has no opportunity for “review or appeal.”

The court concluded, therefore, that “in light of the fundamental importance of the right to vote, the current process for rejecting voters due to a signature mismatch fails to guarantee basic fairness.” As the court explained, the law gave rise to an unacceptably high “risk that qualified voters are wrongly disenfranchised” and minor refinements would be insufficient in remedying the flaws in the signature-match process. The court thus granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs’ on their procedural due process claim.

<strong>The Husted Case</strong>

The New Hampshire case makes for an interesting contrast with the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent ruling in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/584/16-980/#tab-opinion-3913484"><em>Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute</em></a>. In <em>Husted</em>, a 5-4 majority upheld an Ohio law that purges voters from registration rolls for failing to vote in three consecutive federal elections.

<em>Husted</em> turned on the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/2">National Voter Registration Act</a>’s “Failure to Vote” clause, which requires states to notify inactive voters before purging them from registration lists. The NVRA requires the states to send to inactive voters “a postage prepaid and pre-addressed return card” asking them to confirm their address. Under the Ohio law, a voter’s failure to respond to the return card, combined with six years of voting inactivity, results in the cancellation of the voter’s registration. The Supreme Court held that Ohio’s procedure complied with the NVRA’s bare minimum requirements. As Justice Alito explained in the majority opinion, “this case presents a question of statutory interpretation, not a question of policy.”

But had the plaintiffs brought a 14th Amendment due process challenge, rather than base their arguments solely on a matter of statutory interpretation, they might have encountered more success with the Court.

The statutory argument failed to persuade a majority of the Court because the NVRA only establishes a bare minimum notice requirement. But the Constitutional standard for due process is arguably much higher. After all, common sense would suggest that a voter might inadvertently overlook a single postcard notice from the secretary of state’s office. In the Ohio case, therefore, a good argument could be made that Constitutional due process requires the state to send multiple mailings to inactive voters, not just a single return card. It would also seem reasonable to require the secretary of state’s office to consult other government databases before concluding that a voter had moved out of the voting jurisdiction.

As the Supreme Court explained in the famous case of <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/339/306/"><em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co</em>.</a>, “when notice is a person’s due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process. The means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.”

But <em>Husted</em> turned solely on the notice requirements of the NVRA, not the notice requirements of the Constitution’s due process clause, and the challengers went down to defeat.

<strong>The Future of Voting Rights</strong>

It remains to be seen how the U.S. Supreme Court would respond to due process arguments in a voting rights context. But the plaintiffs’ success in the <em>Saucedo</em> case suggests that we could be in the early stages of a new era in election law jurisprudence. As Professor Foley argues, “Interpreting due process to condemn partisan overreaching is a construction of the Constitution that accords with the best understanding of its history and its role in safeguarding the democracy that it both established and perpetuates.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When considering the comments in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with the perspective of thirteen years since their landfall, I’ll paraphrase Mark Twain’s comment about an erroneously pre-<span>mature 1897 obituary: “the </span><span>reports of [disastrous performance and] death are greatly [but </span><span>not entirely] exaggerated.” The </span><span>perspective of time and the </span><span>restoration of many services to </span><span>the Hurricane Katrina and Rita-stricken Gulf Coast reveal that </span><span>matters of government ineptitude </span><span>and dreadful disaster relief efforts </span><span>were not quite as they seemed closer to the event, and that even reputable news sources were prone to advancing hyperbolic accounts if not “fake news.”</span>

On September 29, 2005, the front page of the New York Times announced with calm perspective that “fear exceeded crime’s reality” in New Orleans. The <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/us/nationalspecial/fear-exceeded-crimes-reality-in-new-orleans.html">reportage</a> </span>from Jim Dwyer and Christopher Drew described how “some, though not all, of the most alarming stories that coursed through the city [of New Orleans] <span>appear to be little more than figments of frightened imaginations, the product of chaotic circumstances that included no reliable communications, and per</span><span>haps the residue of the long-</span><span>standing raw relations between </span><span>some police officers and members of the public.” New </span><span>Orleans’ then Police </span><span>Superintendent, Edwin P. </span><span>Compass III, reported on </span><span>September 1, 2005, </span><span>amongst </span><span>other things, of “tourists being </span><span>preyed upon” that now seems </span><span>exaggerated as the police department has “no official reports of</span><span>rapes and murders” and “not one </span><span>official report of rape or sexual </span><span>assault.” For that matter, it seems </span><span>of the 885 dead, only about six </span><span>or seven deaths appear to be </span><span>homicides. However unaccept</span><span>able that toll may have been, it is well </span><span>within the 5.09 murders per week </span><span>which New Orleans might have “normally” expected, since its <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8999837/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/new-orleans-murder-rate-rise-again/">murder rate</a> was an incredible 10 times that </span><span>of the national average (265 in </span><span>2004, which still is lower than </span><span>421 in 1994). New Orleans can </span><span>scarcely boast of a robust police </span><span>department, especially when several hundred of its force walked off the job during a crisis. In the </span><span>best of times there <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8999837/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/new-orleans-murder-rate-rise-again/">were</a> only 3.14 </span><span>officers per 1,000 citizens - less </span><span>than half of that of Washington,</span><span>D.C. </span>

What successes and failures might we now see more clearly, and outline ever-so-briefly - with hind sight corrected to 20/20 - <span>about how local, state, and federal government performed during </span><span>Hurricane Katrina? Strike up the </span><span>strident Sergio Leone – <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/good-bad-ugly-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-remastered/486088021">Ennio Morricone soundtrack</a> of my </span><span>favorite 1966 “spaghetti western” </span><span>movie, but join it with Jazz-Cajun-Zydeco undertones, as we </span><span>retell a Gumbo Gulf Coastal tale </span><span>of fear, fate, disorder, and dynamic heroism, with chronology categories of “the Good, the Bad </span><span>and the Ugly.” (With reliance</span><span> </span><span>on <a href="http://online.fliphtml5.com/cgtr/yuwq/">chronological materials</a> from </span><span>the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/20051012_NewOrleans.pdf">Brookings Institute</a>):</span>

<strong>THE GOOD:<span>  </span></strong>On Friday, August 26, at 9:00 am, the White House declared that an impending disaster was about to take place in the Gulf Coast, ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and<span>  </span>the<span> </span>Department<span> </span>of Homeland<span> </span>Security<span> </span>into<span> </span>action.<span> </span>The <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2013/05/kevin-govern-posse-comitatus/">lawful military support to civil authorities</a> </span>would be in accordance with over a century of federal troop deployments and 200-plus years of legal precedent.

<strong> </strong><strong>THE BAD AND THE UGLY:<span>  </span></strong>Unfortunately, it takes 14 hours for Governor Blanco of Louisiana to declare a state ofemergency, setting the stage for an ugly set of events to follow.

<strong>THE GOOD:<span>  </span></strong>On Saturday, August 27, the National Hurricane Center director calls Mayor C. Ray Nagin to advise him to conduct a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans.

<strong>THE BAD: </strong>Mayor Nagin waits until 5:00 p.m. that day to direct a “voluntary” evacuation of his city, with residents in low-lying areas encouraged, but not man<span>dated, to leave.</span>

<strong>THE UGLY</strong>: This failure to direct a mandatory evacuation will set the stage for aggravated conditions and hardship, despite prior warning and DHS Secretary Chertoff’s advice that levees will break in New Orleans. Mayor Nagin still does not order mandatory evacuation of New Orleans until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, August 28.

<strong>THE GOOD: </strong><span> </span>Rising early to cope with <span>the impending </span><span>disaster, at 9:30 a.m. Mayor Nagin orders </span><span>that the Regional </span><span>Transit Authority buses pick up </span><span>people to transport them to </span><span>places of refuge.</span>

<strong>THE BAD AND THE UGLY:<span>  </span></strong>Throughout the day of August 28, people fleeing low-lying areas are seeking places elsewhere IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS <span>including the convention center and the Superdome. The latter site fills with 10,000 people ill-prepared to weather out the </span><span>storm or sustain their own individual needs. The convention </span><span>center was never on the <a href="https://www.nola.gov/homeland-security/">New Orleans Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan</a>, </span><span>hence its becoming ill-suited to </span><span>its desperate “visitors.” Likewise, </span><span>the famous domed Superdome </span><span>sports venue becomes infamous </span><span>with scenes of refugee-camp </span><span>squalor, guarded by only 150 </span><span>National Guardsmen. Mayor Nagin finally sees the need for a </span><span>mandatory evacuation and orders </span><span>the same at 11:00 a.m. However by </span><span>noon, highways out of New </span><span>Orleans are blocked. FEMA sends </span><span>water, food and supplies (</span><span>unfortunately not far enough) </span><span>to Texas and Georgia, but not to</span><span>Alabama, Mississippi or other closer distribution locations.</span>

<strong>THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY:<span>  </span></strong>By 11:00 in the morning on Monday, August 29, the FEMA director orders 1,000 employees to the afflicted area. This is, how<span>ever, five (5) hours after Hurricane Katrina’s landfall, and </span><span>those 1,000 FEMA workers are </span><span>given an entire two (2) days to </span><span>arrive on scene. Furthermore (incredibly), the New Orleans’ </span><span>fire and police “first responders” are told </span><span>to only come to the city if </span><span>there was “proper coordination </span><span>between the state and local officials.” This begs the question of </span><span>who would know whether there </span><span>was proper coordination and how </span><span>they would know that, and why </span><span>FEMA would interfere in local </span><span>disaster relief in the first place.</span>

<strong>THE GOOD:</strong><span>  </span>Throughout the <span>day on August 29, Louisiana’s citizen-soldier National Guardsmen and </span><span>America’s Coast Guard, </span><span>exemplifying their motto “Always</span><span>Ready” (Semper Paratus), rescued 1,200 stranded citizens.</span>

<strong>THE BAD AND THE UGLY:</strong><span>  </span><span>Not until Tuesday, August 30, </span><span>does FEMA activate its then-eight-month-old (December 2004) </span><span>National Response Plan (<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/NRP_Brochure.pdf">NRP</a>)</span><span>; </span><span>incredibly, FEMA stops </span><span>volunteer fire fighters from coming to the city and asks them to </span><span>wait for the National Guard </span><span>instead. The Superdome still is </span><span>overwhelmed with people, and </span><span>there is no plan to evacuate </span><span>it until that morning when </span><span>Governor Blanco orders the </span><span>Superdome’s evacuation, but fails </span><span>to set a timetable or provide for adequate assets to do so. Reports </span><span>of widespread looting, however factual or exaggerated, led the </span><span>police to focus on crime-fighting </span><span>rather than search-and-rescue.</span>

<strong>THE GOOD: </strong>On August 30, <span>FEMA boosts disaster support </span><span>later in the day </span><span>with 29 medical teams and 1,700 </span><span>trailers, trucks, and military</span><span> </span><span>assets to evacuate the seriously </span><span>wounded and ill. Military su</span>p<span>port increases to 30,000 troops.</span>

<strong>THE BAD AND THE UGLY:</strong><span>  </span><span>On Thursday, September 1, FEMA </span><span>suspends water rescue, and the </span><span>Superdome still is overcrowded </span><span>with 45,000 displaced citizens. In </span><span>surrealistic simulcasts of scenes </span><span>within the Superdome and emergency leaders out of touch with </span><span>ongoing events, both DHS </span><span>Secretary Chertoff and FEMA </span><span>director Brown are interviewed </span><span>on national television stating</span><span> </span><span>that they were unaware of the situation at the Superdome and </span><span>convention center until a few </span><span>hours before. Violence (purportedly) escalates throughout New </span><span>Orleans.</span>

<strong>THE GOOD:</strong><span>  </span><span>On Thursday, </span><span>September 2, Congress approves </span><span>$10.5 Billion for immediate rescue and relief efforts. Within 24 </span><span>hours, President Bush will order another 7,200 active forces to </span><span>the Gulf Coast and an additional </span><span>40,000 National Guardsmen.</span>

<strong>THE BAD AND THE UGLY:</strong><span>  </span><span>Despite the increase in Federal </span><span>and Louisiana State presence by </span><span>September 5 with another 4,700 troops deployed, reports are that </span><span>200 New Orleans police officers </span><span>had “walked off the job,” and 2 </span><span>committed suicide days prior in </span><span>the midst of the crisis around </span><span>them. There are still “stragglers”</span><span>in the Superdome the following </span><span>day. Despite having declared a </span><span>state of emergency on August 26, </span><span>Governor Blanco declares on the </span><span>4th of September a state of “public </span><span>emergency,” and Mayor Nagin’s </span><span>dire September 6, 2005 <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=watching+hooligans+killing+people%2C+raping+people&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab">claimed observations</a> of “watching hooligans </span><span>killing people, raping people” is </span><span>countered with a “police emergency” declaration resulting in doubts </span><span>in the minds of those who must </span><span>enforce it as to whether the use of force will be authorized.</span>

<strong>EPILOGUE TO THE BAD AND THE UGLY:</strong><span> </span><span>To be sure, many lessons were learned and re-learned from what went well </span><span>and what went wrong in the </span><span>planning, preparation, and execution of emergency services and </span><span>disaster assistance. This extended to a myriad of other disasters including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2018/7/24/17579654/hurricane-superstorm-nyc-flood-recovery-climate-change-technology-sandy">Superstorm Sandy</a>. Through collaborative efforts of FEMA and the </span><span><a href="https://www.gohsep.la.gov/RECOVER/KATRINA-RITA-10-YEARS-LATER">Louisiana Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness</a> </span>(GOHSEP), more than $19.6 billion in direct and indirect assistance has come over the past thirteen years, providing <span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2015/08/24/louisiana-recovery-update-katrina-and-rita-numbers">temporary housing</a> </span>to nearly <strong>85,000 families </strong>displaced by Katrina and Rita, with FEMA <span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2015/08/24/louisiana-recovery-update-katrina-and-rita-numbers">claiming</a> </span>as of three years ago, all of these survivors had returned to longer-term housing. At the same time, many agencies, including the military, <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/us/storm-and-crisis-the-inquiry-at-hearings-states-and-national-guard-make.html">sought the opportunity</a> </span>and resources <span>to “get well” and become “fully </span><span>equipped and ready to deploy </span><span>instantly in a crisis.” </span>

As tempting as it may be to suggest scrapping existing state-federal planning and disaster relief execution in favor of a privatized solution, I would suggest that capable corporations and caring charities that aren’t habitually “in the business” of disaster relief can only provide spirited but sporadic, heartfelt but ad hoc, relief efforts. What contract-charity-corporation conglomerate could cover 90,000 square miles of affected area and mobilize the entire Federal, state, and local government to support rescue and recovery as FEMA did (or attempted to do)? Could that conglomeration deploy 72,000 personnel to rescue 33,000 people, directly aid 90,000+ people, or provide billions in disaster assistance to over 600,000 households?

Enlightened leadership at the local, state and federal levels, employing prescient planning, and enhanced organizations, will be able to effectively cope with the next “major disaster” and beyond.

		<title>“Martyrdom” and International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Very</strong> conspicuously, Israel’s Palestinian foes regard “martyrdom” as among the highest expressions of religious sacredness. Nonetheless, there are distinctly prominent disjunctions between the pertinent obligations of faith and those of international law. In essence, only the latter set of obligations can have a properly authoritative place in assessing Palestinian resorts to international force.

This is the case, moreover, even when the stated objective of any such resorts would be “self-determination” or “national liberation.”

<em>Ex injuria jus non oritur</em>. In law, <em>all law</em>, rights can never derive from wrongs. Significantly, this principle is "peremptory," or fundamental. It follows that those Palestinian insurgents who would seek to justify their willful maiming and execution of noncombatants in the name of any so-called “martyrdom” are defiling the law. Identifying insurgent fighters as "martyrs" can have no jurisprudential impact upon this judgment. Nomenclature can do nothing to absolve such perpetrators from the codified and customary crimes of terrorism.

There is more. Even if the indignant Palestinian calls for "national self-determination" were correctly grounded in law, "martyrs" would remain tainted by serious expressions of wrongdoing. Under settled international law, all insurgents, even those with a more-or-less supportable "just cause," must satisfy firm jurisprudential limits concerning permissible targets and permissible levels of violence or armed force.

Following <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2012/11/427052-general-assembly-grants-palestine-non-member-observer-state-status-un">an earlier vote by the UN General Assembly</a>, “Palestine” is now justified to call itself a “nonmember observer state.” Although such a designation essentially by-passes the usually more critical expectations of legal rules regarding statehood, especially the <a href="https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/01/1-02/rights-duties-states.xml"><em>Convention on the Rights and Duties of States</em></a> (1934), much of the world is seemingly prepared to ultimately accept the reality of full Palestinian sovereignty. Most recently, it seems that US President Donald Trump has offered Palestinians some sort of three-party confederation with Jordan and Israel.

Still, absolutely any illegal expressions of insurgent force by “Palestine” would necessarily qualify as terrorism.

It’s not bewildering. Even the most "sacred" rights of insurgency under international law exclude the intentional targeting of civilians and/or the use of force to inflict gratuitous pain and suffering. It is always terrorism, <em>prima facie</em>, when Palestinian insurgents murder Israeli families in their homes or automobiles by stabbing and shooting their victims. Incontestably, it is also terrorism whenever these "martyrs" place their nail-filled bombs in exposed public places.

As to the legal argument known formally as <em>tu quoque </em>– that is, that because the other side is allegedly guilty of similar or equivalent criminality, “our” side is free of any legal wrongdoing – such an argument is always invalid. In other words, at least since the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/nuremberg-trials#section_2">Nuremberg Trial judgments of 1945-46</a>, it is never exculpatory.

It all comes down to this. Even under the most generous definitions discoverable in relevant law, the residual legal right to armed force can never supplant the peremptory rules of humanitarian international law. Among international lawyers, such <em>jus cogens</em> rules are also known as the <em>law of armed conflict </em>or the<em> law of war.</em>

Unceasingly, and without a scintilla of either evidence or nuance, supporters of Palestinian terror-violence against Israeli noncombatants insist that the ends (Palestinian independence) justify the means (multiple deliberate attacks upon defenseless civilian populations). Leaving aside any ordinary ethical standards by which such argumentation must unhesitatingly be judged indecent, the ends can never justify the means under binding international law. Plainly, for more than two thousand years, unassailable and unhidden legal principles have clarified that intentional violence against the innocent is <em>always</em> prohibited.

From the standpoint of authoritative international law, one man's (or woman's) terrorist, can never be another man's (or woman's) "freedom-fighter." Although sometimes fashionable to bring up at cocktail parties or political gatherings, this all-too-common expression is merely a glaringly empty witticism. It is true, of course, that certain insurgencies can sometimes be judged lawful or even law-enforcing (that judgment is, after all, a founding principle of the United States), but even such presumptively allowable resorts to force must still conform to the indispensable laws of war.

Whenever an insurgent group resorts to manifestly unjust means, its actions constitute terrorism. Even if ritualistic Palestinian claims of a gratuitously hostile "occupation" were accepted as reasonable and plausible, corollary claims of entitlement to "any means necessary" would still remain false.

It’s not complicated. International law has a precise and determinable form and content. It cannot be casually invented and reinvented by terror groups or “nonmember observer states” in order to wrongly justify selective interests. This is especially the case where terror violence intentionally targets a designated victim state’s most fragile and vulnerable civilian populations.

National liberation movements that fail to meet the test of <em>just means</em> are never correctly protected as lawful or legitimate. Even if law were somehow to accept the argument that PA, Hamas and certain assorted sister groups had satisfied the authoritative criteria of "national liberation," they could still not satisfy the equally relevant legal standards of <em>discrimination</em>, <em>proportionality</em>, and <em>military necessity</em>. More precisely, these critical standards were applied to insurgent or sub-state organizations by the common <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/375-590006">Article 3 of the four <em>Geneva Conventions</em> of 1949</a>, and (additionally) by the two <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/additional-protocols-1977.htm">1977 <em>Protocols </em></a>to these <em>Conventions</em>.

These standards of "humanity" are also binding upon all combatants by virtue of certain broader customary and conventional international law, including <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Article.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=BD48EA8AD56596A3C12563CD0051653F">Article 1 of the <em>Preamble</em> to the <em>Fourth Hague Convention</em> of 1907</a>. This rule, commonly called the "<em>Martens Clause</em>," makes <em>all persons</em> responsible for the "laws of humanity" and for the associated "dictates of public conscience."

Under relevant international law, even at the hands of a “nonmember observer state,” the ends can never justify the means. As in the case of war between states, every use of force by insurgents must always be judged twice, once with regard to the justness of the objective (in this case, a Palestinian state to be built upon the explicitly planned-for ruins of a pre-existing Jewish state), and once with regard to the justness of the means used to achieve this objective.

For the most part, American and European supporters of authentic Palestinian statehood continue to presume that this entity would become a willing part of some "two-state solution." Nonetheless, this too-generous presumption is expressly dismissed in the Arab/Islamic world. Cartographically, the "Map of Palestine" at the official website of the Palestinian National Authority and also Hamas (The Islamic Resistance Movement) still includes <em>all of Israel</em>.

Only one state is depicted on this revealing map. That state is “Palestine.” Here there is no Israel.

Under binding world law, terrorist crimes mandate universal cooperation in both apprehension and punishment. <em>Inter alia,</em> as punishers of "grave breaches" under international law, all states are expected to search out and prosecute or extradite, individual terrorists. In no conceivable circumstances are states permitted to regard terrorists as "freedom fighters."

This is emphatically true for the United States, which incorporates all international law as the "supreme law of the land" at <a href="https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A6.html">Article 6 of the <em>Constitution</em></a>, and which was formed by the Founding Fathers according to timeless principles of Natural Law. Accordingly, although generally unrecognized, core legal authority for the new eighteenth-century republic was derived from Blackstone’s supremely famous and constitutive <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/blackstone.asp"><em>Commentaries</em></a>.

In law, <em>all law</em>, rights can never stem from wrongs. Even if Israel’s Palestinian adversaries continue to insist on treating their most recalcitrant insurgents as "martyrs," such treatment could have no exculpatory or mitigating effect on attendant terrorist crimes. Irrespective of the justness of cause - and this includes any alleged right to full sovereignty for "Palestine" - nothing under international law can ever justify the deliberate targeting of non-combatant populations.

Summing up, there is no special place under international law for countenancing “martyrs."

<em>None.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time ever, on September 12, the European Parliament (EP) launched Article 7 TEU (<a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-1-common-provisions/7-article-7.html">Lisbon Treaty</a>) proceedings against Hungary’s government. The Parliament began the action by adopting a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A8-2018-0250&amp;language=EN">report</a> by Judith Sargentini, a member from the Netherlands. The report lists 12 major concerns from the functioning of the constitutional and the electoral system to economic and social rights. These concerns violate the values pronounced in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-1-common-provisions/2-article-2.html">Article 2</a> of the Lisbon Treaty. A country that violates these values certainly cannot be considered a liberal democracy. Nor can it be an ‘<a href="https://budapestbeacon.com/full-text-of-viktor-orbans-speech-at-baile-tusnad-tusnadfurdo-of-26-july-2014/">illiberal democracy</a>’ or a ‘<a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/prime-minister-viktor-orban-s-speech-at-the-29th-balvanyos-summer-open-university-and-student-camp">Christian democracy</a>’ as Viktor Orbán, the Prime Minister (PM) of Hungary, likes to characterize his regime. Rather, it is an authoritarian regime, even if it has not used violence to keep power.

As the Sargentini report proves, the non-compliance with the European values started right after the 2010 parliamentary elections, which Orbán called a “revolution of the ballot boxes.” This new constitutional system was the subject of a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A7-2013-0229&amp;language=EN">report</a> for the European Parliament prepared by its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). The report was named after Rui Tavares, a former Portuguese Member of the European Parliament (MEP), who was the rapporteur of this detailed study of Hungarian constitutional developments since 2010. On July 3, 2013, the report passed with a surprisingly lopsided vote: 370 in favor, 248 against and 82 abstentions. In a Parliament with a slight majority of right-leaning lawmakers, this tally indicated that MEPs did not believe the Hungarian government’s claim that the report was merely a conspiracy of the left.

Despite this early warning, Article 7 was triggered by the European Commission against Poland in December 2017, even though the backsliding there had started in 2016 and hadn’t yet reached the level of Hungary. The main reason for this difference was that Orbán’s governing Fidesz party secured votes for the European People’s Party (EPP), the largest faction at the EP, while the Polish governing party, PiS, belonged to the smaller fraction of the European Conservatives and Reformists.

With the adoption of the Sargentini report, the unequal treatment of the two rogue Member States has changed, mostly due to the fact that 115 out of the 218 MEPs of EPP voted to adopt the report. The change of EPP’s view on Orbán occurred after the unexpected announcement of Manfred Weber, EPP’s leader, showed support for the report. Two weeks before the EP vote on the Orbán government, Weber was <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/merkel-orban-the-shameful-failure-of-conservatives-to-confront-right-wing-authoritarians.html">supported by Chancellor Merkel</a> as Spitzenkandidat for the Presidency of the European Commission in the 2019 EP election. After the vote, Weber even challenged leaders of Member States in the Council to take a stance on Orbán’s domestic policies, a position possible because MEPs <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e353ba68-b993-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5">‘did their job’</a> in triggering Article 7 process.

<span>In Orbán’s speech prior to the vote, he did not give any conciliatory sign. Instead, Orbán <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/address-by-prime-minister-viktor-orban-in-the-debate-on-the-so-called-sargentini-report">aggressively attacked</a> the EU with his nationalistic mantra, making his position even worse in the eyes of many vacillating MEPs. “</span>I know that you have already formed your opinions. I know that the majority of you will vote in favor of the report. I also know that my contribution now will not sway your opinions. Yet still I have come here [to Strasbourg] because you are not about to denounce a government, but a country and a people. You will denounce the Hungary which has been a member of the family of Europe's Christian peoples for a thousand years; the Hungary which has contributed to the history of our great continent of Europe with its work and, when needed, with its blood.”

In the speech Orbán also threatened the current European Parliament with a new composition after the 2019 elections, when anti-migrant populist parties can have the lead and form the European Commission: "We need a new European Commission that is committed to the defense of Europe's borders." This threat is the reason for the majority of EPP that, despite their vote for the Sargentini report, do not want to kick out Orbán’s Fidesz from the party before the 2019 parliamentary elections.

The presence of populist governments from East Central Europe makes it very unlikely that the Council will have the necessary 4/5 of the votes finding a serious breach of the values on which the Union is founded. The corrective arm of Article 7, which can lead to sanctions against the Member State, including the suspension of the voting rights of the representative of that government in the Council, can even be vetoed by any Member State.

Besides the overly high threshold inside the Council required to activate the preventive and then the corrective arm of Article 7, Hungary also threatens to legally challenge an eventual Council decision based on the ‘invalid’ vote of the Parliament, which proposed it.  “Abstentions should have been counted in the vote but were not. Thus, the report failed to get the 2/3 majority necessary to carry,” said the Hungarian Prime Minister’s chief of staff. Hence, the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20180913-hungary-mount-legal-challenge-invalid-eu-vote">government is challenging the result’s validity</a> at the European Court of Justice.

Prior to the vote, the EP service in charge of procedures provided for an argument for disregarding abstentions, which is supported by the summary of parliamentary practice. Of course, this does not mean that the Hungarian government cannot be the first to contest disregarding the abstentions in the Court of Justice. However, this can only occur after the decision of the Council because the suggestion of the Parliament cannot be challenged. And the Council’s procedure isn’t a fast one - nine months after triggering Article 7 against Poland, there has still been no decision.

To sum up the possible impact of the Parliamentary resolution, it came too late, several years after the Orbán government’s actions already represented a "clear risk of a serious breach of the values on which the Union is founded." Moreover, launching Article 7 meant <a href="https://www.ceps.eu/publications/european-parliament-vote-article-7-teu-against-hungarian-government-too-late-too-little">very little</a> because besides the important political function of naming and shaming Hungary as a violator of EU values, the chances to reach the corrective arm of the procedure are extremely low. Hence, one can argue that instead of Article 7, <a href="https://verfassungsblog.de/beyond-the-spectacle-the-european-parliaments-article-7-teu-decision-on-hungary/">alternative means</a> from the toolkits of the EU may be more effective. Infringement actions as alternatives have not worked so far in the case of Hungary, but cutting off EU structural funds for regional development or other forms of assistance as a value conditionality approach has yet to be effectively tried.

The usual argument against these financial sanctions is that they would punish the people of Hungary (or Poland for that matter) instead of their leaders, pushing them further away from the EU and into the arms of their <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2017/12/29/view-eu-must-not-surrender-to-illiberal-forces">illiberal governments</a>. Also, academic critics point out that the proposal, if implemented, could undermine the European citizens’ union <a href="http://www.foederalist.eu/2017/05/kein-geld-regelbrecher-politische-bedingungen-eu-strukturfonds-ungarn-polen.html">by leaving behind citizens</a> who live in member states with an authoritarian national government. But consider that those regions taken hostage by their elected officials will be emboldened to stand up against such governments after the loss of EU funds. Illustrating this is a recent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2018/09/13/exclusive-poll-what-do-hungarians-think-of-the-european-parliament-s-vote-to-trigger-artic">poll</a> conducted directly following the European Parliament’s vote to trigger Article 7. It indicates that the European Union is still important for the Hungarian voters with 56% of the respondents answering “yes” when asked if the European Parliament’s decision on the Sargentini report was fair, and just 24% responding “no.” Some 53% of the respondents said the negative vote was only about the Hungarian government, while more than 12% saw it as being about the whole country, and 16% thought it was about both.

In the case of the backsliding Hungary (and Poland), the traditional mechanism of the infringement procedure has not worked, and the recently triggered Article 7 procedure does not seem to force the government to end the breach of European values. Therefore, cutting off funds can perhaps be more effective to achieve this goal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>P</strong>eople like me, who believe we should have tighter regulation of firearms, like to use the word “reasonable.” We support reasonable gun control measures, steps that would preserve gun rights but keep guns out of the wrong hands and reduce the risk of harm from improper use of firearms.

Those who support reasonable gun control must be willing to acknowledge when restrictions on guns are unreasonable. Given the bitterness of the national debate over guns, it could be easy to slip into the trap of thinking that anything the other side condemns must be worth supporting, so any law challenged by gun rights advocates must be defended. But that is not the case, and a good example can be found in a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/09/federal-judge-rules-against-california-gun-ad-law/">recent decision</a> about California’s law prohibiting gun stores from having signs that mention handguns or contain images of handguns.

The law, found in <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-6/26800-26915/26820">§ 26820</a> of California’s Penal Code, states that “No handgun or imitation handgun, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof, shall be displayed in any part of the premises where it can readily be seen from the outside.” In other words, a California gun store cannot have an exterior sign or window display that shows or mentions a handgun.

Several gun dealers brought a <a href="https://www.calgunsfoundation.org/tracy-rifle-v-becerra">lawsuit</a> challenging the law, after California’s Bureau of Firearms issued citations to them for violating it. One of the stores had a <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thecalgunsfoundation/pages/46/attachments/original/1515793693/gov.uscourts.caed.274735.51.4.pdf?1515793693">metal sign</a> shaped like a revolver on a post in its parking lot, one had the outline of a revolver on a <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/imbert-and-smithers-san-carlos?select=hfAuylAYHMPz_LU-MrTAPw">sign</a> outside the store, and one had covered its windows with <a href="http://www.goldenstatenewspapers.com/tracy_press/news/gun-shop-owner-sues-state/article_81e95e60-6b98-11e4-bd65-73a8c62cbadc.html">vinyl decals</a> that depicted handguns.

A federal judge in the Eastern District of California recently <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thecalgunsfoundation/pages/46/attachments/original/1536697734/2018-09-11_Tracy_Rifle_MSJ_Order.pdf?1536697734">ruled</a> in the gun dealers’ favor, in <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol LLC v. Harris</em>, striking down the law on the ground that it violates freedom of speech. The judge recognized that selling handguns is a lawful activity, and there was nothing false or misleading about the stores’ advertising signs or displays. As a result, the state could justify its restriction on the dealers’ commercial expression only if it showed that the law directly advanced a substantial government interest. In the judge’s view, the state fell short of making the required showing.

At first blush, one might be tempted to think this statute is the product of some sort of anti-gun fervor in California’s liberal legislature. In fact, the provision is nearly a century old, and <a href="https://digitalcommons.du.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&amp;amp;context=law_facpub">history</a> reveals that it was enacted by Republicans at the behest of firearm enthusiasts.

The provision was enacted in 1923, at a time when Republicans dominated California politics. It was part of a model statute produced and promoted by the United States Revolver Association and later adopted as the Uniform Firearms Act by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State laws. The lead drafter of the model statute was <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/fr/karl-frederick-1.html">Karl Frederick</a>, a former Olympic gold medalist in pistol shooting and a future president of the National Rifle Association. Frederick and other gun advocates disliked the <a href="https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/100-years-ago-the-shot-that-spurred-new-yorks-gun-control-law/">Sullivan Act</a>, a New York law that required licenses for possession of handguns. Hoping to dissuade other states from following New York’s lead, the Revolver Association put the focus of its model law on enhancing punishments for criminal use of handguns. It also provided for some regulation of gun dealers, including restrictions on advertising of handguns.

When California enacted the Revolver Association’s model law, no one had much reason to be concerned about the First Amendment implications of the law’s advertising restraints. Commercial speech received <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/316/52/">no constitutional protection</a> at that time (and in any event, the First Amendment had <a href="http://todayinclh.com/?event=supreme-court-incorporates-1st-amendment-into-14th-amendment">not yet been incorporated</a> so that it would apply to state laws).

In recent decades, the Supreme Court has <a href="https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6-Rostron.pdf">struggled</a> to decide how much constitutional protection should be given to commercial speech, but at the very least a mild form of <a href="https://mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1536/central-hudson-test">intermediate scrutiny</a> applies and requires a government to have a plausible explanation for how the restriction could serve an important interest.

The California statute imposes a narrow restriction, prohibiting only exterior signs or other displays that mention or depict handguns. But the limited nature of the restriction makes it hard to see what purpose it serves. As the judge in the <em>Tracy Rifle</em> case <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thecalgunsfoundation/pages/46/attachments/original/1536697734/2018-09-11_Tracy_Rifle_MSJ_Order.pdf?1536697734">observed</a>, the California law would allow a store to have an enormous neon sign that says “GUNS GUNS GUNS” or giant pictures of rifles and shotguns. Moreover, it would allow a gun store to advertise handguns in all sorts of other ways, like blanketing a town with leaflets, putting up billboards everywhere except on the store’s premises, or running a stream of radio and television ads about handguns. It is difficult to know what can be accomplished by such a limited and selective restriction on one type of advertising of certain types of firearms.

The lawyers defending California’s law focused on the risk of suicides being committed with handguns. They <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thecalgunsfoundation/pages/46/attachments/original/1515796817/gov.uscourts.caed.274735.52.0.pdf?1515796817">argued</a> that people passing by a gun store and seeing a sign advertising handguns might be more likely to make a sudden, impulsive decision to go in and buy a handgun. The possession of the handgun then might increase the risk of suicide.

Suicide is a serious problem and researchers have found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518361/">strong </a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518361/">evidence</a> that widespread, easy access to firearms significantly contributes to this risk. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1350343/">majority</a> of firearm suicides involve handguns. Taking steps to reduce the likelihood of guns being used in suicides certainly makes sense. For example, California requires gun purchasers to <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;amp;sectionNum=26815.">wait ten days </a>before obtaining the weapon. Researchers have found that waiting period laws like this are associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4566524/">lower</a> suicide rates.

If California carefully studied the effects of firearm advertising and came up with specific regulations well tailored to reducing risks of firearm misuse, courts should give substantial deference to such a thoughtful and reasoned attempt to address a serious public health problem. The California statute struck down in the Tracy Rifle case is not such a law. It was drafted at a time when no one thought the Constitution protected commercial speech, it was intended to put some minimal regulations on gun businesses in order to discourage enactment of more significant gun control measures, and it drew a remarkably arbitrary line as to what could be put on signs or other displays at California gun shops. The court was right to strike it down, even though a more comprehensive and carefully considered regulation of gun advertising might pass constitutional muster.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world turns inward, nationalistic perspectives are on the rise. It feels like 1930, where the international order laid out in the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/treaty-of-versailles-1">Versailles Treaty</a>, was about to be turned upside down. Today, something terrible is lurking around the corner, sitting in the shadows of anarchy and fascism. The rule of law tentatively steps forward afraid of what comes next. In this kaleidoscopic age, we do not know. All the international institutions laid out after World War II are being threatened by strongmen who seek their own personal power over the backs of citizens who seem too addled by consumerism or in the depths of social media. It has become a dog eat dog world and the dogs are the new nationalistic strongmen who have risen to power in an astonishingly short period.

The cornerstones to our system of international peace and security, the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the European Union among others, are faced with the reality of a diminished role by the United States in ensuring that the rule of law remains the fundamental currency of this international order. Since 9/11, the United States’ role in international peace and security has been more of a threat to peace than as a leader and champion of the rule of law. No more so than today.

By way of example related to this diminished role, the <a href="http://www.nccit.org/">North Carolina Commission of Inquiry on Torture</a> is about to release its report on 27 September regarding the depths of the horror that was the Retention, Detention, and Interrogation Program led by the current director of the Central intelligence Agency. After the planes crashed into the buildings on that fateful September day, the United States began to slip down a slope that had no bottom. The world recoiled in horror at subsequent American policy and actions related to its misguided “war on terror.” A blind and bleeding giant, the Americans swung the club of illegality about the world trying to kill the fly that was international terrorism. The United States has never really recovered from this mindset and has lost all credibility as a nation of law.

The 21<sup>st</sup> Century has not been good to the United States and its Presidents have stumbled along trying to adjust to a new world order that they were not prepared for. They have shown the world, particularly its possible adversaries, that today it would have to move on without American leadership in maintaining the delicate balance of peace and security. American strength and resolve to uphold the rule of law was once the fulcrum that balanced the forces of good and evil that the international community struggled with during the Cold War and the kaleidoscopic age we now live in.

With the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, this slide into oblivion has accelerated. Unstable and petulant with no respect for law, he has thrown gasoline on the fire started by George W. Bush and the war on terror. Barack Obama, aware of this slide, drank the cool aid of the war on terror and did little to halt the movement away from global leadership on the rule of law. The arbitrary use of drones throughout the world and extrajudicial killings of human beings deemed “terrorist” is a good example of how much he embraced his predecessor’s policy. The fact that Guantanamo remained open under his watch moved the United States further down the dark and slippery slope of lawlessness.

Throughout this period, the rest of the world (minus China and Russia) focused on accountability and creating a system of international criminal law that was largely built by the United States. Initially begun at Nuremberg, the Americans were the leading advocates of fair and open tribunals to try those who committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and eventually genocide. In the 1990’s, but for American leadership, the likes of the courts set up for Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia, even the International Criminal Court, would not have happened. We were the master carpenters that built the house that is modern international criminal law, and yet we have just given away the keys to that house!

Recently, the United States once again has decided to drive a stake into the heart of international criminal law and accountability by attacking the International Criminal Court (ICC). <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/60674/national-security-adviser-john-bolton-remarks-international-criminal-court/">Led by</a> the National Security Advisor John Bolton, the Americans laid out a breath taking policy that would have shocked the original architect of the house the United States built at Nuremberg, Justice Robert H. Jackson.

Bolton has always wanted to destroy the ICC, beginning with the famous “<a href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/9968.htm">Bolton Letter</a>”, which practically speaking pulled the United States out of any meaningful relationship with the ICC. Though modified over time, the US has never been a leader in ensuring that the ICC succeeds. That house we build was left to others to maintain and protect, but we always kept the key, the key of United States’ adherence to the rule of law.

With Trump, Bolton, and their lack of respect of international peace and security through a global system of mutually supportive institution, based on law, we took those precious keys and threw them into the black hole of injustice. The world is now struggling with no leadership in maintaining the dignity of humanity and a respect for universal human rights. It is forced to move on, looking over its shoulder at a once great nation and a friend to the entire world.

Though not a perfect institution, the ICC is humanity’s one and only attempt to maintain a system of accountability that supports international order and the rule of law. It cannot fail. Without the ICC, we will see an acceleration of a subtle retrenchment that is going on in the new age of the dictator. The ICC is the counterweight to the likes of Li, Putin, Trump, Duterte, el-Sisi, Maduro, Erdogan, among other strongmen who view the world with a skewed nationalistic lens. A noble institution that the vast majority of the world has created to ensure the beast of impunity is reigned in and that the bright light of the law shines into the dark corners where these misguided leaders dwell; the ICC must remain! Without the ICC, the jackboots of anarchy will march out of those shadows and onto the world stage in a way that may not be controllable. We need that house the United States built despite American efforts to tear it down.

As declared by Justice Robert H. Jackson: <em>There is no such thing as an achieved liberty; like electricity, there can be no substantial storage and it must be generated as it is enjoyed, or the lights go out</em>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On September 17, 2018, the U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly (99-1) in support of the <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2680/text/is">Opioid Crisis Response Act (OCRA) of 2018</a></span>. OCRA proposes a series of measures addressing the devastating, long-term impacts of opioid addiction and abuse nationally. Building on efforts previously authorized in 2016 via the <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/524/text">Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)</a></span> and the <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/34/text">21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act</a></span>, OCRA seeks to launch and fund an array of opioid prevention and response efforts through multiple federal agencies in collaboration with state and local governments.

One of OCRA’s prime sponsors, Senator Lamar Alexander (R. Tenn) <span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/19/donald-trump-opioid-crisis-epidemic-addiction-nalaxone-heroine-column/1347574002/">noted</a></span> recently “The challenge of solving the opioid crisis has often been described as needing a moonshot.” To be sure, an epidemic that has taken nearly 20 years to reach its apex (hopefully) cannot be remedied through solitary acts of Congress. OCRA’s proposed measures, detailed below, are based on a series of bipartisan hearings and unquestionably well-intended.  Someday, they may even help curtail opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the U.S.

Today, however, <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ondcp/commission-interim-report.pdf">150 more Americans</a></span> will succumb to opioid addiction or misuse. Since the epidemic’s inception in 1999 to 2017, approximately <span>670,000 lives</span> have been lost to abuse and misuse of these drugs in <span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids">prescription</a></span> (e.g. oxycodone, morphine, methadone) and <span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids">illicit</a></span> (e.g. heroin, fentanyl) forms. Hundreds of thousands more are <span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html">admitted</a></span> each year to emergency departments or seek life-saving treatments. When the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a <span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opioid%20PHE%20Declaration-no-sig.pdf">national state of public health emergency</a></span> (PHE) on October 26, 2017, the epidemic was instantly established as the worst ever PHE since the term originated in 2001. Sadly, without substantial and immediate public health interventions, millions of current and future opioid users will continue to face severe physical and mental impacts.

Like many Americans, <span><a href="http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/Opioid+Poll.pdf">chances</a></span> are you know or have witnessed someone who is at risk of, or died from, opioid abuse. These contemporary deaths are preventable but require significantly greater efforts and resources than Congress promises via OCRA. As examined below, its plan to address the opioid epidemic has long-term possibilities, but tens of thousands of Americans may die in the short-term waiting for federal collaborative efforts to take effect.

<strong>OCRA’s Premier Objectives </strong>

The Senate’s version of OCRA centers on several core themes including reduction of opioid supplies, enhanced access to treatment and recovery services, protection of youth and their families, and development of opioid alternatives.

<em>Regulation of Opioid Supplies.</em> Among several provisions designed to limit supplies, OCRA promises more funds for law enforcement task forces working in prominent drug trafficking areas. OCRA incorporates provisions of the previously proposed <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/372/text">Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act</a></span> directing the U.S. Postal Service to inspect foreign packages to help detect opioid importation. Detecting and seizing opioids may be furthered through greater collaboration between Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

FDA may also require opioid manufacturers to (a) package opioids in small-dose blister packs (<span><a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2017/11/3/fda-may-require-opioids-be-packaged-in-blister-packs">to encourage truncated</a> opioid use</span>) and (b) develop patient disposal methods to prevent diversion of unused product. Federal support of state-based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are intended to buttress efforts to better assess and combat opioid misuse.

<em>Treatment and Recovery.</em> OCRA includes limited proposals on treatment and recovery efforts:
<ol>
 	<li>HHS is directed to develop guidelines for emergency treatment of patients with opioid-related overdoses;</li>
 	<li>Access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is expanded through approaches like medication-assisted treatment and telemedicine;</li>
 	<li>Development of opioid recovery centers are funded through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA); and</li>
 	<li>Reauthorization of the <span><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/ti-17-015">Building Communities of Recovery Program</a></span> for peer support groups entailed in recovery services.</li>
</ol>
<em>Infant, Youth, and Family Services:</em> Congress has expressed strong interests in protecting <span><a href="https://www.childtrends.org/child-trends-5/5-things-know-opioid-epidemic-effect-children">infants, youth, and their families</a></span> from the effects of opioid use. OCRA supports state-based efforts to improve care of substance-exposed infants. HHS is mandated to issue strategies for preventing prenatal substance use as well as guidance for how states can help keep families together during treatment. Preventing opioid use among youth is advanced through various avenues including a proposed Drug-Free Communities Program.

<em>Long-Term Opioid Alternatives:</em> Among other provisions, OCRA allows the National Institutes of Health to fund the development of new, non-addictive painkillers. Meanwhile, HHS is instructed to assist hospitals and other acute care settings treat <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/opinion/prescription-opioid-crisis.html">millions of Americans</a></span> needing pain management services.

<strong>OCRA’s Failings to Save Lives Now</strong>

On the front lines of the epidemic, state and local governments have been working for years on <span><a href="https://www.networkforphl.org/_asset/6pntam/Western-Region-Primer---Opioids-8-31-18.pdf">various efforts</a></span> to confront the root causes of opioid morbidity and mortality. Like HHS, 8 states have separately declared emergencies. Many have approved naloxone standing orders and first responder ability to carry and distribute life-saving naloxone. States have increased treatment funding, restricted opioid prescribing, advocated for interagency coordination, and enhanced PDMP surveillance. Some states and localities are even considering establishing safe injection facilities (SIFs). The dominant, driving goal of these measures is to save lives now.

In its current iteration, OCRA falls well short of achieving this same goal. For starters, Congress’ paltry funding commitments inadequately address the crisis head on. The Congressional Budget Office <span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2018-07/s2680.pdf">estimated</a></span> that a prior version of OCRA would authorize only about $8 billion in funding across multiple federal agencies. This amount pales in comparison to the <span><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/funding/budget">$26 billion spent annually</a></span> on HIV/AIDS programs. It is also a pittance compared to the estimated <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/The%20Underestimated%20Cost%20of%20the%20Opioid%20Crisis.pdf">$504 billion of economic cost</a>s</span> of the opioid crisis (estimated in 2015). The nation’s worst public health crisis requires significant resources, not Congressional “pocket change,” for public health prevention and response efforts.

Excess American mortality may be tied to this gross funding failure alone. However, OCRA’s proposed allocation of federal funding is also skewed. Some funds support immediate SUD treatment, such as reauthorizing the <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ255/PLAW-114publ255.pdf">21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2af32e85-edde-427a-8f61-df2b2612327e/section-by-section-9.6.pdf">approving SAMSHA’s comprehensive opioid recovery centers</a></span>. Considerably more of OCRA’s proposed funding addresses <span><a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2af32e85-edde-427a-8f61-df2b2612327e/section-by-section-9.6.pdf">non-treatment related efforts</a></span> like drug courts, law enforcement protections against non-intentional narcotic exposures, and a pilot program to provide temporary housing for recovered users.  These are meaningful efforts, but they will not prevent tomorrow’s opioid deaths.

Although <span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/opioid-overdose-reversal-naloxone-narcan-evzio">naloxone</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine">buprenorphine</a></span> help substance users wean off opioids and reverse overdose effects, OCRA does not adequately increase access to these medications. Congress could have used federal purchasing power to buy and distribute mass quantities of naloxone to areas in need. Instead, OCRA merely expands meager naloxone provisions of <span>CARA</span>. In addition, qualified physicians are permitted to prescribe buprenorphine and methadone to <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-health-202/2018/09/17/the-health-202-senators-to-vote-on-opioid-package-but-big-hurdles-remain/5b9bd4361b326b47ec9595f7/?utm_term=.b7d8788747e7">only 100 patients</a></span>. OCRA <span><a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2af32e85-edde-427a-8f61-df2b2612327e/section-by-section-9.6.pdf">narrowly increases this limit to 275</a> patients</span>. This falls well shy of needs among rural patients hardest hit by the epidemic due largely to their  lack of access to qualified physicians.

<span><a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2af32e85-edde-427a-8f61-df2b2612327e/section-by-section-9.6.pdf">FDA clarifications</a></span> on prescription packaging specified in OCRA are deficient. OCRA authorizes FDA to require opioid blister packs. Yet, it does not limit opioid dosage or diagnoses even though patients prescribed lower doses of opioids are <span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6610a1.htm">less likely</a></span> to subsequently misuse opioids. <span><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/prescribing-policies-states-confront-opioid-overdose-epidemic.aspx">Over half</a></span> the states have enacted various opioid prescribing limitations. Congress should instruct all states to consider similar limitations consistent with emerging standards of care that counter-balance patients’ legitimate claims to access opioids where warranted to treat chronic or temporary pain.
<p style="text-align: center">_______________________</p>
As Americans’ brutal battle with opioids extends into its third decade, the time for massive federal infusion of resources and life-saving interventions is now.  The public health repercussions may only worsen as newly-developed, more potent illicit opioids arrive from overseas. Congress’ vision for addressing the impacts of the opioid epidemic are forward-thinking, but persons at risk of opioid misuse deserve immediate access to life-saving treatment and assistance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week the Supreme Court gave the green light to stemming the tide of dark money being pumped into our political system.

Last month the United States District Court for the District of Columbia made a sound and rational decision to help protect our democracy from an onslaught of dark money as we approach the 2018 midterm elections. The decision was <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnKaJvQW4AAY-Bx.jpg">stayed</a> by Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court. Nonetheless, it appeared that this order from Chief Justice Roberts would not go into effect and the public would continue to be kept in the dark about much of the money being spent to persuade them to vote for or against federal candidates. However, at the last moment the full Supreme Court intervened and decided that the district court decision would go into effect.

In August of this year, D.C. District Chief Judge Beryl Howell <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4887735-CREW-v-FEC-Opinion-080318.html">concluded</a> that a Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) regulation allowed certain groups, like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, to hide the identity of their donors when that information should in fact be disclosed. Howell’s ruling overturned a FEC regulation providing that independent expenditure groups, like Crossroads GPS, only had to disclose their donors if the donation was intended for a specific political communication.

The FEC <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/nonprof_summ.php">regulation</a> at issue applied to many groups organized as 501(c)4 non-profit corporations who are pumping large undisclosed sums into our political system. These are social welfare organizations who are allowed to engage in political activity (such as spending money on ads urging people to vote for or against political candidates) as long as that activity does not become its “<a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/other-non-profits/social-welfare-organizations">primary activity</a>.” The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has therefore essentially allowed these so-called social welfare organizations to, at least in part, function like political committees as long as spending money on political ads constitutes less than half of its activities. One of the big differences between a political committee and a<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/527s/types.php"> social welfare organization</a> is that political committees must disclose their donors, while social welfare organizations do not.

The ability to spend money on political ads through social welfare non-profits represents an enormous opportunity for donors who wish to remain anonymous. Social welfare non-profits can essentially serve as a <a href="https://psmag.com/economics/the-irs-failings-go-far-beyond-targeting-conservative-groups-58696">cloaking device</a> that protects political spenders from having to reveal their identities.

Howell concluded that the FEC’s rule made little sense and thwarted congressional intent when it comes to campaign disclosure. Howell’s ruling gave the FEC the opportunity to pass a new rule that was consistent with his ruling. However, it will not shock anyone who follows the FEC to know that they failed to <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/its-worse-dysfunctional">pass</a> a new rule. If it would have passed, the ruling would have taken effect this week.

Howell’s ruling invalidating the FEC regulation would have been a huge win for the public as we enter the final stretch of the midterm elections. <a href="http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/276323/27046979/1464362357973/04_Levinson+FINAL.pdf?token=4brULxa286DfMxoB%2BrabdS401sU%3D">Disclosure laws</a> serve important purposes like providing the public with more information about who is trying to sway their ballot box decisions and providing a service in attempts to reduce corruption or the appearance of corruption. Given our current news cycle, this issue has taken on an urgent importance.

But before the ruling could go into effect, Crossroads GPS asked the D.C. Court of Appeals to halt Howell’s decision. The D.C. Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000165-dfd1-d1f3-a36d-dff13e680001">declined</a> to do so. The Supreme Court was the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4887732-18A274-Stay-App.html">only option</a> left for Crossroads GPS and they filed emergency stay with the high court. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/reportersguide.pdf">Requests</a> for emergency stays are sent directly to an individual justice in charge of that circuit.

Chief Justice Roberts is responsible for all emergency stay requests coming out of the D.C. Circuit. He had the option of ruling on the request on his own or referring the request to the full court. He chose the first option. For the following few days it looked like Crossroads GPS won its argument that the lower court ruling cannot go into effect.

However, the full Supreme Court intervened and demonstrated that there may be some dissension in the ranks because the full court vacated Roberts’ stay. This result indicates that the lower court decision will go into effect and the public will obtain more information about how campaign finance contributions are attempting to affect their ballot box decisions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The joy and amazement Second Amendment supporters felt in July at two <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit Appeals Court</a> [Official website] opinions were dashed in August when, in <em><a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/08/03/15-15449.pdf">Pena v. Lindley</a> </em>[PDF, text] the Ninth Circuit upheld California’s Unsafe Handgun Act banning purchase of new handguns that lack technology no current gun has and no manufacturer is contemplating. Although the two July opinions were modest and commonsensical, the <em>Pena </em>opinion blatantly defies the Supreme Court’s ruling in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf"><em>District of Columbia v. Heller </em></a>[PDF, text] that there is a right to keep and bear those guns in common use for self-defense and other lawful purposes.

Before turning to the <em>Pena </em>decision it's helpful to take a quick look at the two Ninth Circuit opinions that adhered to the Supreme Court’s affirmation of the right to keep and bear arms. On July 17<sup>th</sup> in <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2018/07/17/17-56081.pdf"><em>Duncan v. Becerra</em></a> [PDF, text] a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked California’s confiscation of “large-capacity” magazines, those holding more than ten rounds. While these magazines had been banned by the state in 2000, California had permitted the hundreds of thousands of owners in the state who already had them to keep them. But the new law criminalized possession of these legally purchased magazines and required owners to get rid of them by sending them out of the state, destroying them, altering them to hold less than ten rounds, or turning them in to the police. Refusal risked fines of $100 and up to a year in jail. In imposing the injunction the district judge pointed out that the state’s “desire to criminalize simple possession of a firearm magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds is precisely the type of policy choice that the Constitution takes off the table.” Now, a year later, the Court of Appeals has upheld that injunction finding “the right to possess firearms for protection implied a corresponding right to obtain the bullets necessary to use them” and that the new law deprived Plaintiffs “not just of the <em>use </em>of their property, but of <em>possession, </em>one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of property rights.”

<a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/07/24/12-17808.pdf"><em>Young v. State of Hawaii</em></a> [PDF, text] the second victory, was less impressive than it seemed and demonstrates the lengths to which states have gone to abridge the right to bear arms. Both California and Hawaii <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=26350">ban</a> [California Penal Code 26350] open carry of firearms, but also strictly limit the ability to carry a concealed weapon. Should an applicant for a concealed carry permit convince the Hawaiian police he or she has reason to fear specific injury, the license is good only within the county issuing the permit. When George Young, a Hawaiian resident, was unable to persuade the police and district court of his need to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense, he sued for the right to carry a firearm openly. In July two of the three Appellate Court judges who heard the case agreed “The right to bear arms must include, at the least, the right to carry a firearm openly for self-defense” and remanded the case adding that a state could regulate gun carriage as long as the regulations did not render the right an “illusory promise.”

But the bubble of common sense jurisprudence burst on August 13<sup>th</sup> with the panel decision in <em>Pena </em>upholding the constitutionality of three challenged provisions of California’s Unsafe Handgun Act. California maintains a roster of guns that can legally be purchased in the state. The Unsafe Handgun Act now mandates that new handguns must indicate when a bullet is loaded in the chamber. Second, new guns must have a detachable mechanism to prevent the gun from discharging when a magazine is not in it. Lastly, new handguns must stamp “microscopically the handgun’s make, model, and serial number onto each fired shell casing.” The judges conceded that “no handguns were available in the United States that met the microstamping requirements,” but added that “simply because no gun manufacturer is `even considering trying’ to implement the technology, it does not follow that microstamping is technologically infeasible.” In short Californians are free to buy handguns that do not exist. The roster of legal firearms which, by the way manufacturers must pay to have their weapons on, is already shrinking. In the four years from 2013 to 2017 more than 500 models vanished from the list, including some of the most popular guns. The judges do not see that as a problem arguing it is not “the number of handguns on the roster that matter, it is the impact on self-defense in the home.”

But what of the <em>Heller </em>opinion’s explicit right to “keep and bear those guns in common use for self-defense and other lawful purposes?” The panel responds that they did not “reach the question of whether the challenged provisions fell within the scope of the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms because, even assuming coverage, the provisions passed constitutional muster” since “the Act only regulates commercial sales, not possession, and does so in a way that does not impose a substantial burden on purchasers.” Apparently as long as there are some guns to purchase—possession is not involved-- and new handguns meeting futuristic requirements might be manufactured some day the constitutional right of Californians to keep and bear arms for self defence is not infringed.

In California the Second Amendment is not only being treated as a second-class right, but with the approval of the Ninth Circuit it is being treated as no right at all. The only hope for residents is that the Supreme Court grants certiorari.   But the Court has been reluctant to hear these cases and as the late Ninth Circuit Judge Stephen Reinhardt famously responded about his circuits’ decisions being overturned, “They can’t catch `em all.” Let’s hope they catch this one.<a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"><span></span></a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The September 2018 <a href="http://michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Tracy-Rifle-v.-Harris_Memorandum-Decision-Affirming-District-Court-Order.pdf">decision</a> of Federal District Judge Troy Nunley in <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol LLC v. Harris </em>is noteworthy for at least two reasons.

First, the decision invalidated a <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-6/26800-26915/26820">California law</a> prohibiting firearms retailers from displaying on the exterior of their premises any readily visible “handgun or imitation handgun, or placard advertising the sale or other transfer thereof.” In doing this, <em>Tracy </em><em>Rifle and Pistol</em> joins a growing list of lawsuits challenging state and local gun-control laws in the aftermath of a pair of Supreme Court decisions expanding the Second Amendment right to “keep and bear Arms.”

Second, <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol</em> is a textbook illustration of the specialized, and in some ways awkward, place of commercial speech/advertising in the First Amendment pantheon. The case is a reminder of the extensive and subjective policy-making discretion the “intermediate” commercial-speech standards afford to judges.

<em><u>The Context and Essence of the </u></em><u>Tracy Rifle and Pistol <em>Ruling</em></u>

The case of <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol</em> arose after inspectors from the California Department of Justice cited three gun-sales businesses for violating California law by having a metal parking-lot sign and a logo shaped like a revolver and exterior-window decals depicting handguns. Wishing to continue these advertising practices, the businesses and their owners filed suit.

In granting summary judgment to the objecting businesses and owners, Judge Nunley recognized that California’s law burdened their commercial-free-speech rights. Applying the four-part constitutional test for commercial speech the Supreme Court articulated in 1980 (as analyzed below), the Judge found that the challenged California law did not sufficiently advance California’s admittedly “substantial” regulatory interests – reducing handgun suicide and handgun crime. Judge Nunley found that the law was “fatally underinclusive” (i.e., too selective and incomplete) and unconstitutionally “overinclusive” (i.e., more extensive than necessary, because California had effective, less-speech-suppressive alternatives).

<em><u>Another California Gun-Control Decision – with a twist…</u></em>

As one of the strictest gun-control states, California has generated several high-profile decisions in recent years about the scope and legitimacy of gun control. Controversies have arisen especially since the 2008 <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/554/570/">decision</a> in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller</em>, which held that the Second Amendment’s “central component” guaranteed a right of self-defense and home protection unmoored to service in a “well-regulated Militia” (as the Amendment’s preface puts it), and the 2010 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2009/08-1521">decision</a> in <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago</em>, which applied <em>Heller’s</em> re-invigorated private-self-defense right to state and local gun-control laws.

As <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/09/federal-judge-rules-against-california-gun-ad-law/">past</a>  <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/09/federal-judge-rules-against-california-gun-ad-law/california-gun_-dealers-win_-suit_-over_-window-advertising-argument-1/">JURIST</a>  postings have noted, two especially high-profile challenges to California laws have split different federal district and appellate judges. These cases led to strenuous protests by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas when his colleagues failed to grant Supreme Court review. The two cases: <em><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/10-56971/10-56971-2016-06-09.html">Peruta v. County of San Diego</a></em>, which upheld very restrictive standards used by several urban county sheriffs in granting concealed-weapons permits, and <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17-342">Silvester v. Harris</a></em>, which validated California’s lengthy ten-day waiting period for handgun purchases, even as applied to repeat customers whose backgrounds had already been checked.

<u>Tracy Rifle and Pistol<em> as Illustration: An Awkwardly Positioned and Value-Laden Doctrine</em></u>

Of course, <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol</em> is not technically a Second-Amendment challenge; it relies on the Amendment that got “first billing” in the Bill of Rights. Still, the recent decision is an example of how, in the post-<em>Heller/McDonald </em>era, other relevant constitutional provisions can be pressed into service to protect an activity (handgun purchases) that Judge Nunley described as “not only…lawful, [but also] constitutionally protected.”

“Commercial speech” occupies a strange rung on the ladder of constitutional free-speech protections. Until the 1970’s, advertising (like obscenity and defamation) was speech without any First-Amendment protection. In the shadow of the consumer-rights movement, the Court in the 1970’s laid the foundation for substantial constitutional protection of speech that “proposes a commercial transaction.”

The 1980 decision in <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/447/557">Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y.</a> </em>elaborated a four-part test.  The <em>Central Hudson</em> test provides that a governmental unit can only regulate (1) “non-misleading” advertising of a “lawful” product if (2) government has “substantial” interests that are (3) “directly” and “materially” advanced by the regulation, which (4) must be “no more extensive than necessary” to further the government’s interests.

Notably, this potentially potent protection is not intended to be as robust as the “strict scrutiny” modern Free-Speech doctrines afford to other (non-commercial) content-based regulation.  For example, if California sought to regulate political speech about gun-control, a scholarly paper about the causes of gun violence, or a performance-art piece about school shootings, government would need a stronger interest (“compelling”) and the fit between the government’s goals and the regulation would be more tightly scrutinized (under a “least restrictive means” test).

Which leads directly to the point that, compared to the analysis brought to other content-based speech regulation (in which strict scrutiny typically dooms the regulation), scrutiny of regulation based on commercial content is more uncertain; it leaves substantial running room for judicial discretion and varying value judgements. <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol </em>provides a perfect example.

Once he drew the obvious conclusion that handgun sales were lawful and that using gun shapes and truthful placards to advertise was not “misleading” (<em>Central Hudson</em> prong 1), Judge Nunley did what most evaluators do when assessing the substantiality of government interests (prong 2): he analyzed the anti-suicide and anti-gun-violence interests in the abstract and in one short paragraph credited them as obviously “substantial.”

Where the rubber met the road, as often happens in commercial-speech cases, is with the remaining two <em>Central Hudson</em> criteria. Reasonable jurists can differ about whether a regulation advances government’s interests (prong 3) “directly” -- as opposed to peripherally -- and “materially” -- as opposed to insignificantly or not at all.  And the heart of the 4<sup>th</sup> <em>Central Hudson </em>prong turns on whether government has other options that would actually advance its interests with less Free-Speech damage. This requires sophisticated comparison of the pros and cons of government’s choice of regulatory means versus the merits and demerits of existing laws or other potentially viable approaches.

To provide just two of many examples from <em>Tracy Rifle and Pistol</em>:

<em>First, Direct/Material advancement</em>: In connecting its regulation of gun-dealer advertising to its concern about gun-related suicide and violence, California relied on two expert witnesses to support its arguments that ad restrictions “inhibit [gun] purchases by people with impulsive personality traits” and therefore reduce the ready gun access that would enable these people to commit suicide or gun violence.  Among his reasons for pooh-poohing the strength of this causal argument, Judge Nunley reasoned that California’s existing ten-day waiting period for background checks would prevent immediately impulsive gun use and that the link between current impulsive acquisition of a gun and its use “at some unspecified future time likely years later” was just too indirect.  Judge Nunley also strongly applied to the subset of the population with impulsivity issues a general commercial-speech principle -- that it is unacceptably paternalistic to ban particular commercial content based on the “fear that people would make bad decisions” if given the information.

Another judge might well have weighed the factors differently, more charitably crediting California’s chain of reasoning.  Another judge might have found paternalism more appropriate for an especially vulnerable subset of Californians or discounted the extent of information present in a pistol-shaped sign or “Guns for Sale” placard.

<em>Secondly, more Extensive than Necessary/Other Options</em>: On prong 4 Judge Nunley concluded that California’s existing ten-day waiting period for acquiring firearms, its limit on handgun purchases to one gun in any thirty-day period, and its requirement that gun purchasers complete firearm-safety courses combine to “act directly to deter the potential harmful consequences of handgun purchases.”  So, the challenged law was unnecessary.  Judge Nunley also posited that California could instead “run an educational campaign focused on the dangers of handguns or the consequences of impulsive decision making.”

Again, another judge might assess the alternatives as less promising or California’s approach as more worthy of credence.

Judge Nunley’s handling of these and other commercial-speech issues is more than plausible; in my view, his analysis is the sounder one.  Here I’m making a different point – that reasonable judicial minds can differ more in this area than in many others.

After all, the bases on which judges might differ under <em>Central Hudson </em>are classic matters of <em>non-judicial</em> judgment more typically associated with elected and appointed <em>policy-makers</em>.  In our constitutional democracy, legislators and administrative rule-makers typically assess the relative costs and benefits and efficacy of different proposed courses of action.

The current commercial-speech doctrine might obligate judges to act outside of their judicial comfort zone.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After being detained for one year, the court released 17 lawyers held in custody in Turkey, but it was short-lived. Their release was pending on the final outcome of the trial, but within 24 hours of that decision, judges already started to reverse course due to the prosecutor’s objection. Since the*n, six lawyers were re-arrested, and six others had arrest warrants issued. The alleged offenses are simply for the practice of law as a profession.

The accused are members of the Progressive Lawyers Association in Turkey (ÇHD), including ÇHD President, Selçuk Kozağaçlı. ÇHD is one of many organizations that were <span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-idUSKBN1370DP">shut down</a></span> by Erdogan since the attempted coup in the summer of 2016. The majority of the accused also work for the People’s Law Office.

Most of the lawyers were taken into custody on September 12, 2017, when police raided their houses and offices. Selçuk Kozagaçli was arrested on November 8, 2017, in Istanbul. He was preparing to attend a meeting about attacks on human rights defenders. The lawyers were charged with founding, directing, or being a member of an “illegal” organization. The first hearing since their arrest over a year ago was held between September 10 and 14, 2018.

<strong>My Observations and Thoughts from the Trial:</strong>

On September 10 and 11, I was among a group of international observers who were present for the trial of the 17 lawyers at Istanbul’s High Criminal Court.

During the whole trial, there was an extremely high level of police presence including scores of counter-terrorist police forces. The defense lawyers objected to the presence of such high numbers of police as intimidating for the defendants, but the court did not order any changes.

Then, the accused lawyers made their case.

Selçuk Kozagaçli started out by speaking of the beatings by the police and the torture that they had suffered. He stated, "we have been beaten and tortured by police as is common practice in Turkey." Kozagaçli asked why the government was going after lawyers. He concluded his defense by saying to the judges “if you keep us in prison, do not cite any legal grounds, because no legal basis exists for keeping us imprisoned.”

Others spoke about the experience of being subjected to solitary confinement. At least two of them were isolated in the prison for months.

As the lawyers were concluding their cases, one of the witnesses called out, “the poor people in Turkey support you!”

All accusations against the lawyers are directly about their activities as lawyers. In the indictment, it is claimed that the defendants counseled detained people accused of membership in a banned Turkish organization. The lawyers are charged with visiting these individuals in prison and offering legal support. The indictment states they enabled their clients to invoke "the right to remain silent." Also, the lawyers allegedly helped the imprisoned communicate with the outside. One lawyer testified that attending the funeral of a client was cited as evidence of terrorist activity against her.

The government had six secret witnesses against the defendants. The defense counsel did not even know the witnesses' identity or the content of their testimonies.

As I was bearing witness to this travesty of justice, I recalled the US-based National Lawyers Guild (NLG), of which I am a member. NLG was founded in 1937 as a movement lawyering bar association. During the McCarthy era, membership dropped from several thousand to 500. NLG was almost banned and about to be listed as a “subversive” organization by the Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. Members were apprehensive due to very real repercussions, namely losing their jobs and livelihoods.

The NLG was targeted because of its significant role in defending social justice movements and freedom fighters. The Erdogan regime is targeting ÇHD and People’s Law Office members for similar reasons: it is afraid of movement from lawyers who are resisting the regime’s campaign of systematic repression.

As he was being re-arrested, Selçuk Kozağaçlı conveyed to his supporters, “the discussions about respecting the law do not make sense where the courts act as the puppets of political power.”

The lawyers' targeting fits into the broader context of mass arrests and jailing by the Erdogan government after the coup attempt. As of last year, it was estimated that <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/14/europe/turkey-failed-coup-arrests-detained/index.html">arrests could total up to 47,000</a>.

The Erdogan government must be exposed and held accountable. The lawyers and others must be immediately released and the bogus charges against them dropped.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month, Congress sent a sweeping legislative package aimed at curbing the opioid epidemic to President Trump’s desk for signature, and the President has said he intends to sign it. Despite the increasing rancor that has poisoned so much our political discourse, the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180924/HR6.pdf">Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act</a> (the SUPPORT Act) sped through Congress, winning approval <a href="https://apnews.com/922a008618fd4f2b9674297cfb5459a1">by a vote</a> of 393 to 8 in the House on Sept 28, and 98 to 1 in the Senate on October 3. Unlike most of the hot-button issues facing Congress today, the opioid epidemic is a truly bipartisan issue. Democrats and Republicans agree that government action is required to stem the tide of overdose deaths that reached <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">more than 72,000</a> in 2017. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">More than two-thirds</a> of those overdose deaths were due to opioids, including prescription pain pills, heroin, and fentanyl.

The bill was sent to the President’s desk approximately one year after he declared the opioid epidemic a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html">Public Health Emergency</a>. It includes 72 separate proposals sponsored by legislators in both houses of Congress, many of whom are up for re-election next month. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-addiction-in-u-s-7-in-10-say-its-a-very-serious-problem-cbs-news-poll/">Polls</a> indicate that voters view the opioid crisis as a serious problem and believe the federal government should be doing more to combat it.

The SUPPORT Act is extremely broad. It <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/03/senate-is-poised-send-sweeping-opioids-legislation-president-trump/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f9545ea6e3ab">“creates, expands and reauthorizes programs and policies across almost every federal agency.”</a> Among other things, it reauthorizes funding for the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr34/BILLS-114hr34enr.pdf">21<sup>st</sup> Century CURES Act</a>, which provided $500 million per year to states to combat the opioid crisis. It also provides support in the following areas:

<strong>Access to Treatment. </strong>It is estimated that <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-FFR1-2016/NSDUH-FFR1-2016.pdf">over 20 million Americans</a> are currently struggling with substance use disorder. Not surprisingly, communities are having trouble finding enough treatment beds and trained addiction professionals to serve the need. Moreover, addiction has historically been treated less favorably by private insurers and Medicaid/ Medicare programs than other chronic diseases. Although such disfavored treatment is unlawful, there are <a href="http://atforum.com/2016/03/federal-investigation-reveals-parity-violations/">reported cases</a> of insurance companies refusing to cover costs of necessary care. These issues contribute to the fact that only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/substance-abuse-surgeon-general-report.html/">one in ten people</a> who need addiction treatment actually receives it.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Increased access to inpatient rehab facilities:</strong> Under current law, treatment centers with more than 16 beds are not permitted to bill Medicaid for residential services, a situation which severely limits the number of beds available to low-income individuals. The SUPPORT Act repeals the 16-bed Medicaid rule for five years, opening these facilities up to patients needing addiction treatment and permitting stays of up to 30 days. It also expands the availability of Medicare dollars to treat opioid use disorder.</li>
 	<li><strong>Ensuring adequate treatment services.</strong> The SUPPORT Act requires federal review of addiction treatment facilities to assess adequacy of treatment and funding needs. It also requires federal agencies to provide information to Congress regarding insurers who are noncompliant with coverage requirements for addiction treatment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Expansion of Addiction Treatment Workforce: </strong>The SUPPORT Act provides a student loan repayment program for addiction treatment professionals working in areas hardest hit by drug overdoses, and where there is a shortage of treatment professionals.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hospital Emergency Rooms: </strong>Too often, when an addicted person overdoses and ends up in a hospital emergency room, he is stabilized and released with nothing more than a list of phone numbers for treatment programs. And too often, the person fails to follow up with the listed providers, goes back to using, and overdoses again. The SUPPORT Act seeks to address this by offering grant money for the development of protocols that will provide a bridge from the emergency room to addiction treatment.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Access to Opioid Addiction Medications</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Opioid-substitution medications such as buprenorphine (Suboxone) and methadone are considered essential tools for the treatment of opioid use disorder, but these medications are often stigmatized among treatment professionals and the recovery community as “trading one addiction for another.” This stigma exists despite <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2016/11/medication-assisted-treatment-improves-outcomes-for-patients-with-opioid-use-disorder">multiple studies</a> that show better results, in terms of treatment retention, relapse avoidance, and mortality, than most abstinence-based programs. Federal law requires physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners to undergo special training in order to prescribe buprenorphine, and limits the number of patients each prescriber can have. The SUPPORT Act seeks to increase access to buprenorphine by allowing more types of health care practitioners to prescribe it, and by providing grant money to encourage newly graduated physicians to obtain the training.</li>
 	<li>Naloxone, commonly known by its brand name “Narcan”, is a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses. It is safe to use, non-addictive, and can be easily administered. In an overdose situation, seconds can mean the difference between life and death, so first responders such as police officers are increasingly being equipped with the drug. The SUPPORT Act expands a program that encourages first responders to carry and use naloxone.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sober Housing and Recovery Support Services </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>“Recovery homes” provide housing for people in early recovery where they can gain strength in their sobriety. Unfortunately, such homes are subject to few regulations in most states, and this can create situations ripe for abuse. Further, the cost of recovery housing is generally not covered by private or public insurance, which can limit access.</li>
 	<li>The SUPPORT Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services to issue best practices for operating recovery housing, and to assist those recovering from opioid addiction with housing costs. The Act also offers support for a variety of recovery support services, as well as grants for programs to help recovering people transition to independent living.</li>
 	<li><strong>Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers: </strong>The SUPPORT Act provides grant funding for the creation of centers that will provide a full range of treatment and recovery services, including medication-assisted treatment, recovery housing, job training, counseling, and peer recovery support services. The Act further supports the expansion of telemedicine to reach rural and other areas where addiction treatment resources are limited.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Enforcement and Prevention</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cutting Off the Flow of Fentanyl: </strong>The opioid epidemic has progressed through <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html">three waves</a>, each driven by a different type of opioid. The first wave was driven by prescription pain pills like Vicodin and OxyContin, which caused the majority of opioid overdose deaths from 1999 to 2010. The second wave began in 2011, as physicians began to decrease opioid prescribing and opioid addicts migrated to heroin, leading to a surge in heroin overdose deaths from 2011 to 2015. In 2013, the third wave began as synthetic opioids like fentanyl flooded the market. Fentanyl is much stronger than heroin – only a few grains can cause overdose in those without opioid tolerance. In 2013, there were approximately 3000 deaths due to fentanyl; that number skyrocketed to nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html">30,000 in 2017</a>.</li>
 	<li>Much of the fentanyl entering the United States is coming from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-05-22/deadly-chinese-fentanyl-is-creating-a-new-era-of-drug-kingpins">China</a> through the postal service. The SUPPORT Act imposes new requirements on federal agencies, including the Post Office, to help stop the influx of fentanyl at the border, and provides agencies with new tools to improve detection and testing at the border.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reducing Opioid Prescribing. </strong>The SUPPORT Act provides increased penalties for drug manufacturers and distributors related to the overprescribing of opioids. It also provides grants for education and training of health care professionals on proper pain management, the dangers of opioid misuse, and early warning signs of opioid use disorder. Further, the Act provides support for research and development of new, non-opioid pain relievers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Youth Programs: </strong>Prevention is an important part of curbing overdose deaths. The SUPPORT Act requires the Department of Health and Human Services to disseminate best practices for youth prevention, and provides grant money for drug education programs for youth and young adults, including funding for collegiate recovery programs. It also provides support for children at risk of entering foster care, or in foster care, as a result of a parent’s addiction.</li>
</ul>
The breadth of the SUPPORT Act is encouraging, as it demonstrates the federal government’s awareness of the many factors contributing to the overdose crisis. On the other hand, some argue that it spreads too little money across too many policies and programs; a more targeted approach providing increased funding for fewer high-priority items might be more successful.

Most of the funding included in the new legislation consists of grant authorizations, not guaranteed dollars. Congress will need to appropriate money to fund the grant authorizations through spending bills. So far this year, Congress has appropriated approximately <a href="http://outbreaknewstoday.com/opioid-epidemic-senate-passes-support-patients-communities-act-58037/">$8.5 billion</a> for opioid-related programs, but there is no guarantee of funding for future years. Experts say that turning the tide on the epidemic will require much more money than this, and some have suggested that even <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/12/17847358/senate-opioid-crisis-response-act">$100 billion over five years</a> – which is comparable to the amount the United States spends on HIV/AIDS – may not be sufficient.

In addition to the lack of appropriated funds, much of the new funding authorized by the SUPPORT Act is for pilot programs, which means that it is of limited duration. This can create a disincentive for eligible organizations to invest time, energy, and resources to develop programs when they don’t know if there will be money to continue the programs in the long term.

Finally, some critics are disappointed that a popular provision in the House bill didn’t make the cut in the final compromise package – a provision for the responsible sharing of a patient’s addiction treatment information. More than 40 years ago, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/part-2">regulations</a> were enacted that provided for heightened protection of a patient’s addiction treatment information, in recognition of the stigma associated with the disease and the need to protect patients from the possible negative consequences of disclosure. Unfortunately, these restrictive regulations can result in a patient’s physician not being fully informed about his patient’s addiction treatment history, which can undermine the effective coordination of patient care.

Despite its limitations, there is no doubt that the SUPPORT Act is a significant legislative achievement. While we should celebrate this breakthrough legislation, we must realize that it will not, by itself, carry us out of our current addiction crisis. Our work in conquering America’s opioid epidemic is far from done.

<span style="font-weight: 400">These potential – and actual – troop deployments are but a recent occurrence in a history of over a century of federal troop deployments and 200-plus years of legal precedent. The </span><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/polsciwb/brianl/docs/1807InsurrectionAct.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Insurrection Act of 1807</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was one of the first and most important US laws on this subject, and was followed some 71 years later by the </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385"><span style="font-weight: 400">Posse Comitatus Act of 1878</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which further limited executive authority to conduct military law enforcement on US soil. Each of those laws has evolved over time — consistent with the times and the popular will expressed through Congress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Insurrection Act, (codified, as amended, at </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-15"><span style="font-weight: 400">10 USC § 331–35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">) has changed from its 1807 inception many times, with most notable alterations in the mid-twentieth century. It has consistently exempted federal (and federalized troops) from legal prohibitions on employment and deployment on US soil where troops provide federal aid for state governments (</span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/331"><span style="font-weight: 400">§331</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), are militia and armed forces enforcing federal authority (</span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/332"><span style="font-weight: 400">§332</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), are dealing with interference with state and federal law (</span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/333"><span style="font-weight: 400">§333</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), where there has been a proclamation to disperse in times of civil disturbance (</span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/334"><span style="font-weight: 400">§334</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), including Guam and the US Virgin Islands (</span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/335"><span style="font-weight: 400">§335</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">). For a brief year, it was expanded under the 2007 </span><a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.109hr5122"><span style="font-weight: 400">John M. Warner Defense Authorization Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, then brought back to longstanding language in the subsequent fiscal year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The so-called Posse Comitatus Act, passed on June 18, 1878, prohibited federal troops from supervising confederate state elections in the latter portion of the Reconstruction Era. It originally applied only to the US Army, but was amended after the US Air Force was created to include those forces in 1956, then has applied by DOD regulation to include US Navy and US Marine Corps forces as well. The Posse Comitatus Act read then, and reads now, as follows:</span>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army [or the Air Force] as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</span></blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">The Posse Comitatus Act has prohibited troops under federal authority (that is </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Title 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Active Component troops and "federalized" </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32"><span style="font-weight: 400">Title 32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> National Guard troops) from generally conducting law enforcement duties on US soil absent congressionally legislated or constitutionally enumerated authority or exception. Several such federal troop use exceptions to the Insurrection Act and Posse Comitatus Act would be troop employment and deployment during a biological, radiological, or nuclear event under </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/831"><span style="font-weight: 400">18 USC §831</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or intelligence, military equipment, training, advice or facilities usage, amongst other matters, in support of civilian law enforcement under </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-18"><span style="font-weight: 400">10 USC §382</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An armed force ideal for border security, unbound by the Insurrection Act or Posse Comitatus Act, but customarily maritime in focus, is the US Coast Guard (USCG). Under </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/1"><span style="font-weight: 400">14 USC §1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, "[t]he Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times." The USCG takes on a unique naval force role, under </span><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/3"><span style="font-weight: 400">14 USC § 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, as amended by section 211 of the </span><a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.109hr889"><span style="font-weight: 400">Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, upon declaration of war or when the president directs, but as it is now under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), it acts in peacetime as a law enforcement agency that can conduct activities on US soil and in US waters.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neither the Insurrection Act of 1807 nor the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 provide for the federal government to supersede the ordinary operation of US federal, state or territorial law. Neither act has ever been used to absolutely proscribe federal troop employment and deployment during transitory crises, emergencies, and disorders. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the beginning of this month, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/us-to-deny-visas-to-unmarried-same-sex-partners-of-foreign-diplomats/">announced a new policy</a> that same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and employees of the United Nations will only be granted visas if the partners are married. The State Department immediately applied the policy and refused visas to unmarried partners.  The Department also told partners who lived in the United States on visas that they must marry by the end of the year or they will lose their visa.

The administration characterized this as bringing the visa policy in line with the Supreme Court’s 2015 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf"><em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em></a> decision. In <em>Obergefell, </em>the court held that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples violates the constitution. Since <em>Obergefell</em>, many such policies including <span>domestic partnerships, civil unions, and equitable remedies granted same-sex partners, have been rolled back.</span><span></span> The justification for these annulments was based upon the reasoning that if the equitable remedy was made available to address the harm of discriminatory marriage laws, the remedy is no longer needed since such couples may now legally marry.

Requiring same-sex couples to marry to keep receiving benefits they had previously obtained without marriage is part of a domestic trend. States, municipalities, and other entities such as individual employers have made decisions about rescinding previous policies on an individual basis. Moreover, such reversals have drawn criticism. This disapproval comes from both scholars wary of further entrenching marriage as the single foundational relationship upon which benefits are based, and from activists who point out that much of the discrimination that justified such remedies still exists.

However, setting aside the inconsistent domestic reaction, treating visas as a purely domestic issue ignores the obvious practical cruelty of the policy as imposed upon an entirely international group of people. The United Nations has almost 200 member states, and only 12% allow same-sex marriage. Thus, the vast majority of such couples cannot meet the new requirement as they are unable to marry in their home countries.

The Trump administration responded by saying that in such circumstances, case-by-case “workarounds” might be made. But in a significant number of the states that do not allow same-sex marriage, same-sex relationships are stigmatized and even criminalized. Taking any public step to formalize their relationship for purposes of a visa exposes the diplomat and his or her partner to legal sanctions and violence at home.

The new policy is characteristic of several broader Trump administration patterns. First, it is the latest in an obsessive series of reversing Democrat decisions – in this case, a 2009 policy instituted by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. There is no security need or other justification for the reversal, merely the irrelevant call to bring granting of visas to international diplomats in line with domestic U.S. family law.

Second, the policy takes advantage of marriage-focused media coverage of LGBTQ equality in recent years, thus distracting from other important equality issues. This is in some ways a natural consequence of well-supported advocacy campaigns. These campaigns arose from grassroots efforts independent from large activist organizations. Once leaders turned their attention to marriage, coordinated strategies of litigation along with media awareness campaigns turned public opinion about same-sex relationships at a stunningly quick pace. But one consequence of the increased awareness about issues relating to marriage equality is that other issues of LGBTQ equality fell out of the public’s attention.

For example, many Americans are unaware that although a same-sex couple may now legally marry, there is no federal legislation that explicitly protects that same couple from employment discrimination. Nor is there much state legislation offering protections for LGBTQ. In the same way, the Trump administration may be assuming that the average American is not aware of the global climate around LGBTQ rights. <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2017/08/08/gay-marriage-around-the-world-2013/">Less than 30 countries</a> around the globe have marriage equality. And even with marriage equality, it can still be dangerous for individuals who are open about their sexuality. Just as many Americans considered <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> a sign that the fight for LGBTQ equality had been won, many people may think the fight for marriage equality was won throughout the world rather than in a minority of nations.

Finally, the visa policy is in keeping with a disturbing trend by the Trump administration – affecting one individual’s decision to come to the United States by threatening his or her family. International diplomats stationed in the U.S. or with the United Nations who have same-sex partners now face a choice. They can either hide their same-sex relationship and live in a different country than their partner or potentially expose themselves and their partners to discrimination and violence.

The parallel is obvious to the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/07/doebbler-immigrants-no-apply/">family separation policy</a> of this past summer. Breaking up families is used as a deterrent for families seeking to immigrate to the U.S. In both cases, the safety of a loved one is used as a bargaining chip. This is merely one more way the Trump administration demonstrates disapproval of non-Americans and international law.

Despite the repugnancy of the policy, it does not seem that the change will occasion much attention or legal challenge. The executive holds a significant amount of discretion in areas relating to immigration, so any legal challenge to the policy would face particularly difficult odds. Although the visa policy signals a clear disregard for the safety and equality of LGBTQ people, it affects a relatively small number of people. So, the widespread public reaction akin to that sparked by the family separation policy seems unlikely. If allowed to proceed, however, the policy is simply one more step away from the promise of equality that most Americans hold dear.

<span>Mounting a statewide campaign for elective office is by no means an easy (or inexpensive) feat.

As a New York-licensed attorney, he had previously worked in the federal sector for over a decade, including stints as a judicial clerk, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">Department of Justice</span></span></a><span> (DOJ) prosecutor and manager, Senate liaison, and </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">Department of Health and Human Services</span></span></a><span> political appointee.</span>

<span>Perez’s workplace was primarily at agency headquarters and the Capitol in Washington, DC. Federal hiring </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/261/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">standards</span></span></a><span> for attorney positions typically specify that employees must be licensed in “at least one” US state or territory, but not necessarily in the location where their government duties take them. Under the US Constitution’s </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">Supremacy Clause</span></span></a><span>, state licensing requirements may not directly </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/373/379.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">interfere</span></span></a><span> with federal operations.</span>

<span>Perez’s AG candidacy was challenged by a local Republican politician and ultimately blocked by the state’s highest court. The Maryland </span><a href="https://courts.state.md.us/coappeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">Court of Appeals</span></span></a><span> </span><a href="https://courts.state.md.us/data/opinions/coa/2007/142a05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">ruled</span></span></a><span> that Perez was ineligible to run for AG because his federal practice as a New York-licensed attorney did not count as the practice of law in Maryland. The Court acknowledged that the </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Supremacy_Clause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">federal supremacy</span></span></a><span> doctrine, applicable </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">statute</span></span></a><span>, and federal appellate court </span><a href="https://www.federalrulesofappellateprocedure.org/title-vii/rule-46/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">rules</span></span></a><span> enable DOJ attorneys to represent US interests in any state irrespective of licensure, but declined to view this limited authorization as “tantamount to practicing law” in Maryland on a regular basis. The plurality opinion differentiated between maintaining an exclusively federal practice with an out-of-state bar license and practicing law in the state with the “carte blanche authorization” of Maryland bar membership.</span>

<span>Thus, the Court interpreted the Maryland Constitution as requiring the AG to be both a member of the state bar and an “active practitioner” in the state for 10 years. Given that Perez had been admitted to practice in Maryland for only 5 years, he could have satisfied no more than half of the decade-long practice requirement for AG.</span><b><u><span></span></u></b>

<span>The indisputable fact that Perez lacked the requisite period of Maryland bar membership allowed the judges to astutely sidestep the thorniest issue at play: namely, “what activity does or does not constitute practicing law?" Indeed, the plurality opinion in Perez’s case professed not to be concerned with the content of his legal practice, only its licensure and location. The Court specifically noted that “lawyers do not have to be litigators” and “may be regarded as practicing law [without appearing] in <i>any</i> court” [emphasis original].</span>

<span>Nonetheless, a concurring opinion in the case warned that the Court risked descending a slippery slope by bifurcating bar admission and legal practice into separate professional requirements. The concurring judges cautioned that any “qualitative judicial review” of AG candidates’ professional experience could set a dangerous precedent for deciding future elections in the courtroom rather than at the ballot box.</span>

<b><span>A Tale of 2 States: Bar Admission without Legal Practice?</span></b><span></span>

<span>This concern was borne out 4 years later and a few hundred miles to the north. The 1897 Connecticut </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_035.htm#sec_3-124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">law</span></span></a><span> establishing the AG position required that the officeholder be “an attorney at law of at least ten years’ active practice at the bar of this state.” When Susan Bysiewicz — then Connecticut </span><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/SOTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">secretary of state</span></span></a><span> and today the Democratic nominee for </span><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/ltgovernor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">lieutenant governor</span></span></a><span> — became the Democratic front-runner for AG in 2010, her qualifications were </span><a href="https://aconnecticutlawblog.com/is-susan-bysiewicz-legally-qualified-to-be-attorney-general/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">questioned</span></span></a><span> by a local attorney and blogger.</span>

<span>Like Perez, Bysiewicz was ultimately </span><a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR298/298CR105.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">disqualified</span></span></a><span> by her state’s </span><a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/supremecourt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">Supreme Court</span></span></a><span>. Unlike Perez, however, she had been admitted to the state bar for more than double the minimum duration. The issue in Bysiewicz’s case was precisely the one that the Maryland judges had been mostly able to avoid: had the candidate actually practiced law as her primary livelihood for long enough to meet the eligibility criteria?</span>

<span>Bysiewicz had spent 4 years at a Connecticut corporate law firm and 2 years as an in-house counsel in the insurance industry. After that, her professional attention turned exclusively to politics, leaving her potentially 4 years shy of the statutory 10-year mark. Bysiewicz </span><a href="http://greenbag.org/v14n4/v14n4_articles_kels.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">countered</span></span></a><span>  this challenge with 2 arguments.</span>

<span>First, she claimed that bar admission and legal practice were synonymous. Unfortunately, this contention shoehorned her into maintaining that a licensed attorney who went “fishing every day for ten years” was nonetheless practicing law. It also echoed a concern voiced by one of the judges in the Maryland case, who worried that requiring nothing but bar membership effectively meant that a candidate who had never done “anything that could conceivably, under any definition, constitute the practice of law” could be elected the chief legal officer of the state.</span>

<span>When this argument failed, Bysiewicz offered a more nuanced position. She claimed that because she was an attorney, her service as Connecticut secretary of state constituted the practice of law when she applied legal judgment and skills to the job. Since the secretary of state need </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_033.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">not</span></span></a><span> be (and often is not) a lawyer, Bysiewicz’s argument presumed that a role not considered to be the unauthorized practice of law when assumed by a layperson could simultaneously count as legal practice when occupied by a licensed attorney. It did not help in this regard that while serving as secretary, Bysiewicz had </span><a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/webforms/forms/gc022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">certified</span></span></a><span> on several occasions with the state judicial branch that she was not in fact practicing law in order to secure a discount on her annual fee.</span>

<span>More importantly, though, the flaw in Bysiewicz’s second argument was its failure to differentiate between a constituent and a client. Her legal training and acumen were no doubt useful in executing the duties of secretary of state — which include implementing state election law — but the secretary’s obligations and authorities emanate from the statutory position, not a confidential and fiduciary relationship with either an individual or organizational client.</span>

<span>In ruling Bysiewicz ineligible, however, the Court went a giant step further. In stark contrast with the Maryland judges, the Connecticut justices found that the AG requirements limited eligibility to “an attorney with at least some experience litigating cases in court” and “some measure of experience in trying cases.” Since the facts established that Bysiewicz had no litigation experience whatsoever, the Court did not go on specify how much courtroom work would be deemed sufficient.</span>

<span>In a </span><a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR298/298CR105A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">concurring opinion</span></span></a><span>, two of the justices perceived the danger ahead. By “address[ing] an issue it need not,” the majority had invited a potential morass of eligibility challenges in future elections, to the detriment of AG candidates with exclusively transactional practices and backgrounds. Having already concluded that Bysiewicz</span><span style="font-family: Calibri"><span> </span></span><span>fell short of 10 years’ experience representing clients, the Court had nonetheless waded into a contentious debate over courtroom experience.</span>

<b><span>The Presumption of Eligibility and the Meaning of Practice</span></b><span></span>

<span>When the experiential requirements for AG candidates are based solely on the </span><a href="http://www.senate.ga.gov/Documents/gaconstitution.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">length</span></span></a><span>  of state bar admission, the issue is straightforward and resolvable with the search of a database. When the prerequisites are framed in terms of legal practice, ambiguity and litigation may ensue. In such cases, courts must balance a reasonable interpretation of the constitutional or statutory provision with the typical </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-supreme-court/1785494.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">presumption</span></span></a><span> in favor of a candidate’s eligibility for elective office. It is not necessarily incumbent upon courts to throw up their hands in helplessness and decide that the “practice of law” is so indeterminate that bar admission is the only barometer. After all, when lawmakers want to make bar admission the sole qualification for AG candidacy, there is a plethora of evidence that they know how to do so explicitly.</span>

<span>However, courts must also remain cognizant that the nature of politics is such that their rulings are apt to be weaponized by candidates seeking to portray their opponents as unqualified or unfit for office. Predictably, this is what happened in Connecticut right after the 2010 Bysiewicz decision, where the eventual Democratic nominee (and </span><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/AG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">current AG</span></span></a><span>) George Jepsen was immediately faced with eligibility questions based on his self-description as a corporate transactions attorney rather than a hardened litigator.</span>

<span>Now that Jepsen is </span><span><a href="https://portal.ct.gov/AG/Press-Releases/2017-Press-Releases/Statement-from-AG-Jepsen-on-2018-Race-for-Connecticut-Attorney-General" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #0000ff">retiring</span></a> after 2 terms, this year’s Connecticut AG race has prominently featured mutual accusations of ineligibility, both during the </span><a href="https://www.law.com/ctlawtribune/2018/08/08/democratic-candidates-for-connecticut-ag-clash-on-issues-qualifications-during-final-debate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">primaries</span></span></a><span> and in the </span><a href="https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/Hatfield-Attacks-Tong-Over-Attorney-General-Qualifications-491536041.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">general election</span></span></a><span>.

Indeed, the attorney-blogger who initiated the challenge to Bysiewicz’s candidacy 8 years ago has turned the </span><a href="https://www.wtnh.com/news/politics/questions-raised-about-qualifications-for-candidate-running-for-attorney-general/1294468483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">issue</span></span></a><span> into something of a quadrennial cottage industry. In the AG context at least, litigation experience (or lack thereof) has become Connecticut’s version of the proverbial “3 a.m. phone call” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/national/hillary-clintons-2008-3-am-phone-call-ad/2016/09/30/a1043ef6-8729-11e6-b57d-dd49277af02f_video.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c72c9dae69a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><span style="color: #0000ff">attack ad</span></span></a><span> in presidential contests.</span>

<span>While final clarity on the meaning of qualifications for public office is perhaps best obtained through state legislative action or constitutional amendment, courts will likely continue to find themselves in the middle of AG election spats unless and until that happens. Given that the prerogative of voters to select their own leaders in democratic elections is ultimately at stake, courts would do well to confine their decisions and opinions to the narrow issues at hand. In Maryland, Perez could have been disqualified on the simple basis of bar admission without delving into the intricacies of federal versus state practice. In Connecticut, Bysiewicz could have been deemed ineligible by virtue of not having represented clients for the requisite 10 years without jumping headlong into the quicksand of privileging some types of legal practice over others.</span>

<span>Might it be preferable from a public policy perspective for the chief legal billet in all US states and territories to be occupied by esteemed legal practitioners with a vast array of experience, including complex criminal and civil litigation? Of course. But elections ensure that we get the government we deserve, whatever courts may think of voters’ choices.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The New York Times ran a front-page story on October 21, 2018 with the headline: <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html">“‘Transgender’ Could be Defined out of Existence under Trump Administration.”</a></span> The story reported that “the Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth.” Other than <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/caitlyn-jenner-i-thought-trump-would-help-the-lgbtq-community-i-was-wrong/2018/10/25/3c4cd61e-d86a-11e8-83a2-d1c3da28d6b6_story.html?utm_term=.0e9be03c91a7">Caitlyn Jenner</a></span>, who had maintained a naïve belief that Trump would honor his pledge at the Republican National Convention to <span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-reaches-out-to-lgbt-community-in-rnc-2016-speech">“do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology</a></span>,” no one was surprised.

This new draft policy wasn’t really “news.”

Within a month of taking office, Attorney General Sessions withdrew the <span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-jeff-sessions-withdrawal-title-ix-guidance">“Dear Colleague” letter</a></span> that would have supported transgender students in using the bathroom that conformed to their gender identity.  Emboldened by the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) position, <span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/17-3113/17-3113-2018-06-18.html">some plaintiffs tried to sue school districts</a></span> to force them to require transgender students to use single-user stalls and keep them out of bathrooms that conformed to their gender identity. Citing a similar result in a <span><a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2017/D05-30/C:16-3522:J:Williams:aut:T:fnOp:N:1971382:S:0">Seventh Circuit case</a></span>, the Third Circuit rejected those efforts: “A school district’s policy that required a transgender student to use single-user facilities ‘actually invited more scrutiny and attention from his peers.’ Adopting the appellants’ position would very publicly brand all transgender students with a scarlet “T,” and they should not have to endure that as the price of attending their public school.”

Then, the President issued various directives to discharge all transgender individuals from the military, and not allow any new ones to enlist. On July 26, 2017, President Trump used his <span><a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/890193981585444864?lang=en">Twitter acc</a>ount</span> to announce that "the United States government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military." On August 25, 2017, Trump released a <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-secretary-homeland-security/">memorandum</a></span> directing the Defense Department to develop a plan to discharge transgender members of the military and ban all new transgender recruits within the next six months.  In October 2017, a federal judge <span><a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163525/10-30-17-Doe-v-Trump-Opinion.pdf">blocked</a></span> the implementation of that ban finding it was based on “disapproval of transgender people generally.” This tactic was especially cruel because the Obama administration had <span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-military-ban-lifted-obama-cements-historic-lgbt-rights-legacy-n600541">promised</a></span> them that they could serve openly. They would now face termination for following a previous policy. On March 23, 2018, in response to the obvious due process problems with the previous memorandum for active service members, the Trump administration <span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-secretary-homeland-security-regarding-military-service-transgender-individuals/">announced</a></span> it would begin implementing its transgender policy but would allow the Defense Secretary to retain service members who had been serving openly under President Obama’s prior directive. A federal district court judge quickly issued an <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html?module=inline">injunction</a>,</span> stating that the new policy was discriminatory and unjustified. <span><a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/10/lawyers_for_president_trump_se.html">Every federal court</a></span> that has heard a case on this issue ruled that the ban should be enjoined because of its unconstitutionality. This means that the courts have seen through a sham, post-hoc attempt to justify a policy that clearly flowed from Trump’s July 2017 tweet. Nonetheless, <span><a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20180718_karnoski-stay-decision">continuing litigation</a></span> creates much anxiety and hardship for transgender members of the military. Despite these court decisions, transgender recruits also <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/military-transgender-recruits.html">report</a></span> they are still not able to enlist in the military.

Meanwhile, the DOJ has consistently taken positions adverse to the transgender community under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).  When a federal district court judge, on March 1, 2017, overturned a regulation drafted by the Obama administration to protect transgender individuals from health care discrimination, the Trump administration took the highly unusual step of deciding <span><a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/03/02/doj-lets-court-order-stand-trans-health-care/">not to appeal</a></span> that decision, allowing a nationwide injunction to go into effect.

Not deterred by the lack of protection offered by that regulation, litigants went forward with challenging transgender discrimination in health care under the ACA. Courts in <span><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2018/07/26/judge-orders-state-cover-transgender-surgery-medicaid-recipients/838448002/">Wisconsin</a></span> and <span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56608e8ce4b022d97d9958ea/t/5ba4013fa4222f88f1b2e0a8/1537474880181/ECF+96+-+Memorandum+Opinion+and+Order.pdf">Minnesota</a></span> concluded that the plain language of the ACA prevented transgender discrimination.  The Trump administration has nonetheless <span><a href="https://transequality.org/HCRL-FAQ">refused</a></span> to protect transgender people seeking care under the ACA.

The DOJ’s hostility to transgender people was also reflected in the positions they took under Title VII, which are in conflict with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s position. After the EEOC successfully brought a transgender discrimination case in the <span><a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0045p-06.pdf">Sixth Circuit</a></span> to challenge a woman’s termination from a funeral home, the <span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-107/67913/20181024152750333_18-107%20RG%20GR%20Harris%20Funeral%20Homes.pdf">Trump Administration</a></span> sought to have that decision reversed in the United States Supreme Court.

One story reflects the horrific consequences from this kind of overt discrimination. Fourteen-year old <span><a href="https://medium.com/transequalitynow/tragic-health-care-discrimination-case-sheds-light-on-the-future-of-anti-discrimination-measures-e6ae3b2fa385">Kyler Prescott</a></span> was accessing health care at an in-patient mental health facility under his Affordable Care Act health plan. The mental health facility insisted on calling him by female pronouns, deliberately worsening his mental health condition. After he committed suicide, his mother <span><a href="https://www.ebglaw.com/content/uploads/2017/10/Prescott-v.-Rady-Children_s-Hospital-San-Diego_-2017-U.S.-Dist.-LEXIS-160259.pdf">successfully</a></span> brought an action under ACA arguing that he was discriminated against on the basis of “sex,” relying on the plain language of the ACA. The district court judge agreed with her argument and allowed the case to go forward. The Trump Administration would insist that we should tolerate such disrespectful and inhumane treatment.

If the Trump administration’s proposal to create a uniform, narrow definition of “sex” and “sex discrimination” across all federal agencies becomes policy, it could create many more hardships for the transgender community.  Here are some of the potential nightmares:
<ul>
 	<li>Soldiers who have transitioned to a different gender from their birth gender would be required to dress and live as their birth gender while serving in the military undermining <span><a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/04/25/service-chiefs-no-unit-cohesion-problems-trans-military-service/">unit cohesion</a></span>.</li>
 	<li>Patients who have been prescribed hormone treatment or surgery to assist them in transitioning would not be able to access that treatment under the Affordable Care Act, causing <span><a href="https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/healthcare">adverse health effects</a></span> and increasing mental health problems.</li>
 	<li>Students who attend publicly-funded schools would be addressed exclusively by their birth name and birth gender even if they have transitioned to a different sex, increasing <span><a href="https://transequality.org/issues/youth-students">bullying</a></span> and harming the mental health of these students.</li>
 	<li><span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/12/610692321/the-guidelines-for-protection-of-transgender-prisoners-just-got-rewritten">Prisoners</a></span> who have transitioned to a different gender would be housed with their birth gender putting them at increased risk of rape and harassment. A <span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4459297-BOP-Change-Order-Transgender-Offender-Manual-5.html">May 11, 2018 Memorandum</a></span> reverses protections for transgender prisoners.</li>
 	<li>The <span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/29/521921287/u-s-census-to-leave-sexual-orientation-gender-identity-questions-off-new-surveys">United States Census</a></span> Bureau would keep data that is inconsistent with the gender that a person experiences and lives providing inaccurate information about the society in which we live.</li>
 	<li>A <span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/transgender-passport-rules-haven-t-changed-advocates-confirm-amid-concerns-n897361">U.S. Passport</a></span> would have a different gender designation than a state-issued driver’s license or birth certificate causing enormous confusion when people try to travel internationally. Under <span><a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/apply-renew-passport/change-of-sex-marker.html">Obama-era policy</a></span>, passports are supposed to reflect an individual’s gender identity.</li>
 	<li>No federal employee who has transitioned to a new gender would be allowed to wear gender-conforming clothing and use gender-conforming labels at work, increasing rates of suspension and discharge, as well as harassment for transgender people.</li>
 	<li>Transgender people who are homeless would receive no federal assistance through HUD in securing a safe place to stay. Safe practices rules that had been developed under the Obama administration would be abandoned despite the <span><a href="https://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness">high rates</a></span> of homelessness for transgender youth.</li>
 	<li>Police departments would receive no oversight for their treatment of transgender people, despite evidence of <span><a href="http://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports">longstanding abusive practices</a></span> against this community. These pervasive problems make transgender people afraid to seek help from law enforcement when they are the victims of criminal acts.</li>
</ul>
The <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178031/">suicide rate</a></span> for the transgender community is already higher than for many other communities. We live in a time when there is increased attention to mental health problems. Why would the federal government want to act with such cruelty to transgender people?

A respectful governmental policy towards transgender people will not require anyone to change their own gender identity. It will just require them to respect the choices made by others.

If the marriage equality debate taught us anything, it’s that a person’s marital status should not <span><a href="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/article/what-happens-when-a-married-same-sex-couple-moves-to-a-state-without-same-sex-marriage-cb.rl">change</a></span> depending on what state they reside in or whether they are seeking federal rather than state benefits. But, if the Trump administration proposed policy were allowed to go into effect, that would become the new nightmare for the transgender community.  A person might wake up identifying as a male person in Massachusetts but then travel to a military base for work where the person might be forced to present as a female. Bullying, harassment, and even suicide rates would go up in stark contradiction to Trump’s <span><a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/22/16905658/trump-lgbtq-anniversary">campaign pledge</a></span> “to do everything in my power to protect the LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.” It would not be a “foreign” ideology, it would be a home-grown one.

Fortunately, the Trump administration policy is so extreme that it is unlikely to withstand legal challenge. As detailed above, they have already lost cases involving the military, the Affordable Care Act, Title VII and Title IX. In recent years, <span><a href="https://transequality.org/federal-case-law-on-transgender-people-and-discrimination">every circuit court</a></span> that has interpreted the term “sex” has recognized that discrimination on the basis of one’s gender identity is a core type of sex discrimination. But these issues have not yet reached the United States Supreme Court. Rather than rely on the Gorsuch/Kavanaugh Court to put politics aside to invalidate the Trump administration’s hostility to the transgender community, it would be better if this draft policy simply went into the shredder.

It may not be new, but it is dangerous.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>T</strong>he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/25/politics/trump-blames-media-for-anger-after-attacks/index.html">blaming of attempted bombings</a> of prominent democratic leaders and opponents of President Trump on a vindictive press by him at a public rally casts a dark shadow over a bleak landscape where once the freedom of the press was a corner stone of our democracy.  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/29/trump-slams-media-as-true-enemy-of-the-people-days-after-cnn-targeted.html">Declaring</a> the press in the United States an “enemy of the people” rings reminiscent of attacks on the press in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-president-trumps-phrase-an-enemy-of-the-people-2017-2">Germany of the 1930’s</a>.

Around the world, strongmen have been attacking the concept of freedom of the press, as well as members of the press themselves. <a href="https://rsf.org/en/news/russia-vladimir-putins-damning-record-press-freedom">Putin</a> has blatantly singled out members of the Russian press critical of his policies and shot them, poisoned them, run them over, and even thrown them off buildings.

Recently the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45935823">direction</a> by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), to kill Washington Post reporter and commentator Jamal Khashoggi is a further attack on members of the media who criticize a strongman. The crisis that followed quickly drew in three men, all arrogant and disdainful of the law, hypocritically mouthing words they did not believe in order to quell the outrage, to support each other, or to gain political advantage. Those men are MBS, Erdogan, and Trump.

Though dictators throughout history attack and then silence a critical press, the 21<sup>st</sup> century has seen the rise of the strongman, particularly in the past few years and with it more direct and violent attempts to muzzle the media. With a surprising rapidity, the stepping forward of nationalistic politicians onto the world stage where they used to dwell on the fringes of society, mainly in the political shadows, has caught liberal democracies off guard. Such thinking seemed to be behind us, not any longer.

The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi is indicative of this new inward thinking nationalism and it’s hatred of the press not seen since the late 1920’s and early 1930’s. Using terms such as fake news as a shield; the likes of Trump, Putin, Li, Erdogan, Duterte, MBS, among other strongmen, have begun to move societies against the media. With chants led by the President of the United States, “CNN Sucks!” augers poorly for American society and the world as a whole.

The loss of moral leadership by the United States under Donald Trump has enabled the increased pressure and attacks on a critical press. These various strongmen feel that being held accountable is no longer a viable threat to their political position at home or abroad. Essentially the rule of law, so essential to the maintenance of international peace and security, is no longer a deterrent.

The American President is pushing away legal, diplomatic, and political norms that have been cornerstones to that peace and security since 1945. The threat of pulling out of key geopolitical organizations and treaties such as the <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/13/trump-takes-aim-at-world-bank-over-china-loans/">World Bank</a>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/donald-trump-threatens-to-pull-us-out-of-wto-if-it-doesnt-shape-up/articleshow/65616403.cms">World Trade Organization</a>, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/donald-trump-us-arms-agreement-russia/index.html">INF treaty</a>, even <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2018/07/12/trump-meets-with-afghanistan-war-partners-277146">NATO</a>, have turned the early 21<sup>st</sup> century into a kaleidoscopic world where nothing matters and old friendships and allies are declared threats. We tend to forget Trump calling Canada, <em>Canada</em>, a national security threat.

Declaring oneself a nationalist in a global economy and international community sounds like a certain German chancellor in the 1930’s who founded and came to power with a nationalist political party. That chancellor did two things very quickly on seizing power, go after a vulnerable minority blaming them for the nation’s problems and attacking and muzzling the German press. Dictators do this as a matter of course. Stalin, Mussolini and Mao Tse Tung used the same tactics.

The citizenry of both Germany and the United States at first used the law to try to reign in this tsunami of hate, fear, and lawlessness, but to no avail. Politicians viewing this nightmare saw personal advantage and joined this surge of nationalism putting party over country. The Germans did this in the early to mid-1930’s and the Americans starting in the 2010’s.

The governing party then and now essentially looked at the political landscape and thought either you are with us, the party, or you are against us. The checks and balances under a constitutional framework went ignored for political power. The opposition at first resisted but had no answer. They were left shouting into the wind warning of a darker America.

A free and unrestricted press is the bulwark against such tactics. That is why strongmen quickly try to restrain and then silence all types of media, shaping it in a way that allows them to control and manipulate its citizens for their political and even personal advantage.

The genie of lawlessness may have now slid out of the bottle, never to be put back. The removal of all that a nation has stood for, particularly a free press, is starting to be removed one brick at a time: respect, kindness, moral courage, character, decency, and respect of the law and it’s institutions to include the media, both in Germany in the 1930’s and the United States today it is not a pretty picture.

The people of the United States know and see what is happening, yet they are still in a state of denial. Is it too late to step forward and stop this slide into the dark corners of anarchy? Not yet, but history shows us that time is of the essence. The power of the vote remains intact for now. If we do not use our right to vote, the man with no character, no respect for the law, and who mocks our traditions of moral courage will assuredly change our country in an unimaginable way.

As a republic, we need to hold the Constitution close and ensure our elected officials always turn to and use that Constitution as their guide. Our Founding Fathers always contemplated the push and pull of competing interests and desires in governing our Republic. I do not think our Founders ever contemplated this. Yet the Constitution remains the great gyroscope that keeps the Republic balanced under the law despite that ebb and flow of political and social strife.

Remember the loss of a free press in history and remember most of all the loss of the truth. As Joseph Goebbels stated in Nazi Germany, if you tell them lies long enough, they will start to believe them. We are not there yet, but possibly moving in that direction. Recall what Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/19/giuliani-truth-todd-trump-788161">said</a> recently, someone who once respected the law and the United States, “the truth is not the truth.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The latest rumblings of the current administration inform us of President Trump’s plan to completely ignore the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> of the U.S. Constitution, and instead sign an executive order that would remove the right to citizenship for children born in the United States to non-U.S. citizens. Specifically, the Amendment reads as follows:
<blockquote>“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”</blockquote>
This is not the first time the words of the Fourteenth Amendment have become part of the public discourse. Members of Congress have attempted to limit the rights of immigrants by advocating the denial of birthright citizenship to those born to undocumented parents in the United States. But under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, all persons born or naturalized in the United States who are also “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” are citizens of the United States.

Much of the current debate turns on the meaning and intention of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” The argument put forth is that undocumented immigrants are not under the jurisdiction of the United States, and so the children of undocumented immigrants also do not fall within that jurisdiction. Therefore, such children although born in the United States, should not be American citizens.

The argument is flawed when scrutinized in context. Upon its passage, the Fourteenth Amendment effectively reversed the decision in the famous case of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393">Scott v. Stanford</a>. Scott was an enslaved African American who unsuccessfully sued in federal court for his freedom. The Supreme Court held that neither slaves nor free descendants of slaves were citizens. Consequently, Congress enacted the Fourteenth Amendment to specifically enable African-Americans born in the United States to obtain citizenship at birth.

It is worth mentioning that the author of the Citizenship Clause confirmed in his original debates that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” was specifically designed to exclude only foreigners who belonged to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers, and Native Americans who maintained their tribal ties. This was confirmed in a number of cases including <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/169/649">United States v. Wong Kim Ark,</a> which involved a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were statutorily ineligible for naturalization because of their race.  The Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco, was in fact entitled to birthright citizenship, stating that the term “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” excluded two classes of people other than Native Americans: children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomats of a foreign state.  The phrase was never intended to exclude anyone else.  (Incidentally, Congress subsequently passed the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/global-pages/larger-image.html?i=/historical-docs/doc-content/images/indian-citizenship-act-1924-l.jpg&amp;c=/historical-docs/doc-content/images/indian-citizenship-act-1924.caption.html">Indian Citizenship act of 1924</a>, which granted full U.S. citizenship to Native Americans.)

Opponents of birthright citizenship argue that because undocumented parents still owe their allegiance to a foreign country, their children born in the United States do not owe complete allegiance to the United States, and consequently should be denied citizenship. But it is important to remember that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment make no reference whatsoever to allegiance. This is because allegiance is loyalty to the place of one’s birth, and not to the citizenship of one’s parents.

So while there are some who believe the Fourteenth Amendment should exclude those born in the United States to undocumented parents, history suggests otherwise. The history behind the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not seem to be making its way into the public dialogue. Instead there is a movement underway to reshape the Constitution from a document historically interpreted to grant rights to those living in the United States, to one that limits and even denies those rights. The call is to redefine the Fourteenth Amendment to exclude citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are undocumented, or in temporary lawful status.

A popular explanation for this movement is that <span>immigrants who enter the country illegally</span> specifically come to the United States to give birth, to gain citizenship for their children and thus obtain legal status themselves. Misinformed proponents of this theory callously refer to such children as “anchor babies.” The reality however, is that most undocumented people come to the United States for safety and/or economic reasons, and “anchor babies” are simply not part of the immigration trend. Under current law, U.S. citizens must wait until they are at least 21 years of age to petition for permanent residence for their parents. Simply because a child is born in the United States does not mean that the parents are allowed to stay permanently. To the contrary, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly INS) is not reputed to be an agency designed to keep families together.

Equally misinformed is the argument that deporting “anchor babies” would decrease overall illegal immigration. In <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/research/demographic-impacts-repealing-birthright-citizenship">The Demographic Impacts of Repealing Birthright Citizenship</a>, the Migration Policy Institute estimates that denial of U.S. citizenship to children born to unauthorized immigrants would actually increase the unauthorized population from its current 10.8 million to 16 million by 2050. Amending the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution to prevent birthright citizenship would only escalate the very problem it is intended to resolve.

All three branches of our federal government have confirmed birthright citizenship. To eliminate this right would be unconstitutional and impractical. The law has not changed since United States v. Wong Kim Ark, and neither has the Fourteenth Amendment. What has changed is the escalating and complex problems of illegal immigration, and public opinion toward undocumented immigrants. While it is true that our country has an immigration problem, that problem is not with undocumented immigrants, but rather with a broken system in need of significant reform. While we may disagree over our country’s immigration policies, we must agree that the way we respond to those policies cannot include tampering with the Fourteenth Amendment. Doing so would show a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Constitution – provisions designed to expand civil rights, not limit them – and would violate over one hundred years of legal progress by undermining the civil victories of our past.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While transgender people have existed since the dawn of time, the last decade has seen an increasing spotlight on the community and transgender people’s right to recognition and protection.<span> </span>While this has taken on many different angles, federal and state administrations have come under scrutiny in the last few weeks for choices to exclude transgender people from everyday protections.<span> </span>In Kansas, a <a href="https://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/legal-docs/downloads/foster_ks_20181015_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> was recently filed against the state actors who enforce policies that do not allow transgender people to amend their birth certificates to recognize their gender identity.<span> </span>At the federal level, a leaked memo obtained by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html">New York Times</a> showed that the Department of Health and Human Services is working to redefine nondiscrimination provisions based on sex under Title IX to exclude transgender people.<span>  </span>

What do these government choices mean in real life?

In Kansas, the choice not to allow transgender people to update their birth certificates means that any time a transgender person has to use their birth certificate, their transgender identity will be forcibly disclosed without their consent.<span> </span>So, for example, when enrolling in school, applying for or accepting a job offer, or simply trying to get other identity documents, the sex designated on a person’s birth certificate will not match their gender identity.<span> </span>This disclosure matters, because sadly, discrimination and harassment against transgender people is still extremely common across the world, including in the United States, and even in Kansas.<span> </span>According to the <a href="https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf"><span>US Transgender Survey</span></a><span></span>, a 2015 survey of over 27,000 transgender people, among those who had shown an ID with a name or gender that did not match their gender presentation, 25% reported being verbally harassed, 16% were denied services or benefits, 9% were asked to leave a<span>  </span>location or establishment, and 2% were assaulted or attacked.<span> </span>Among those who had ever held a job, one in six (16%) reported having lost at least one job because of their gender identity or expression.<span> </span>Therefore the choice of when, how, and to whom to disclose one’s gender identity is extremely sensitive and laden with risks.<span>  </span>

At the Federal level, the memo, if it were to be enforced, would play out in the context of nondiscrimination laws.<span> </span>Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in education.<span> </span>“Sex” in this context has been interpreted by courts and the Obama Administration to include gender identity, thus prohibiting discrimination in education based on a person’s transgender status.<span> </span>In the past, this included guidance that has since been rescinded that would have required transgender students to be treated in accordance with their gender identity in all sex-segregated school spaces and activities.<span> </span>If these new proposed guidelines from the memo are codified, they would legally re-define sex as what was listed on a person’s original birth certificate, which could not be changed unless rebutted by “reliable genetic evidence.”<span> </span>This would mean that all transgender students would be treated in conflict with their gender identities, and it is unclear how such a rule would be applied to intersex students.<span> </span>While the DeVos Department of Education has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/?utm_term=.c1b37a9a2c74">indicated</a> that it still intends to protect transgender students from bullying and harassment, it is hard to know how that would be carried out if the students are not even able to be recognized as transgender under the new law. Whether or not this memo comes to fruition, it signals the federal government’s animus towards transgender students in its consideration of regulation that would erase their recognition or protections completely from the law.<span>  </span>

Additionally, the memo appears to have been issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).<span> </span>If a similar definition of sex were applied to nondiscrimination laws that are enforced by HHS, that could also have serious consequences for the transgender community.<span> </span>For example, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/18/2016-11458/nondiscrimination-in-health-programs-and-activities?utm_campaign=subscription+mailing+list&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov">Section 1557</a> of the Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination in federally funded healthcare, health programs, and insurance companies, including on the basis of gender identity.<span> </span>At the end of 2016, a federal judge temporarily enjoined the enforcement of that nondiscrimination provision with respect to gender identity in <a href="https://www.crowell.com/files/20131231-Franciscan-Alliance-v-Burwell.pdf"><em>Franciscan Alliance v. Burwell</em></a>.<span> </span>However, it is unclear whether that ruling will stay in place and how broadly it would be applied.<span> </span>In the event that HHS chooses to define sex according to the memo, it could choose to go beyond not requiring the provision of (or health insurance coverage of) gender confirming medical care.<span> </span>In theory, such a definition would insulate healthcare providers who refuse to give any medical care of any kind to transgender people, regardless of its relation to their gender identity.<span>  </span>

How Did We Get Here?

So, how did these state and federal policies come about?<span> </span>In the United States, 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico all allow people to amend their birth certificates to match their gender identities. Kansas, Ohio and Tennessee are the only holdouts.<span> </span>In Kansas, courts and administrators point to a 2002 Kansas Supreme Court decision to justify their actions today.<span> </span>In <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/In_Re_Gardiner_Kansas_2002.pdf"><em>Estate of Gardiner</em></a>, the court reviewed the validity of a marriage between a cisgender man and a transgender woman. The husband had passed away, and his estranged son challenged the validity of the marriage in order to invalidate the wife’s inheritance rights.<span> </span>At the time, same-sex marriage was illegal in Kansas.<span> </span>The wife in this case had undergone social and medical transition and even had changed her out-of-state birth certificate. Nevertheless, the court ruled she was still “male” when interpreting her sex, and therefore, the marriage was invalid.<span> </span>Essentially, the court held that without legislative instruction otherwise, sex was immutable and could not be changed.<span> </span>Sixteen years later, despite a revolution in the way that the world sees and recognizes transgender people, Kansas still relies upon that reasoning to continue to refuse requests to update birth certificate sex markers for transgender people.<span> </span>To date, Kansas excludes any consideration of gender identity for the purposes of determining sex on a birth certificate.<span>  </span>

At the federal level, on the other hand, the development of the recognition of gender identity as an inextricable part of “sex” for the purposes of nondiscrimination laws has been developing for decades.<span> </span>In 1989, the US Supreme Court held in <em><a href="http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep490/usrep490228/usrep490228.pdf">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins</a> </em>that a masculine woman could not be fired for not being feminine enough.<span> </span>The court held that this kind of sex stereotyping was still an employment decision made on the basis of sex, and was therefore prohibited by Title VII’s prohibitions on sex discrimination.<span> </span>This decision opened the door for cases that defined sex nondiscrimination laws to include transgender people, who were, by definition, not acting in ways that conformed to their sex assigned at birth.<span> </span>In 2012, in <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120120821%20Macy%20v%20DOJ%20ATF.txt"><em>Macy v. Holder</em></a>, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held that employment discrimination against a transgender person based on their gender identity was prohibited by sex discrimination prohibitions under Title VII.<span> </span>Similarly, this year, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling in a similar case that is now seeking certiorari before the Supreme Court, <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0045p-06.pdf"><em>EEOC v. Harris Funeral Homes</em></a>.<span> </span>In the educational context, the Seventh Circuit held in <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2017/D05-30/C:16-3522:J:Williams:aut:T:fnOp:N:1971382:S:0"><em>Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District </em></a>that discrimination against a transgender student constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX.<span> </span>While a few federal courts have held that sex discrimination prohibitions do not include gender identity, they are in the minority.<span> </span>Up until 2016, federal courts appeared to be moving towards a strong majority that sex discrimination prohibitions included gender identity, and as such, federal agencies, including the Department of Education, began issuing guidance in line with those decisions.<span>  </span>However, after the 2016 election, such guidances were systematically revoked, and the attorney general’s office has reversed course in no longer pursuing cases to protect or defend the rights of LGBT people.<span>  </span>

What Happens Now?

The fights over transgender rights continue.<span> </span>Transgender advocates in Kansas will seek to change the birth certificate policy.<span> </span>Transgender advocates across the United States will push to hold the line and prevent the leaked memo from being anything more than a passing threat.<span> </span>And on November 6<sup>th</sup>, anyone who cares will vote.<span> </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em> This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land....</em>

Article VI, <em>US Constitution </em>(The Supremacy Clause)

As revealed yet again with his proposed abrogation of the INF Treaty, Mr. Trump is dangerously unprepared for dealing with critically urgent strategic matters. Although we are now expected to believe that alleged Russian noncompliance concerning intermediate nuclear forces has somehow made it cost-effective for the US to summarily withdraw from a binding legal agreement, there is no evident logic to this argument. Indeed, to the extent that US abrogation would plausibly encourage further nuclear spread in other parts of the world, Mr. Trump's latest seat-of-the pants policy prescription could backfire even more catastrophically than if it concerned "only" Russia.

There are corresponding jurisprudential issues here as well. <em>Ipso facto</em>, treaties entered into by the United States represent the "supreme law of the land." This core codification at Article 6 of the <em>US Constitution</em> is authoritatively known as the "Supremacy Clause," and prohibits a US president from unilaterally abrogating such law according to his own particular whims of the moment or to some entirely personal caprice. Although Mr. Trump still seems wholly unaware of the fact (an unawareness shared by his ritualistically chanting "rally" audiences), the US chief executive is not the only Constitutionally established branch of government.

Moreover, lest we forget, we still have a president, not a king.

A key question must now be raised again: can this particular president be expected to cope capably and honestly with pertinent and complex overlapping challenges of nuclear strategy and international law?

To reply, Mr. Trump's analytic and jurisprudential debilities continue to be reasonably concerning. Such understandable apprehension becomes still more noteworthy when this President's relevant shortcomings are: (1) considered as intersecting and reinforcing; (2) considered together with Mr. Trump's persistent and willing subservience to the Russian president in the midst of "Cold War II”; and (3) assessed within the formal statutory and Constitutional parameters of US nuclear command authority.

In essence, some of the cumulative security risks America faces under its current president are potentially immediate and prospectively existential. More precisely, the principal risks to US and allied security are distressingly tangible and multi-sided. These risks could become especially high during any upcoming instances of competitive risk-taking with Vladimir Putin. These are instances when each side would be seeking some sort of necessary “escalation dominance."

For such risks to generate an all-out war, including possibly even a nuclear war, is not difficult to imagine. After all, we live at a moment in history when certain seemingly minuscule escalatory misjudgments in Washington and/or Moscow could create sudden, staggering and potentially irreversible harms around the globe. To suitably "moderate" this perilous moment, Mr. Trump should first understand that world politics (1) are never properly analogous to the far narrower worlds of casino development or commercial real estate; and that authentic national security (2) can never be convincingly enhanced or rendered lawful by more-or-less artful deal making.

Going forward, President Trump must make himself much better informed about all potentially foreseeable nuclear conflict scenarios in our already anarchic or "Hobbesian" world political system. Correspondingly, both Congress and the general citizenry must keep a much closer and more diligently focused watch on Mr. Trump's problematic willingness to take nuclear war with sufficient analytic seriousness. Among other things, he will need to be reminded that literally no scientifically accurate estimates of nuclear war probability are logically possible. This is because, in science, true probabilities must always be based upon a determinable frequency of pertinent past events; there has never been a nuclear war event.

Never.

The American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 "don't count" as examples of nuclear war. Instead, these were singular episodes of nuclear attack launched upon enemy civilian populations in an otherwise conventional war. Accordingly, in any still-upcoming nuclear crisis situations, a casually dismissive presidential stance on expected outcomes could produce unexpected and/or intolerable results.

Quickly.

I have been studying nuclear warfare issues for fifty years. After four years at Princeton in the 1960s, long an intellectual center of American nuclear history and thought (recall Einstein and Oppenheimer), I first began to think about adding a modest personal contribution to the growing literature of first-generation nuclear thinkers. Already by the mid- 1970s, I was busily preparing a new manuscript on U.S. nuclear strategy and on certain corollary risks of nuclear war.

At that time, moreover, I was interested in very specific questions of presidential authority to order the use of American nuclear weapons.

Among other things, I soon learned that reliable safeguards had been carefully built into all American nuclear command/control decisions, but also that these reassuring safeguards could never apply at the critical presidential level. To a young strategic scholar, this ironic disjunction didn't make any obvious sense, especially in a world where national leadership irrationality was hardly without precedent. For needed clarifications, I reached out to retired General Maxwell D. Taylor, a distinguished former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In predictably rapid response to my query, General Taylor sent me a detailed handwritten reply. Dated 14 March 1976, the General's informed letter concluded presciently:<em> "As to those dangers arising from an irrational American president, the only protection is not to elect one."</em>

Until now, I had never really given any extended thought to this truthful but distressing response. I had assumed that somehow "the system" would always operate rather precisely according to plan. Today, as the increasingly discordant presidency of Donald Trump coincides with a North Korean nuclear standoff, continued Iranian nuclearization, and a casually-announced US-plan for INF Treaty abrogation, General Taylor's 1976 warning takes on greater and possibly more conspicuous meaning. Now, however reluctantly, Americans must realistically assume that if President Trump were ever to exhibit unstable decision-making behavior, he could nonetheless order the use of American nuclear weapons, and plainly do so without any calculable expectations of official "disobedience."

At this point, a core question should come immediately to mind. What should be done by the National Command Authority (Secretary of Defense, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor, and presumptively several others) if it should ever decide to oppose a determinably inappropriate presidential order to launch American nuclear weapons? Could the National Command Authority reliably "save the day" by acting in an impromptu or creatively <em>ad hoc </em>fashion? Or should there already be in place aptly credible and effective statutory measures to (1) meaningfully assess the ordering president's reason and judgment; and (2) promptly countermand any wrongful order?

In law, Article 1 (Congressional) war-declaring expectations of the <em>Constitution </em>notwithstanding, any presidential order to use nuclear weapons, whether issued by an apparently irrational president, or by an otherwise incapacitated one, should be obeyed. To do otherwise, in such dire circumstances, would be <em>prima facie</em> illegal; that is, impermissible on its face. Additionally, President Trump could order the <em>first use</em> of American nuclear weapons even if the US were not under a specifically nuclear attack.

Here, too, a further strategic and legal distinction must be made between <em>first use</em> and <em>first strike</em>. There exists an elementary but vitally important difference, one that candidate Donald Trump had conspicuously failed to understand during his 2016 campaign debates. Among other things, this difference has to do with distinguishing elements of essential national self-defense from aggression.

Aggression, of course, is a codified crime under international law. It is, therefore, reciprocally prohibited by pertinent US law.

Where should American nuclear policy go from here? To begin, a coherent and comprehensive answer will need to be prepared for the following very basic question: If faced with any presidential order to use nuclear weapons, and not offered sufficiently appropriate corroborative evidence of any actually impending existential threat, would the National Command Authority: (1) be willing to disobey?, and (2) be capable of enforcing such seemingly well-founded expressions of authoritative disobedience?

In any such unprecedented nuclear crisis circumstances, all relevant decisions could have to be made in a compressively time-urgent context. Significantly, such excruciatingly tight chronological constraints could quickly become overriding.

The only time for Americans to prepare for such vital national security questions is now. This is the case whether or not President Donald Trump should incrementally prove himself to be an ostensibly stable and capable crisis decision-maker. Though we might draw a huge sigh of relief if the president's most recent treaty-abrogation bravado vis-à-vis Moscow were to subside, there will inevitably arise other similar or even more portentous "atomic" emergencies. To respond purposefully, as needed, the US and certain of its allies will then require more than a purely stream-of-consciousness or seat-of-the-pants prescription from the White House.

Much more.

There is one last but still important point. Whether it is in reference to a proposed military intervention or to another considered military action, the American president is bound not only by US law, but also by international law. The latter, which is discoverable in various customary norms as well as in bilateral and multilateral treaties, is always an integral part of American law. Such "incorporation" is most prominently expressed at Article 6 of the <em>US Constitution</em> (the "Supremacy Clause"), but also at various unambiguously major US Supreme Court decisions.

Looking ahead, Donald Trump's policies for dealing with any and all adversarial nuclear threats must remain fully consistent with American military requirements and also with all corollary jurisprudential obligations. Striking the necessary and optimal balance between both coinciding imperatives will confront this president with certain stark intellectual and ethical dilemmas. For now, at least, it does not appear likely that he will be able to satisfactorily meet such bewildering and overlapping challenges.

There is more. In further sustaining a system of mutual nuclear deterrence, even under the most optimal assumptions of a common rationality, both President Trump and President Putin would have to concern themselves with all possible miscalculations, errors in information, unauthorized uses of strategic weapons, mechanical or computer malfunctions, and myriad assorted nuances of cyber-defense/cyber-war. In other words, even if both President Trump and President Putin were abundantly capable, humane and focused - a generous assumption, to be sure - areas of confrontation could still descend rapidly toward some form or other of genuine nuclear conflict.

It is also reasonable to expect that the corresponding erasure of a once-prevailing nuclear taboo could substantially heighten the likelihood of catastrophic nuclear engagements in certain other parts of the globe, most plausibly in North/South Korea, southwest Asia (Pakistan and India), and/or the Middle East (Israel and Iran). Regarding this last dyad of possible nuclear conflict, such an engagement could ensue even in the absence of a bilateral nuclear capacity; in other words, even before Iran were itself to become recognizably nuclear.

&nbsp;

When Pericles delivered his famous Funeral Oration, it was to express confidence in an ultimate victory for Athens. Simultaneously, as recalled by Thucydides, the Greek historian of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE), Pericles had also expressed various deep fears about self-imposed setbacks along the way. "What I fear more than the strategies of our enemies," lamented Pericles, "is our own mistakes."

Today, as President Trump must finally go far beyond purely unhelpful expressions of self-praise, the expected consequences of any American misunderstandings or miscalculations could prove incalculably destructive to the United States. It follows, <em>inter alia,</em> that in choosing a future style of negotiation and possible escalation with Moscow, the United States must become appropriately wary of locking in to any unwanted patterns of interaction for which the other side's reaction could prove deeply and irremediably harmful to this country. Even more precisely, Mr. Trump and his counselors will have to vigilantly refrain from any provocation for which the Russian "Cold War II" adversary might then have only one anticipated response:  <em>launching a nuclear war.</em>

Nuclear strategy is not for amateurs. As a preeminently intellectual activity, the American president must now do whatever possible to avoid exacerbating an already-expanding nuclear arms race between the superpowers. At the same time, he must maintain a complete awareness that US strategic interests are usefully reinforced by pertinent international law, and that American national security obligations are best satisfied by continuing US support of still-relevant treaties.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the world outrage at the viciousness of reporters’/journalists’ assassination (killing), lawmakers and human rights activists have said “enough.” Under the United States federal law, the Treasury Department is “empowered to prohibit entry into the U.S. and freeze assets of people considered responsible for corruption and human rights violations … effectively blocking their access to the U.S. financial system.” Sections 284 and 3 of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s284/BILLS-114s284rfh.pdf">The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act</a> emphasized that the President have the authority “to impose U.S. entry and property sanctions against any foreign person (or entity) who is responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights committed against individuals in any foreign country seeking to expose illegal activity carried out by government officials, or to obtain, exercise, or promote human rights and freedoms; . . .” In addition to finding a decision by a State not to prosecute results from unwillingness, for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to interfere and prosecute the crimes committed, instead of being prosecuted by the domestic courts, Article 17(3) of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Rome Statute</a> states that the domestic judicial system is incapable of prosecuting criminal acts by launching fair measures to identify the failure of the state’s judiciary. This provision emphasized that ‘due to a total or substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.’ The incapacity of the domestic judicial system could be <em>physically</em> when the state’s judiciary are distorted substantially or <em>legally</em> due to the legal obstacles which render the state’s judiciary (incapability of case’s proceeding).

Within the Egyptian <em>status quo</em>, the state’s physical powerlessness along with the judiciary is out of question, as the substantial collapse is not applicable to the Egyptian scenario, where the three main governmental branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) are sort of functioning theoretically – even without any recognition of separation of powers, checks and balances, and accountability principles. Regarding the legal ability of the Egyptian judicial system, the situation is totally different, as the legal inaccessibility of the judicial system occur in several cases:

<strong>(1)<em> Presidential Immunity</em> </strong>

According to the <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Egypt_2014.pdf">2014 Egyptian Constitution</a>, the President is entitled to a judicial immunity if “A charge of violating the provisions of the Constitution, treason or any other felony against the President…is to be based on a motion signed by at least a majority of the members of the [Congress]. An impeachment is to be issued only by a two-thirds majority of the House’s members and after an investigation to be carried out by the Attorney General . . .” Thus, any charge against the President of treason or of committing a criminal act shall be made upon a proposal by at least one-third of the Congress’s members and no impeachment shall be issued except upon the approval of two-thirds Parliament’s majority. Also, the President’s criminal liability is regulated constitutionally and was governed by Law No. 247/1956, which identifies the procedural rules of the presidential prosecution. In Contrast, Article 27 of the Rome Statute reads expressly that “(a) this Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity […] as a Head of State or Government . . . shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility […], constitute a ground for reduction of sentence, and (b) immunities or special procedural rules … shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.” Accordingly, comparing presidential immunity granted domestically and internationally would reveal that there is a loophole. The impunity granted to Egypt’s President is a <em>mere procedural</em> immunity than a substantive immunity, meaning that he/she neither exempt from the criminal accountability nor the criminal punishment. However, it establishes special procedural rules different than the regular rules applicable in ordinary criminal proceedings (<a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Egypt/Criminal%20Procedures.pdf">Crim. Pro. Code 150/1950</a>).

This debate supported practically by the Egyptian government since the ratification of several international conventions enshrining leader’s responsibility irrespective of the official capacity regarding serious international crimes. For instance, Article 4 of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%2078/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a> stipulates “Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated […] shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals.” Since the Egyptian legal system adopted the <em>monism</em> not the <em>dualism</em> approach, Egypt is bound by the principles they establish. Based on the complementarity principles – and if Egypt decides to ratify the Rome Statute – one could argue that if international crimes were committed and the president’s accountability was invoked for these crimes, the ICC have to check if the national proceedings have been taking place as it would not be able to intervene merely based on the procedural immunity exists under the current domestic Egyptian criminal law. One question is critical, what would be the ICC’s reaction if national courts were incapable of prosecuting the President if required congress’s majority lacks?

It has been argued, that based on the President’s procedural immunity, Egypt would not be – under any obligation – to prosecute the President before a domestic court. This argument creates a serious challenge to the complimentary norm and recalling the broad interpretation of the inability test (judicial system is unattainable) as of procedural limitations. Thus, amending Article 159 of the Constitution is required – not to allow a prosecution before the ICC – but to allow the Egyptian courts to act effectively if core crimes are committed by the president. This excludes the core crimes from the ambit of crimes covered by the current presidential immunity and hence the national courts would be able to prosecute the president for core crimes without the parliamentary threshold. This claim is supported by the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which limits the immunity of the head of states to act relating to <em>jure imperii</em> (public position) but it doesn’t extend to <em>jure gestionis</em> (private acts). The French experience is landmark in this regard, as the French legislator – after a careful examination – of the Rome Statute before ratification, had to amend the Constitution as the latter’s inconsistency with the Statute, especially on presidential immunities.

<strong>(2) </strong><strong><em>Statute of Limitations</em></strong><strong> (<em>Prescription</em>)</strong>

This universal rule justified by the fact that time lapse of discovering the truth becomes increasingly difficult, since ‘evidence disintegrates, testimony by witnesses becomes more difficult or even impossible, the traces of the offense are lost, other means of proof disappear,’ and thus a fair trial for the accused becomes very difficult. Article 15 of the Egyptian Criminal Procedural Code reads “the prosecution of the most serious crimes and felonies are time barred upon the lapse of ten years from the date of their commission” and Article 29 of The Rome Statute provides that “the crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction are not subject to any Statute of limitations.” The non-applicability of prescription to specific crimes is <em>not </em>alien to the Egyptian legal system, as the Constitution <em>per se</em> reads, “[a]ny assault on individual freedom or on the inviolability of private life of citizens and any other public rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and the law shall be considered a crime, whose criminal and civil lawsuit is not liable to prescription.” Moreover, the procedural law ensures the non-applicability of this rule to torture, . . . as Egypt has signed the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.27_convention%20statutory%20limitations%20warcrimes.pdf">International Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory of Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity</a>, it should be applied as an integral part of the Egyptian legislation. So, an appraisal of the <em>status quo</em> would suggest that the non-applicability of this norm to core crimes is not absolute as it doesn’t effectively cover all core crimes. Though, Egypt has ratified universal documents penalizes these crimes, it has not incorporated those into the Penal Code, and the lack of such incorporation would not stand as a ground for renouncing national prosecutions under Articles 17(3) or 20(3). This inability occurs when Egyptian courts is not prosecuting an act counts as a core crime until the barring time has lapsed; hence, the ICC would consider the Egyptian judicial system unable to prosecute. Thus, it’s highly recommended for Egypt, when reviewing its legislation as part of the process of the Statute’s ratification, to incorporate core crimes explicitly into national laws to prevent an indirect intervention of the ICC under Article 17(3) in case of applying statutory limitations to core crimes domestically.

<strong>(3) </strong><strong><em>Adequacy</em></strong><strong> <em>of Domestic Concepts of Core Crimes</em> </strong>

One of these deficiencies is the gap between the ICC crimes and regular crimes, where the former prescribes acts which are not covered domestically or covered inadequately. Fortunately, Egypt ratified the relevant conventions, but has failed to incorporate all crimes prescribed in these agreements into its Penal Code, resulting from the lack of the penalization provisions where the code falls short of covering acts punished under Rome Statute. The current criminal texts offer ambiguous insufficient definitions, which isn’t reflecting the offense’s gravity if compared to the internationally recognized descriptions of these crimes. For example, the definitions of torture, as prescribed under current criminal texts, falls within this domain.

Torture is condemned in the Egyptian Constitution, which provides that any person in detention “shall be treated in a manner concomitant with the preservation of his dignity” and “no physical or moral harm is to be inflicted upon him.” Additionally, the Penal Code provides “Any public official who orders torture or extract a confession under it, he/she shall be sentenced to ten years imprisonment…shall be sentenced to …[p]unishment for premeditated murder.” The Code reads “any official depending on official capacity, used cruelty against anybody, as he/she offended them morally or harmed them physically, he/she shall be sentenced to one-year imprisonment or to be fined of no more than 200 Egyptian Pound.”

The Egyptian policy on torture and the international policy reveals the extent of the defective Egyptian policy. Article 126 of the Penal Code, limits torture to physical attitude either the victim is the accused or coerced to a confession. Article 1 of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/docs/A_RES_39_46-Eng.pdf">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT)</a>, detailed torture’s definition as ‘any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, […]” Despite Article 129 of the Penal Code extension of torture’s meaning to include mental and physical torture ignoring the victim’s status, the punishment is still lenient and doesn’t reflect the crime’s seriousness, as Article 4(2) of the CAT, requires state parties to ‘<em>make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature</em>.’

This defective policy is the foremost problem, as torture has been committed systematically by security apparatus (police officers) nationally and internationally. Some torture cases were prosecuted before the domestic criminal courts, but most of them have been dismissed by the prosecution because of the difficulty of proofing the crime or knowing the actual perpetrator. This deficiency is not only limited to its inadequacy, but also to the confinement of the criminal responsibility to the direct perpetrators (the torturer or who orders it). Thus, the national system would be able, incompetently, to prosecute sporadic cases without being able to reach the senior leaders, as national laws don’t provide such liability’s mode – and those leaders – would be the very perpetrators who’s the ICC is endeavoring to trial. The ‘<em>ordinary crime approach</em>,’ is entirely different than individual and commander’s criminal responsibility. Therefore, if Egypt desires torture to be prosecuted nationally, amending its definition in Article 126 of the Penal Code is required to make it consistent with Article 1 of the CAT or Article 7(2)(f) of the Rome Statute. Also, adopting command responsibility’s mode will allow the national courts to prosecute senior leaders on core crimes.

<strong><em>Harmonizing the Egyptian Legal System within the Rome Statute as a Step Forward</em></strong>

Egypt’s judicial and legal systems regarding punishing core crimes is not advanced as of the Rome Statute, as judiciary might be found impotent to prosecute the core crimes in several cases. This is a direct consequence on the discourse about ratifying the Rome Statute in Egypt. Legal scholars argued about the importance of the complementarity norms, that considered as the cornerstone of the ICC regime – if ratifying the Statute – so, the ICC crimes will be incorporated into the national legal system. A unified Arab legislation (<a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/ArabLeague_ModelImplementationLaw_29Nov05_en.pdf">Model Law</a>) was proposed and formulated to harmonize the Arab legal systems within the Rome Statute within the jurisdiction of the ICC. This law focuses on various principles, as <em>irrelevance of official capacity</em>, <em>ne bis in idem</em> as to acts that have been prosecuted before the ICC along with the non-applicability of the statutory limitations or any form of amnesty (pardon) to any crime, among many others. One could argue that the ‘<em>Model Law</em>’ shows that it has covered numerous gaps of the prevailing Egyptian laws, in a way that would render the judicial system – more – able to handle the core crimes’ prosecutions and block that of the ICC. However, whether this ‘<em>Model Law</em>’ will continue to be a future project – or to be enacted by the parliament – is yet to be realized and dogged.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="gmail_quote">

The Constitution provides that a President has few enumerated powers. He is head of the executive branch and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces (in times of war). That is it.

A President cannot make laws. However, a President can recommend laws for Congress to consider. Also, when a bill is offered to him from the legislative branch for him to sign into law, he has two choices- sign it into law or veto the bill.

Another domestic power of the president is that he can take care that laws be faithfully executed. A president has power only pursuant to laws passed by the legislative branch. That branch has power to make all laws necessary and proper to support presidential powers. Mostly, presidential domestic powers are limited.

There are only two instances where his power inside the borders is plenary: an insurrection and an invasion. As his oath specifically requires, a President is sworn to protect and defend from all enemies foreign or domestic. He or she can protect and defend without the usually required consent by Congress.

As a small group of down trodden immigrants works its slow and agonizing way north through Mexico towards the southern US border seeking sanctuary and asylum, the current President is shouting to his largely white political base that we are being invaded.

Trump has always stoked fear. People are easier to govern when they are afraid and tend to follow their leaders without question. A perfect scenario for a quasi despot such as him. To add to this fear his racist undertones are a further catalyst for that political fear.

Thus, as the midterm elections come to a close, President Trump is ranting that we are being invaded by brown people. He claims that some of the immigrants are Muslim terrorists, and this sets the stage for him seizing on his only plenary power to protect the country from a perceived invasion. He has already ordered federal troops to the border to protect us from the invaders even hinting that for “national security” he would allow them to shoot to kill.

This is illegal under both domestic and international law. The Posse Commitatus Act prohibits federal troops from acting in a law enforcement activity. International Humanitarian Law prohibits the targeting of civilians, except in self-defense.

Under the Department of Defense Law of War Program, our armed forces are trained in the rules of warfare and to understand the principles of military necessity, proportionality, unnecessary suffering, and discrimination. Troops know that an order by a superior, including Commander in Chief, that is illegal under domestic and international law cannot be carried out. Doing so would make both the superior and subordinate criminally liable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Our commanders all know this and are schooled in this through their entire careers.

Hence, this invasion scenario technically allows the President to order the armed forces to use deadly force. But that is an illegal order under the laws of armed conflict and should not be carried out. The migrants are not invading by any definition. They are not posing any threat, militarily or otherwise. Even under the right of self-defense, the act must be a proportional response to the threat. An angry or frustrated human being seeking asylum throwing a rock or two does not justify a deadly response.

Our armed forces have little legal authority to use force within our borders, except in self-defense. They only act as support to law enforcement, the state national guards, or first responders. Only in a real invasion or an insurrection can force be used.

The American People should understand and know better. This is a political stunt to stoke fear so citizens will vote for Trump’s new Republican Party to protect us from this so-called invasion. He blames the migration north on Democrats and progressives fueled by the press, which he also considers a threat to our national security.

President Trump is not doing his constitutional duty of “taking care that the laws be faithfully executed." Instead, he is stepping over the rule of law for his own political gain. This is an impeachable offense in and of itself.

Let’s hope that tomorrow the American People will choose our Constitution over fear.

		<title>The DOJ is finally investigating Catholic Church Sex Crimes, and it Could Catalyze Other Lawsuits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Department of Justice (DOJ) recently launched an investigation into the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania. The central focus of the inquiry seeks to determine whether there have been violations of federal child sex-crimes and related crimes among Church leaders. This investigation raises a number of critical issues, including the potential impacts on American law and society. For the Church, there are no certainties about what the investigation portends for clergy or congregation. In the best-case scenario for church leadership, the investigation could be concluded quickly and painlessly, with little or no legal consequence; more menacingly, the investigation could lead to indictments and trigger investigations far and wide.

The catalyst for the federal investigation was a report released by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in August 2018, detailing its own investigation into the Church. The twenty-three grand jurors who helped compile the report included practicing Catholics who based their reporting on internal documents surrendered by six Dioceses and on testimony from victims. The findings indicated that more than 300 priests in Pennsylvania had sexually abused children over seven decades, and the priests were protected by a hierarchy of church leadership. The findings stated:
<blockquote>Most of the victims were boys; but there were girls too. Some were teens; many were pre- pubescent. Some were manipulated with alcohol or pornography. Some were made to masturbate their assailants, or were groped by them. Some were raped orally, some vaginally, some anally. But all of them were brushed aside, in every part of the state, by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above all.</blockquote>
The report also noted that most perpetrators avoided prosecution due to Pennsylvania’s statute of limitations laws. Within a couple months of the report’s release, federal investigators began knocking on Church doors seeking further information as to whether federal laws were violated. Among various Dioceses in the state, federal investigators have sought subpoenas for internal records to search for a number of items. The information sought includes evidence of church officials moving children across state lines for purposes of sex, evidence of child pornography law violations, and evidence that the church reassigned suspected predators or concealed criminal conduct.

This investigation has been hailed as a <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-probes-catholic-church-in-pennsylvania/2018/10/18/177bd132-d301-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?utm_term=.0a23d4db5a21">first of sorts</a></span> for the DOJ. In the past, crimes in the Church were largely left to internal Church disciplinary procedures or the legal actions of local state authorities. The crimes being investigated in this instance, however, are federal, which opens up a new frontier for federal prosecution.

As the grand jury report noted, Pennsylvania had successfully prosecuted less than a handful of individuals for such crimes. Under federal law, however, the outcomes could be radically different. In the federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. § 3299 eliminates the <span><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL31253.pdf">statute of limitations</a></span> in child sexual abuse cases arising under the specific statutory provisions. This means that many of the crimes that could not be prosecuted under state law might very well be pursued under federal law. Moreover, other crimes may still fit into the general five-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, including potential conspiracy and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations. The federal investigation represents a starker situation for the Church in particular because unlike the state inquiry, this one represents a standing opportunity to extend the investigation beyond Pennsylvania’s borders.

One of the overarching questions raised by the federal investigation centers on how candid the Church will be with secular authorities. As church leaders have already demonstrated ongoing predilection for concealing wrongdoing among its clergy, it is uncertain how forthcoming and open they will be when it comes to complying with government requests. The situation leaders now face is qualitatively different from the state’s investigation, where offenders were guaranteed shelter under the state’s statute of limitations law. Under federal law, however, the possibility of many more prosecutions may change church leaders’ willingness to cooperate. This reality raises the stakes for the Church and makes it more likely that leaders will be more resistant to the DOJ than they were to state investigators.

Another concern is how the federal government’s investigation will impact state lawmaking and public opinion of the church. Already there is a movement among states, including Pennsylvania, to revise statute of limitations laws to open up the possibility of more prosecutions. With these and other investigations into the Church, it seems that public sentiment of the Church sours by day. As one <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/16/me-too-catholic-church-predator-priests-abuse">commentator</a></span> noted about the state investigation, “It’s time for #MeToo in the Catholic Church.” One might speculate how further federal action might cause disaffection among church members or be a spark for genuine reform.

Perhaps the most important issue that these questions raise is what widescale prosecution might mean for the Church. In other words, what if more states moved to revise their statute of limitations laws? What if the federal investigation in Pennsylvania serves as a blueprint for other federal investigations across the country? How would the Church defend itself from sustained prosecutions at state and federal levels? What kind of drain might this entail financially to defend members? What is the scope and scale of liability that the Church may be looking at long term?

From a financial perspective, such developments could prove costly. For victims, it would bring justice to a sordid story because for centuries the Church has collected tax-free money in donations to become among the wealthiest organizations in the world. Yet during many of these years, its clergy committed unspeakable acts against children; and worse, leadership spent Church resources including money, time and effort to hide these facts. Thus, for some, if the Church were forced to disgorge its wealth to fund defense efforts and pay victims’ restitution, it would be “just desserts.” At the extreme, this investigation forces one to imagine a future in which dollars and wealth flow from the Church to victims, the state, and to the legal profession that would perform the legal labor.

With an array of potential defendants in Pennsylvania alone, the scale of liability is seismic and could morph into one of the greatest legal Goliaths the Church has ever faced. Indeed, if the DOJ prosecutes offenders from the Church the way it has prosecuted drug offenders, the prospects of large-scale prosecution could drastically alter the complexion and coffers of the Church. Hence, if the DOJ were to trod this path, it would represent a new era in enforcement, and simultaneously, an end to the DOJ’s hands-off approach to prosecuting Church leaders. For many victims and sympathizers, these developments would be welcome, even if they are tardy, and even if many of the most ruthless and heinous individuals will never be brought to earthly justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Consumers rely on listed prices being accurate. Imagine walking into your favorite store, bringing your desired item to the counter, and being told that the price you had to pay had little relation to the listed price. Remarkable as it is, this is commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry.

Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson recently filed a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.385627/gov.uscourts.njd.385627.2.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> challenging deceptive pricing among insulin manufacturers Novo Nordisk, Sanofi-Aventis, and Eli Lilly. The complaint alleges that the list prices charged by these companies have little to do with the actual prices paid by consumers. The complaint also alleges that such <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/minnesota-sues-insulin-manufacturers-over-pricing/">deceptive pricing</a> harms patients who have high-deductible health plans, patients who have no insurance or pay coinsurance, and patients who are Medicare beneficiaries or in the Minnesota Department of Corrections.

For the nearly <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/">10% of Americans with diabetes</a>, insulin can mean the difference between life and death. Many of these individuals require insulin injections because their pancreas is unable to effectively regulate blood sugar levels. In fact, diabetic patients who do not take their prescribed insulin doses “have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4816603/">increased risks</a> of macrovascular complications (such as heart failure and cardiovascular disease) [and] microvascular complications (including lower limb amputation, blindness, kidney failure).” Insulin takes two forms: rapid-acting (which begins working 15 minutes after injection and lasts two to four hours) and long-acting (which begins working several hours after injection and lasts 24 hours).

There is no question that insulin saves lives. But is it a product of recent innovation that justifies high prices? It is not. Manufacturers often justify price increases by pointing to research expenditures, which can be significant and not certain to result in successful new products. A high-priced drug is better than no drug, so the argument goes.

That argument does not work here, however. Insulin is not a recent phenomenon — it was <a href="http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/48/12/2270">discovered in 1922</a>! And by the mid-1990s, “scientists had created man-made, or analog, insulin, which could be adjusted to allow for different absorption times and more effective management of blood sugar.” The complaint alleges that list price increases are not justified because the manufacturers “have made no meaningful improvement to their products since they introduced them to the market.” In fact, between 2009 and 2014, medical costs fell 14% while pharmacy costs increased 36%.

The complaint notes dramatic price hikes in recent years. Take, for example, the two leading long-acting insulin treatments, whose current prices have nearly tripled within the past decade. Sanofi’s Lantus increased from roughly $99 in 2010 to $270 in 2018, and Novo Nordisk’s Levemir increased from $114 in 2008 to $294. Similarly, the price of rapid-acting insulin also skyrocketed: Novo Nordisk’s NovoLog increased from $133 in 2008 to $289 in 2018; Eli Lilly’s Humalog rose from $123 in 2011 to $275; and Sanofi’s Apidra increased from $93 in 2010 to $270.

The list price of pharmaceuticals is known in the industry as the <a href="https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/understanding-drug-pricing">wholesale acquisition cost</a> (“WAC”). This figure reflects the price at which a manufacturer sells to a wholesaler and does not include rebates or other discounts. The WAC also serves as the benchmark for the average wholesale price (“AWP”)—typically the WAC price plus a 20% markup—which is used to determine the price at which health plans reimburse pharmacies.

One explanation for high prices, ironically enough, involves rebates provided to <a href="https://www.pcmanet.org/our-industry/">pharmacy benefit managers</a> (PBMs). PBMs manage prescription drug benefits for health plans and self-insured employers and are designed to lower price by aggregating purchasing power. In particular, PBMs create networks of pharmacies for health plans and negotiate the rates at which the health plans reimburse pharmacies. While PBMs may have initially reduced prices, the evidence now points in the opposite direction.

One reason for this reversal is that the PBMs run formularies (lists of drugs covered by health plans). It is crucial for manufacturers that their drugs appear on formularies; otherwise, health plans will not cover them. PBMs have particular power in the context of insulin drugs, which are “<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.385627/gov.uscourts.njd.385627.2.0.pdf">largely interchangeable</a>.” As a result, PBMs need only include one long-acting insulin and one rapid-acting insulin on their formularies, which encourages manufacturers to do everything possible to enter into PBMs’ good graces.

How do they do that? By providing <a href="https://www.policymed.com/2017/03/cms-releases-report-on-drug-rebates.html">rebates</a>. As the complaint alleges: “[M]anufacturers obtain placement of their products on PBM formularies by offering rebates to the PBM.” Drugmakers “offer PBMs larger rebates for giving their product preferred status over a competing one,” which means that the drug will be less expensive and might even benefit from its rival’s exclusion from the formulary.

And how do manufacturers pay for increasing rebates? By increasing the list price. The complaint points to statements from drugmakers that admitted this. Novo Nordisk conceded that “as the rebates, discounts and price concessions got steeper,” it was “losing considerable revenue,” which led to it “increas[ing] the list [price] in an attempt . . . to maintain a profitable and sustainable business.” Similarly, Eli Lilly “admitted that it increases its list prices because ‘PBMs demand higher rebates in exchange for including the drug on their preferred-drug lists.’”

Exacerbating the situation, the manufacturers have an incentive to follow their rivals in increasing list prices. This is unlike other markets, where a rival’s price hike typically is not matched by competitors, who could attract more customers by offering a lower price. In contrast, in this setting, one company’s increased list price signals a heightened rebate to the PBM. To be able to compete with the first-mover’s rebates (while maintaining profit margins), the follower will increase its list price as well. That explains why the price of insulin drugs has significantly risen across the board.

The complaint notes the deceptive nature of this wide gap between list price (which is published) and net price (which is secret). For example, the difference between Lantus’s list and net prices increased from 16 to 136 percent between 2009 and 2015, and the difference between NovoLog’s list and net prices is more than 315 percent. Patients with high-deductible health plans, those who are uninsured or pay coinsurance, and Medicare Part D beneficiaries all lack information regarding rebates and “expect that [list] prices are an accurate representation” of a drug’s value. This information may lead them to find that “their life-saving medications [have become] unaffordable.” In short: “the list prices that [drugmakers] set are so far from their net prices that [they] no longer are an accurate approximation of the actual net price of insulin and are deceptive and misleading.”

The complaint alleges <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-109-rico-charges">RICO violations</a>, deceptive trade practices, false advertising, and unjust enrichment against each of the manufacturers. It seeks an injunction preventing the defendants from “publishing or otherwise disseminating deceptive or misleading list prices” and seeks damages, including disgorgement of profits.

With list prices having little to do with reality, pricing in the pharmaceutical industry is notoriously secretive and misleading. In shining a bright light on this model, this lawsuit promises to be important.

		<title>History Repeating Itself: The First Amendment in the Era of “Fake News”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Following a combative news conference with reporters the day after the 2018 midterm elections, President Trump took the exceptionally rare act of suspending the White House credentials of long-time CNN Chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. The announcement came the day after Acosta confronted President Trump with a series of questions about the President’s portrayal of a Central American migrant caravan as an “invasion.”

The President responded defensively to Acosta’s questioning, quipping, “Honestly, I think you should let me run the country — you run CNN.” After a White House intern tried unsuccessfully to retrieve the microphone from Acosta’s hand, President Trump said that Mr. Acosta was “a rude, terrible person.” Later that evening, when Acosta tried to re-enter the White House, a member of the Secret Service asked him to relinquish his “hard pass,” which grants journalists entry to the compound.

This incident is the latest in a litany of attacks President Trump has waged on what he has dubbed the “fake news” media. Indeed, while the 280-character limitation of Twitter makes a nuanced communication of executive policy almost impossible, it has been an effective medium for President Trump to denigrate the press and dismiss criticism as fake news. Even more disturbing than his verbal vilification of journalists who question his policies is the President’s wielding of power to silence his critics. President Trump has launched threats – and in some instances has acted – to quiet his critics. He has <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918112884630093825">threatened</a> to revoke broadcast licenses from networks that have launched criticism of him and has interfered with press access on several occasions, including banning reporters from rallies, news conferences, and other official events.

President Trump is not the first president to harbor resentment toward the media. Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Harry Truman, and Richard Nixon all had strained relationships with the media. In a 1955 <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/05/17/harry-truman-trashed-the-media-long-before-donald-trump/">letter</a>, President Truman wrote that “Presidents and the members of their Cabinets and their staff members have been slandered and misrepresented since George Washington . . . when the press is friendly to an administration the opposition has been lied about and treated to the excrescence [sic] of paid prostitutes of the mind.” President Nixon’s short term in office was plagued by an especially tumultuous relationship with the media. Moved by his own paranoia and the embarrassing revelations about his role in the Watergate scandal, Nixon assembled a <a href="https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/2018-07/04unit-358.pdf">list</a> of press “enemies” and had them audited. He went so far as to ban a reporter from the White House after the reporter wrote a story critical of Nixon in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> raising concerns about the cost for taxpayers of Nixon’s decision to maintain two personal properties.

While these previous presidential eras were marked by a general cynicism of the press, President Trump’s condemnation of any reporting he characterizes as fake news has amplified the public’s distrust of the media to a dangerous level.

Indeed, the President’s anti-press rhetoric and his attempt to control public debate by silencing those who disagree with him pose serious First Amendment concerns. In attempting to manipulate what he has dubbed the “fake news” media and to silence citizen-critics by blocking them from the public comment space on his social media pages, he is undermining the central meaning of the First Amendment and shackling political speech.

Over a half century ago, the United States Supreme Court in <em><a href="http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep376/usrep376254/usrep376254.pdf">New York Times v. Sullivan</a></em> clarified the vital role of the First Amendment Free Speech Clause in preserving the “marketplace of ideas.” The <em>Sullivan</em> case represented a seismic shift in the nation’s First Amendment free speech jurisprudence. In considering a public official’s libel claim against the New York Times, the Court restricted the extent to which the government may limit the press in its ability to criticize the government. Describing the central meaning of the First Amendment Free Speech Clause as a commitment to the principle of “uninhibited, robust, and wide-open” debate, the Court underscored that “vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials” are not immune from First Amendment constitutional protections.

By enshrining the central values of the First Amendment, the <em>Sullivan </em>Court solidified the goals of promoting self-governance, eliminating deterrents to uninhibited public discourse, and thwarting tyranny. That is why it is axiomatic that the government cannot silence speakers based solely on a disagreement with the speaker’s viewpoint.

But, in the Trump era, criticism of the President has been labeled unpatriotic. Not unlike the English seditious libel laws, which our forefathers eschewed, the truth of the assertion is immaterial. In fact, historically, the truer a criticism of the King was, the harsher the penalty. Although President Trump does not have the power to impose criminal sanctions on those who criticize him, his vitriolic response to criticism can affect the economic welfare of his critics and the country’s overall well-being.

A 2018 national <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/june_2018/51_say_trump_to_blame_for_bad_relationship_with_press">survey</a> conducted by Rasmussen Reports indicates that 51% of U.S. voters think the president is more to blame for his tumultuous relationship with most traditional media outlets, while 42% feel it is the media’s fault. During a particularly fragile moment in history when the country is profoundly divided, the President’s anti-press rhetoric has further polarized opposition viewpoints and created a deeper schism among those who support the President and those who oppose him. Instead of trying to harmonize these diverging groups, the President, occupying a world stage, has characterized the media as “<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1056879122348195841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2018%2F10%2F29%2Ftrump-slams-media-as-true-enemy-of-the-people-days-after-cnn-targeted.html">the enemy of the people</a>,” breeding skepticism and perpetuating fear in the minds of Americans who look to the President for cues about whom to trust. In discrediting the mainstream media, President Trump has stifled political discourse and weakened the traditional role of the press as a check on government abuses.

Whether it’s his bashing of the “fake news” media or his decision to block journalists that question his policies, President Trump’s caustic rhetoric and attack on the press are an onslaught of the very First Amendment principles that form the basis of our democracy. Ultimately, the American people are resilient and can reclaim the freedom of the press as a check on government. The judiciary may also play an important role in preserving the marketplace of ideas that was central to the <em>Sullivan</em> Court’s safeguarding of the First Amendment. Without those checks, should President Trump continue to bash the media and censor reporters that challenge him, his time in office will become akin to that of a 17th century monarch.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">This past Election Day, voters in Massachusetts made history by winning a popular vote on transgender rights at the statewide ballot box for the first time. At a time when so many transgender people are being attacked by the Trump administration and violence against transgender people remains an epidemic in America (with the highest rates of violence targeting transgender women of color), this victory sends a resounding message that the transgender community is worthy of being treated with dignity and respect, and should have equal protections codified under the law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The work to update Massachusetts law to include explicit and comprehensive protections for transgender people from discrimination was more than a decade in the making, beginning in 2007; and included negotiations among a broad coalition of stakeholders involved in crafting the language of the bill. In 2011, the legislature successfully passed transgender nondiscrimination protections in areas of employment, housing, credit, and education. At the last minute, lawmakers carved out protections in places of public accommodation such as restaurants, stores, hotels, government buildings, and doctors' offices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In 2015, Freedom for All Massachusetts formed in order to finish our work, and ensure protections in places of public accommodation. We recruited a groundbreaking coalition of supporters and allies, including hundreds of businesses, faith leaders, labor unions representing hundreds of thousands of families, and the state's major experts working on women's safety, including the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, the Massachusetts Major City Chiefs, and the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence. These institutions and experts testified to the well known fact that there was no correlation between protecting transgender people and an increase in public safety incidents. The legislation was signed by Republican Governor Charlie Baker and passed by a bipartisan supermajority of lawmakers in both chambers. Shortly after these protections went into effect, opponents of the law collected the small number of signatures -- less than 33,000, or less than one percent of the state population -- needed to force it onto the November 2018 ballot. A "yes" vote on question 3 would uphold the current law, while a "no" vote repealed that provision of the public accommodations law.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The No on 3 campaign lacked substantive infrastructure or paid staff, but the messages they attempted to send to the electorate were predicated on misinformation and lies that have no legs to stand on from a legal perspective. While our campaign for </span><a href="https://www.freedommassachusetts.org/videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes on 3 aired informative ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from a diverse array of messengers expressing support for the transgender nondiscrimination law and introducing voters to real people who would be affected by the outcome, the No side's primary ad featured actors depicting a shadowy and unrealistic hypothetical man spying on a woman in a locker room. In media interviews and debates surrounding the ballot question, the "No" side pointed to a handful of seemingly random instances across the country to demonstrate the supposed harms of the law. However, it was telling that they could not find a single actual person to speak publicly as a surrogate in their ad. That being said, it's easy to dispel, practically and legally, any notion that ensuring basic protections for transgender people empowers criminals to enjoy increased access to women's spaces to commit crimes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The truth is, not a single person in any of the cases that No on 3 put forth ever included a person who committed a crime and claimed to be transgender, or claimed protection because of the transgender nondiscrimination law. In fact, in one of the most notable cases the No side continually brought up regarding a man in Plainville, Massachusetts who had photographed a woman in a restroom, the suspect was arrested and charged - as he should have been. Opponents of transgender equality claimed that the definition of gender identity under Massachusetts law was too broad and opened the door to abuse, but it's actually the opposite. State law defines being transgender as an identity that is deeply and sincerely held and consistently asserted -- it's not something that someone can wake up one day and pretend in order to do things they shouldn't. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, </span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/09/oi/ag-healey-gender-identity-guidance-for-public-accommodations-9-1-16.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">guidelines by the attorney general's office </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination state that gender identity cannot be asserted or abused for any improper purpose. Anyone who is suspected of doing something inappropriate or illegal can be questioned, detained, and reported to law enforcement. Any person who sees something suspicious can say something without penalty -- that's just common sense. Fines can only be issued to businesses -- not individuals -- who are proven to commit multiple instances of discrimination over many years. That's why the state's leading women's organizations and public safety experts endorsed the Yes on 3 campaign. Criminals don't follow the law in the first place -- that's why they are criminals. But it's not a crime to be in a public place and also be transgender. These protections ensure that transgender people can't face harassment or discrimination simply because of who we are -- that's what this law is about, nothing more or less.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender people value privacy, safety, and modesty like everyone else. In fact, transgender people often seek out unisex or gender-neutral spaces because we have faced such rampant rates of discrimination and negative experiences. But we shouldn't be required to. There is no reason to think that transgender people cause distress in restrooms any more than any other type of person -- and potential discomfort of a small minority of non-transgender people isn't a legitimate reason for discrimination. From a legal perspective, creating carve-outs for certain groups of people in certain provisions of law -- i.e., protecting transgender people from discrimination in all public places with the exception of restrooms and locker rooms -- isn't even sustainable or enforceable. And if No on 3 genuinely cared about preventing sexual violence or keeping criminals out of vulnerable spaces, they should work with the dozens of organizations who do the work every day to protect women and who endorsed Yes on 3, not repeal basic protections for transgender people or hurtfully equate us with criminals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes on 3 ran a campaign highlighting transgender voices, showcasing a groundbreaking coalition of more than 1,500 stakeholders and influencers across the state in support of these protections, and debunking any misunderstanding that these protections could harm safety. From a legal perspective, such claims fall to shreds; but as the Massachusetts electorate has proven, it doesn't take a lawyer to see that these lies are nonsensical and simply false. Our campaign was about treating all people with dignity and respect, including transgender people. Will discrimination against transgender people in Massachusetts end simply because a law was passed and upheld? Of course not. But the power of these protections, passed by a supermajority of legislators and subsequently </span><a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/11/06/question-3-transgender-ballot-yes-wins?fbclid=IwAR0tIwgOYExsynQwbvvUAc5lv8lRZ9YZQs6VrkzvmjntIqwB71tzT4OTngM"><span style="font-weight: 400">upheld by 68% of voters,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> sends a strong message to the transgender community, here and across the country. I hope that other states take Massachusetts' lead, until a day where all transgender people can enjoy full legal equality, as well as lived equality, no matter what state they call home.</span>

		<title>A Triumphant Incoherence: President Trump&#039;s Convulsive War on Government and Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["The enemy is the unphilosophical spirit which knows nothing and wants to know nothing of truth."

Karl Jaspers, <em>Reason and Anti-Reason in our Time</em> (1971)

Yet again, assessments of national security threats to the United States thoroughly contradict US President Trump's own off-the-cuff appraisals. This time it is about satellite images confirming that North Korea is rapidly moving ahead with its ballistic missile program at sixteen hidden bases. An article in <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdavid-e.-sanger&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection">The New York Times by David E. Sanger and William J. Broad</a></span> explains that these unacknowledged bases "contradict Mr. Trump's assertion that his landmark diplomacy is leading to the elimination of a nuclear and missile program that the North had warned could devastate the United States."

This new report by distinguished American journalists is merely the latest and potentially most egregious example of an American president systematically disregarding his own capable intelligence community merely to curry favor with his political base. Of course, there will be meaningful consequences of such presidential dereliction for principal US allies in the region, most obviously South Korea and Japan.

Somehow, for the current American president, policy-making amid chaos (or by chaos) has fully become the new normal. Rejecting all the usual standards of science, reason, and a measured philosophical spirit, Donald Trump has embraced a posture of deliberate incoherence. As a result, virtually all issues of US government and law are now just another inane pretext for presidential convulsions.

Credo quia absurdum or, I believe because it is absurd, said the ancient philosophers. "Reason," warns the philosopher Karl Jaspers, "is confronted again and again with the fact of a mass of believers who have lost all ability to listen, who can absorb no logical argument, and who hold unshakably fast to the Absurd...." Very systematically, this president avoids knowledge-based judgments. Rather than think seriously about stunningly complex issues, he erupts. On even the most urgent existential matters of US national security, Mr. Trump remains prepared to sacrifice the long-term well-being of an entire nation for his personal enhancement.

What Mr. Trump has so evidently done wrong concerning North Korean nuclearization is just the tip of his dereliction iceberg. Very recently, the <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/20/trump-us-nuclear-arms-treaty-russia">president declared</a></span> his inclination to unilaterally abrogate this country's legal obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. This abrogation will impair our codified promises at both international and domestic legal levels. Before this latest proposed abrogation, <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-will-announce-plans-to-pull-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-pleas-from-european-leaders/2018/05/08/4c148252-52ca-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html">Mr. Trump withdrew</a></span> the United States from the July 2015 Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). That decision was made after <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-adhering-to-nuclear-deal-with-world-powers-un-watchdog-says/2017/08/31/cb408e7d-bc9a-4874-bbdf-001f919a8c86_story.html">UN's International Atomic Energy Agency claimed</a></span> Tehran had been meticulously respecting the deal.

There are still further examples of President Trump acting in unsupportable opposition to America's legal and moral obligations. These include his proposed treatment of Central American refugees at the US border (including demonization of the now famous "caravan"); his incomprehensible threats to cut funding to US victims of both <span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1054755401651179521">hurricanes</a></span> and <span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1061168803218948096">terrible fires</a></span> in the midst of their sufferings; his de facto complicity with Saudi Arabia in Riyadh's <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2016/07/hrw-urges-inquiry-into-saudi-arabia-coalition-airstrikes/">bombing of vulnerable civilian populations in Yemen</a></span>; similar complicity with Russia regarding regime-inflicted war crimes in Syria; <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2017/06/trump-us-to-pull-out-of-the-paris-climate-deal/">US withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord</a></span>; consistently <span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/bogus-voter-fraud-claims/">baseless voter fraud claims</a></span>; persistent and unrequited obeisance to Russia's Vladimir Putin; and very limp reactions to the Saudi murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. These are just some examples.

Refusing to base his foreign policy judgments on gathered intelligence or prepared proposals, President Trump undermines his core Constitutional obligations. Ironically, Donald Trump is keenly fond of chastising others about purported legal obligations:  "This is a nation of laws....,” he has warned on several occasions. But Mr. Trump himself has simply chosen to look the other way.

International law remains an integral part of the law of the United States, and can't be overlooked by any president or by his defenders. Most obviously and unassailably, critically vital incorporations of international law are expressly codified at Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution (the "Supremacy Clause") and also at several corresponding U.S. Supreme Court decisions (principally, the 1900 <span><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/175/677/">Paquete Habana</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/517/542/2386834/">Tel-Oren vs. Libyan Arab Republic</a></span>, 1981).

Article 6 of the US Constitution clarifies that "...all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land...." In this connection, the United States is a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which contains (at Article 33) the basic principle of non-refoulement:  "No Contracting State shall expel or return ("refouler") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion."

The absence of reason behind Trump’s assertions might never become a conscious cause for presidential embarrassment. As cameras pan around the audience at Mr. Trump's fearfully adrenalized rallies, it's hard to imagine even a scintilla of crowd interest in law, logic or just plain lucidity. In the fashion of other bedazzled (or bewitched) audiences in earlier 20th century European history, this is not a crowd that wants its "great leader" to be impressively learned or law-minded. Credo quia absurdum.

In all his flagrant violations of the US and international law, Mr. Trump himself is not the real or genuinely underlying "pathology." Rather, his law and the government-violating presidency is merely the most visible symptom of a much more widespread and deeply systemic disorder. Recalling the German philosopher Karl Jaspers' generic warning drawn from the Third Reich: The really basic "illness" here is a starkly anti-intellectual American society that frowns upon any ascertainable hints of independent thought.

Even in Donald Trump's increasingly deformed universe, the law follows "mass." "The crowd," observed the Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, "is untruth." Always, Mr. Trump's obedient minions obligingly insist upon chanting in chorus. The hideously dark tenor of any such ritualistic chanting should sound more than vaguely familiar in modern European history.

"Intellect rots the brain," cautioned Third Reich Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels at the 1935 Nuremberg rallies. "I love the poorly educated," offered candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Inevitably, Mr. Trump's supporters, yearn openly for the tangible warmth of belonging, of being part of a shrill and shrieking crowd, and of enjoying the false pleasures of simplistic explanations. Complexity is always especially difficult and daunting for those who would unhesitatingly reject intelligence and intellect in virtually any form.

Sophocles called a king who would place his own personal popularity ahead of national well-being "despicable." He lamented (together with his fellow Greek playwrights, Aeschylus and Euripides) that a corrupted national leadership must necessarily engender a more widely corrupted commonwealth. When Theban King Oedipus finally discovers his own terrible "flaw," the Chorus recognizes fully unavoidable connections to the debilitating famine and disorder then prevailing throughout Thebes. Today, when an American president remains doggedly focused on his presumed personal popularity and not on his core legal obligations concerning government, law, and national security, we face similarly perilous connections.

To really understand these vitriolic connections, and then to effectively counter the corollary presidential assaults on government and law, we will first have to reject any sleight-of-hand explanations originating in the Trump White House. Such choreographed political wizardry can only masquerade as truth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>On October 24, 2018</span>, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood <span><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/summons_and_complaint_0.pdf">sued</a></span> <span>Exxon</span> for defrauding investors about the business risks of climate change. Of course, <span>Exxon</span> will probably deny that it committed fraud. But, in anticipation of this day, the oil giant has spent the last two years preparing a far more insidious legal defense: that its fraud is actually protected by the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of speech.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Ever since the New York and Massachusetts attorneys general announced that they were investigating <span>Exxon</span> for possible fraud, the company has been suing to block the investigations themselves. <span>Exxon</span> lost this argument in both the <span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/04/13/SJC12376%20EXXON%20MOBIL%20CORPORATION%20vs%20ATTORNEY%20GENERAL.pdf.pdf">Massachusetts state supreme court</a></span> and in <span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/03/29/Exxon%20SDNY%20Decision.pdf">New York federal court</a></span>, where the judge took <span>Exxon</span> to task for its “<u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/climate/exxon-climate-change.html">implausible” theories and “thin allegations</a></u>.” But <span>Exxon</span> is doubling down by appealing <span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/10/15/September%2010%2C%202018%20-%20Petition%20by%20Exxon%20for%20writ%20of%20certiorari.pdf">both</a></span> <span><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/08/06/August%203%2C%202018%20%20Brief%20of%20Exxon%20Mobil%20Corporation.pdf">decisions</a></span>, even to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Facing an <u><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/31/exxonmobil-is-trying-to-fend-off-a-shareholder-rebellion-over-climate-change/?utm_term=.df6420347133">investor revolt</a></u>, a <u><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-investigating-exxon-on-valuing-of-assets-accounting-practices-1474393593">federal investigation</a></u>, and investigations by multiple attorneys general into its financial disclosures and public statements on climate change, <span>Exxon</span> chose to go on the offensive. It filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the attorney general investigation into potential violations of securities and consumer protection laws was a pretext to prevent <span>Exxon</span> from exercising freedom of speech. <span>Exxon</span>’s primary basis for this meritless claim was <u><a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/exxon-mobil/2018/03/29/judge-dismisses-exxons-lawsuit-letting-multi-state-fraud-investigation-continue">a press conference and a mountain of speculation.</a></u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">In reality, Massachusetts’ and New York’s highest law enforcement officials are treading on solid ground firmly supported by law and precedent. The New York Attorney General already reached a <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2015/11/09/new-york-coal-settlement-could-be-climate-canary/">settlement</a> with Peabody Energy concerning its representations about the potential impacts of climate change to investors and markets in 2015. The Securities and Exchange Commission exacted<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/29/business/worldbusiness/shell-to-pay-150-million-in-fines-for-overstating.html"> a stiff fine</a> from Shell for violating anti-fraud provisions related to overstating its reserves in 2004, and the SEC and major investors in the company have questioned <span>Exxon</span>’s decisions regarding whether to <u><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/exxons-accounting-is-under-investigation">report impairments or write-downs on multiple occasions.</a></u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">A review of the subpoenas and <u><a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2016/10/op/ma-exxon-cid-.pdf">civil investigative demands</a></u> in the cases show a focus on how <span>Exxon</span>’s internal information and analysis squared with its external communications to markets and market actors, such as investors, consumers, and regulators. That is the crux of the case in any securities and consumer protection investigation. The <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-executives.html">Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal</a></u>—where Volkswagen was caught cheating on air pollution tests—provides a helpful analog. Just imagine if Volkswagen, faced with fraud investigations and penalties, had claimed that it was being persecuted for its views on the science of clean air. That is exactly what <span>Exxon</span> is doing here.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, neither investigation has even approached <span>Exxon</span>’s claimed speech rights in the political arena. <span>Exxon</span> <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/current-issues/accountability/political-contributions-and-lobbying/political-contributions-and-lobbying">spends millions</a> in political contributions, independent expenditures, and lobbying every year. But that’s not part of these investigations, and despite the company’s claims that the investigations “chill” its “speech,” <span>Exxon</span> has continued to spend freely to influence elections.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Not long ago, <span>Exxon</span>’s First Amendment argument would have been considered radical. But the reshaping of the Supreme Court into its most <u><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/business/pro-business-decisions-are-defining-this-supreme-court.html">business-friendly incarnation in history</a></u> has rewarded a decades-long corporate campaign to transform the radical into the run-of-the-mill and <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/first-amendment-conservatives-supreme-court.html">weaponize the First Amendment</a></span>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, the <span>Exxon</span> case could become the latest chapter in what one legal scholar has called a <u><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/04/how-corporations-took-over-the-first-amendment/389249/">corporate takeover of the First Amendment</a></u>. The takeover traces back to a <a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/">memo</a> to the Chamber of Commerce by Lewis Powell just before President Richard Nixon nominated him to serve on the Supreme Court. As a long-time advocate for the tobacco industry and board member of Philip Morris, Powell was concerned about the widespread public support for environmental and consumer protections. Not only did Powell call upon the Chamber to lead a coordinated attack by business, but he highlighted the importance of appealing to <u><a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/1/">“an activist-minded Supreme Court.”</a></u></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, corporations have sought, and increasingly<u><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-18/how-america-s-corporations-won-their-civil-rights">,</a></u> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-07-18/how-america-s-corporations-won-their-civil-rights">have been given</a> protections once reserved for the most vulnerable and marginalized voices in society. Four decades later, the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company in the world is claiming that its “speech” in the economic marketplace should be exempted from the scrutiny of securities and consumer protection laws to prevent the chilling of its claimed speech in the marketplace of ideas. These arguments erode the rule of law and run the risk of exempting corporations from accountability altogether. They should be seen for what they are, a radical attack on constitutional principles and the power of the states to protect their people.</p>

		<title>Is Unilateral Revocation of the Indus Water Treaty Permissible Under International Law?</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amid the perpetual political tension between India and Pakistan, the Indus water treaty (IWT) is perhaps the only international instrument which has proactively engaged both the countries in bilateral relationship. In fact, the treaty has been the most significant confidence building measure between India and Pakistan since 1960. Despite multiple wars and hostilities between the two countries, the treaty remained undisturbed and survived for more than five decades since its conclusion. After the Uri attack in 2016, India hinted towards unilaterally scraping the IWT. This has been objected to by Pakistan which has warned that any attempts by India to unilaterally revoke the IWT will result in the flagrant violation of its international treaty obligations and shall be treated as an “act of aggression” under international law. The present piece is an attempt to explore whether unilateral withdrawal by India from IWT violates the international law in general and amounts to “act of aggression” in particular as argued by Pakistan.

The Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT) 1969 provides for the termination or withdrawal from a treaty. Article 54 of VCLT states that the termination of the treaty or the withdrawal of a party from the treaty may take place either in accordance with the provisions of the particular treaty or, at any time, by the consent of all parties after the consultation with the other contracting states. Further article 56 of the VCLT provides for the ‘Denunciation of or withdrawal from a treaty containing no provisions regarding termination, denunciation or withdrawal’. Article 56, Para 1 states that a treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination and which does not provide for the denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless it is established that the parties intended to admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal or a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty. Article 12 (4) of the treaty provides that,
<blockquote><em>            “ the  provisions of this treaty, or the provisions of this treaty as modified under the          provisions of  paragraph (3), shall continue in force until terminated by a duly ratified    treaty concluded for that  purpose between the two  governments. The termination of the treaty is possible only if both India and Pakistan agree in writing. In other words, a termination treaty has to be drafted by both states and then ratified by both, to bring the   IWT to an end. The treaty has no provision for unilateral “suspension”. </em></blockquote>
In other words, a termination treaty has to be drafted by both states and then ratified by both, to bring the IWT to an end.  It would not be incorrect to assert that IWT is not regime-specific — but rather state-specific. It will not expire with regime change. It is binding on both the states equally and offers no exit provision.  Therefore, so far as the question of IWT is concerned neither India nor Pakistan can unilaterally revoke it unless it consults the other party and obtains its consent in the form of an agreement in writing regarding the termination of the treaty.  The obligation to consult and obtain consent of the other parties to the treaty has its origin in the 1871 London Declaration which states that,<em> “it is an essential principle of the Law of the Nations that no power can liberate itself from the engagement of the treaty, nor modify the stipulation thereof, unless with the consent of the contracting parties by means of an amicable arrangement”</em>.  It is generally believed that a treaty is intended to be of perpetual duration and incapable of unilateral termination, unless, expressly or by implication, it contains a right of unilateral termination or some other provisions for its coming to an end. In the light of above discussion, it can be successfully argued that the IWT cannot be terminated unilaterally by any party. If any party does so it would lead to the violation of the principle of <em>Pacta Sunt Servanda</em> which is a well-accepted customary principle of the international law.  Therefore, it would entail the State responsibility of the party which has unilaterally withdrawn from it. Now, so far as the question of consent of the other party regarding the withdrawal from the treaty is concerned, it is clear that Pakistan has expressly objected to any such move of India regarding the unilateral revocation of the IWT.

Another inquiry is whether unilateral withdrawal from the treaty by India would amount to the ‘act of aggression’ under international law. The General Assembly Resolution of 3314 (XXIX) which deals with the Definition of Aggression is relevant to the present Context.  It defines Aggression as the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this Definition. Article 3 of the Resolution lists out the different acts which may qualify as aggression. It is interesting to note that act of unilateral revocation of the treaty does not find a place under any of the acts mentioned in the article 3 of the resolutions.  Almost similar definition of aggression was adopted under article 8 bis of the statute of ICC. Therefore it could be asserted that Pakistan’s claim that the unilateral revocation of the IWT by India would amount to the act of aggression does not find any support under general international law.

Another issue which is often flagged by India regarding the termination or withdrawal from IWT is the ‘act of terrorism’ by Pakistan. The factual veracity of claims of terrorism is beside the point. The attempt here is to examine the correctness of this legal claim at a theoretical level alone. It has been argued by the Indian side that the Pakistan’s involvement in the act of terrorism against India has resulted in the Fundamental Change of Circumstances under international law with respect to IWT.  The fundamental change of circumstances has been codified under article 62 of the VCLT which has its basis under the customary principle of <em>rebus sic santibus</em>. Article 62 provides that a fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties can be invoked by the State as a ground for the termination or withdrawal from the treaty if two conditions are fulfilled.  First, the existence of those circumstances must constitute an essential basis of the consent of the parties to be bound by the treaty. Second, the effect of the change is radically to transform the extent of obligations still to be performed under the treaty. Thus, a fundamental change of circumstances can be pleaded in situations where either the subject matter of the treaty has been destroyed or the purpose of the treaty has been frustrated.  An act of Terrorism per se neither finds its support in article 62 of VCLT nor in its commentary whether issued by the International Law Commission or by scholars like Mark Villager or Oliver Corten. So far as the IWT is concerned, the drying up of the rivers mentioned in the treaty may constitute fundamental change of circumstances unlike the act of terrorism which has not even remote connection with respect to the performance of the treaty. An act of terrorism would have resulted in the fundamental change of the circumstances if the performance of the obligations under the treaty could not be carried out because of it. Thus, a direct causal relationship needs to be established between the act of terrorism and performance of the IWT between the parties which almost impossible to establish in the present case.

Finally, it can be concluded that any such unilateral revocation of IWT by India or Pakistan would amount to breach of the international obligation which may incur state responsibility of that state under international law. Nevertheless, it is equally true that any such act of unilateral revocation of the treaty by India would not amount to the ‘Act of Aggression’ under international law. It was rightly observed by Ahmer Bilal Soofi a former federal law minister of Pakistan that,
<blockquote><em>“Treaties are state-specific obligations, and not regime- specific. These are not  contingent upon deterioration of political atmosphere. It is much better that the states  implement treaties through mutual trust, but even if there is deterioration of trust on account of extraneous events then that, per se, cannot be the sole reason to consider   revocation of the treaty</em>.”</blockquote>

		<title>Trump&#039;s Defense of Saudi Arabia After Khashoggi Murder Violates Law and Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not just about the <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/12/what-is-the-global-magnitsky-act-and-why-are-u-s-senators-invoking-this-on-saudi-arabia/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b85b966672a2">2012 Magnitsky Act</a></span>. President Donald Trump's recent <span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/417646-trump-affirms-us-loyalty-to-saudi-arabia-in-striking-new-statement">affirmation of support</a></span> for Saudi Arabia–even with incontrovertible evidence of Saudi criminality in the Jamal Khashoggi murder–reflects willful indifference to much wider sources of pertinent law. Both international law and the laws of the United States were flagrantly violated by this official American affirmation.

In part, this legal violation was effectively "dual level." This is because US law is never entirely separable from international law; indeed, it even incorporates this pre-existing law. Such authoritative incorporation follows from certain (1) express <span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Constitutional requirements</a></span>; (2) specific <span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2472562080683506761&amp;q=Tel+Oren+versus+Libyan+Arab+Republic&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Supreme Court</a></span> <span><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5818762505482150880&amp;q=Paquete+Habana&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">rulings</a></span>-; and (3) the more general but equally compelling convergence of  customary legal norms.

A nation's legal behavior must be knowledge-based and fair-minded, not a merely seat-of-the-pants ramble about nationalistic "greatness." The incorporation of international law or the "law of nations" into United States law is vital. This significant conclusion flows directly from Article 38 of the binding 1945 <em><a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">Statute of the International Court of Justice</a>.</em>

There is more. Under the always mutually reinforcing rules of national and international law–rules formally known as "peremptory" or "<em>jus cogens"</em> norms because they permit "no derogation"–an American president has no recognizable right to ignore or implicitly support egregious violations of human rights. This blanket prohibition obtains for fully any reason. It includes absolutely any supposed interest of geopolitics (e.g., Saudi Arabia represents a lesser evil than Iran) or of presumed economic advantage ("Thank you Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices").

Jurisprudentially, it all goes back to the beginnings of the American Republic. Among other still-relevant documents, the US <em><a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/">Declaration of Independence</a></em> codifies a social contract that sets limits on the authority of <em>any</em> government, especially on those primary matters concerning "natural" human rights. As justice, which for Americans is necessarily based on "natural law," commits <em>every</em> human society, the specific rights that are referenced, articulated and partially enumerated by the <em>Declaration of Independence </em>can never be reserved only to Americans.

Such rights, from the historical and documentary standpoint of the United States, are now and forever <em>universal. </em>They are never subject to modification or diminution by a sitting president. They may never be shelved on account of any current policies, especially such a grievously misconceived posture as "America First."

However much it remains unrecognized in the Trump White House, a jurisprudence based upon our Higher Law background is still very much in force for the United States. For Mr. Trump to glibly suggest otherwise, as he did recently regarding Saudi Arabia, and which he has done previously in regard to affirmations of US support for different law-violating regimes (e.g., the President’s refusal to condemn Russian and Syrian war crimes) is illogical and self-contradictory. Even discounting very specific “Magnitsky” prohibitions, any such suggestion undermines the immutable and universal jurisprudence from which the <em>Declaration</em> <em>of Independence</em> and <em>US Constitution</em> so plainly derive.

Distressingly few Americans are even aware of this basic US history and its corollary jurisprudence, but the pertinent facts and law remain valid nonetheless. For those readers who might like to look behind the news, however, the philosophical conveyance of natural law thinking into American Constitutional theory was largely the result of John Locke's <em><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm">Second Treatise on Civil Government</a>.</em> In 1776, a then future American president named Thomas Jefferson relied very heavily upon this <em>Treatise</em> to craft his <em>Declaration of Independence. </em>

Without Locke's specific intellectual example, the 18th century American cry for "self-determination" would have sounded very different.

In important matters of national legal obligation, history always deserves a conspicuous pride of place. While fellow seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes had regarded the natural law and national civil law as coextensive, Locke echoed a more than two thousand year tradition with a stirringly contrary view. This opposite view was that a country's domestic law must be kept scrupulously consistent with pre-existing natural law. Indeed, without such a mandatory consistency, any so-called domestic law was simply not fit to be called law.

It is not enough for an American president to justify any alleged ally's multiple crimes against human rights in terms of mutually gainful geopolitical goals. Accordingly, Mr. Trump should grasp and promptly reaffirm the most fundamental legal expectations of the United States. Regarding recent Saudi Arabian crimes, and assorted derelictions of other law-violating regimes, this president finally needs to understand an invariant and perpetual premise of American justice: <em>Respect for universal human rights is a long-codified legal obligation of the United States and should never be disregarded for narrowly personal or presumptively "nationalistic" benefit.</em>

For whatever reasons, President Donald Trump continues to think and act against the United States’, and his own, interests. Moreover, as is evident from America's established tradition of concern for worldwide human rights, such misconceived thinking undermines the most basic values and ideals of a nation long committed to "justice for all." While every country must continue to live with the corrosive legacy of fragmented international relations–a fearful inheritance originally bequeathed at the <span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Peace-of-Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a></span> in 1648–each state must inevitably acknowledge the interdependence of all states. Embracing such indispensable acknowledgment, each state–including the United States–could still navigate safely amid an historic anarchy.

Correspondingly, by standing together with a murderous regime in Riyadh, US President Donald Trump expressly rejected global interdependence and launched yet another incoherent salvo against global law and justice. It can never be proper or purposeful for any American president to stand in support of a regime that plainly slaughters a US-based newspaperman. Yet, it is precisely such a stand that Donald Trump's recent defense of Saudi Arabia's gangster-like killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi evidenced.

		<title>Massachusetts, A Leader in Transgender Human Rights Protections</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the recent voting, Massachusetts heartily defeated a referendum that would have rolled back state transgender protections. In 2004, Massachusetts was the first state to recognize marriage equality. Subsequently, the Commonwealth enacted legislation to advance protections for members of the LGBTQ community. In 2011, Massachusetts passed <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXI/Chapter151B">legislation</a> protecting those who identify as non-straight from discrimination in housing, employment, credit and public education. The legislation determined gender to “mean a person's gender-related identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth.”

The legislation was titled “An Act Relative to Gender Identity” and eliminated the notion that sex can be determined only by birth assignment. The 2011 legislation expanded evidence of gender to include broader factors in determining gender such as the individual’s “history and core identity as a person.” A natural extension of the 2011 legislation would include the use of bathrooms and locker rooms conforming to align with gender identity and in 2016, protections against discrimination were expanded to include public accommodations.

When the 2011 legislation passed, Massachusetts was not the first state to do so. And little controversy followed. Yet the simple expansion of rights under the 2016 act to include public accommodations was followed almost immediately with loud activity from those who demanded the repeal of the 2016 act. The opposition focused on the new provision providing transgender individuals the right to use their gender identified public restroom. Much of the controversy following <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2016/Chapter134">the act</a> may be credited to the legislation’s title "An Act Relative To Transgender Anti-Discrimination.” Would there have been as much controversy if the new provisions were part of an amendment to the 2011 legislation? Or perhaps then the call might have been to roll back all provisions of the 2011 protections. It may be worthy of study to determine the connection. Whether the delay in implementing the public accommodation terms was strategy or the result of political negotiation, we do not know. But the separation of the two bills is something for human rights advocates to consider when moving forward on proposed transgender legislation.

The movement to repeal the 2016 public accommodations protections was led by <a href="https://www.keepmasafe.org/">KeepMASafe.org</a>. Spokesperson, Andrew Beckwith, framed the opposition on keeping women and children safe. In adopting this theme, the organization avoided some criticism of enhancing discrimination and distracted voters with ungrounded safety issues. In pursuing this strategy, the organization KeepMASafe verified what most women already knew. Women are in danger primarily from heterosexual men. KeepMASafe’s website includes the following: “We think [the public accommodations bill is] bad for Massachusetts, particularly for the millions of women and children who are likely to be most affected by it,” by referencing a man who “in that moment” decides he is woman. This approach ignored the law’s specific term making illegal the use of gender for improper purposes.

One KeepMASafe ad showed a white man in a hoodie hiding in a women’s bathroom whose sole other occupant was a young female. The voiceover urges the public to repeal the transgender public accommodations bill that went “too far.” What the opposition unknowingly did was remind voters that the real danger of violence against women comes from men, not transgender women. This is a powerful argument for the protection of trans women who experience an elevated risk of violence.

Human Rights Watch<a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/a-national-epidemic-fatal-anti-transgender-violence-in-america-in-2018"> reported</a> that evidence based research shows that trans women are at much higher risk for gender violence than non-trans women. In 2017, at least, 29 transgender people were killed by violence. To date in 2018, 22 trans individuals have been killed by violence. Most trans women are killed by men. And most women are abused by men. Transwomen of color are at even higher risk, making up a disproportionate number of murdered transwomen. As reported by <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2018">Human Rights Watch</a>, in a <a href="https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF">2015 Transgender Survey</a>, 47% of respondents reported having been sexually assaulted and <a href="https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF">54%</a> reported being the targets of domestic violence. Men are the primary perpetrators of sexual assault and domestic violence.

Forcing transwomen to use the bathroom conforming with birth sex assignment places them at high risk of violence by men. Implicit in this legislation is the acknowledgment that the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which one identifies is a safety measure.

By contrast, the federal government is engaging in efforts to reverse trans people’s limited gains. This follows the administration's rollback of protections for the trans community. These include removing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">student rights</a> to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity and seeking to roll back trans individuals from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/trump-military-transgender/index.html">serving in the military</a>. Recognizing the discriminatory impact, several <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-trump-transgender-troops-ban-trial-20180416-story.html">federal judges</a> temporarily enjoined the President’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces. No national injunctions are in place regarding student rights.

The US is cutting back on human rights protections and the world is watching. The <a href="https://unfoundation.org/blog/post/transgender-rights-are-human-rights/">United Nations Foundation</a> noted the need for the US to protect all human rights. The United Nations blog stated: "[t]his discouraging news runs counter to American values and hurts the country's ability to champion human rights around the world. For the United States to be credible in advancing human rights and combating discrimination on the international stage, it needs to also set an example right at home."

Human rights advocates continue to work on local human rights issues. As was demonstrated in the recent Massachusetts’ vote, human rights advancements are more likely to be found on state and local levels. Lessons learned for advocates for trans people are that progress is often more attainable in states and municipalities than on the national level.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why was there so little support for Chief Justice Roberts in his exchange with President Trump? After the President attacked a recent decision by Federal District Judge Jon Tigar as having been rendered by an “Obama Judge,” Roberts responded to an inquiry by the AP with a short, but clear rebuke:
<blockquote>We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.<span> </span>What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.</blockquote>
Although couched in the language of judicial independence, Roberts’ deeper point was not about the need for such independence, but the <em>justification </em>for it.<span> </span>Unlike politicians, Roberts was claiming, Federal Judges do not act in a partisan fashion.<span> </span>Roberts was defending the rule of law.

That is why the tepid support for Roberts was shocking and demoralizing.<span> </span>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s response essentially agreed with President Trump.<span> </span>While lauding Roberts for defending “an independent judiciary,” Schumer criticized “partisan decisions” by Roberts and referred to him as a “Republican[],” which of course had been President Trump’s point—judicial decisions follow Party.

On the Right, there was even less support for the Chief Justice.<span> </span>Josh Blackman pointed out that Roberts’ response “will backfire,” since the President will always be able to have the last word—a prediction that was vindicated when President Trump later reiterated his attack on “Obama Judges.”<span> </span>

There was even a suggestion that President Trump was generally correct, even if not necessarily about Judge Tigar’s asylum ruling in particular.<span> </span>On the day of the Roberts’ statement, Randy Barnett, probably the Right’s intellectual leader in law, tweeted:
<blockquote>If you don’t think presidents of each party (try to) select judges with differing judicial philosophies, you haven’t been paying attention. Roosevelt surely did. And he wasn’t the first nor the last. The argumentation on this one is truly bizarre.</blockquote>
This is a dangerous position.<span> </span>It suggests there is no law, but only dueling judicial philosophies. But, there is then no reason to entrust any decisions to unelected judges.<span> </span>We would be better off letting politicians decide things.

The danger of this way of thinking can easily be seen in considering the very decision that prompted the Trump-Roberts exchange.<span> </span>Judge Tigar issued a temporary restraining against the Administration’s attempt to prevent aliens at the Mexican border from applying for asylum status except at ports of entry. The court ruled that this action violated the Immigration and Naturalization Act and, in the alternative, that there were “serious questions” whether the government had to comply with the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act before it could proceed.<span> </span>Whatever one thinks of Judge Tigar’s ruling, there was nothing obviously ideological about it.

In fact, Judge Tigar’s ruling is reminiscent of another ruling issued last February by Senior Federal District Judge Sam Cummings, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, that a criminal history “guidance document” issued during the Obama Administration by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was unenforceable because it was a disguised regulation issued without complying with the notice-and-comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.<span> </span>John-Michael Seibler of The Heritage Foundation praised that decision as vindicating the “<a href="https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/court-ruling-rebukes-obama-era-practice-flouted-rule-law">Rule of Law</a>.” Are we really ready to surrender this core component of the Western constitutional tradition?<span>  </span>

I am afraid the answer not only is yes, we are, but that we have already given it up.<span> </span>Consider the words of, and the response to, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the 2018 Federalist Society National Lawyers Convention on November 15:
<blockquote>The closest thing we can do to have a permanent impact is to confirm judges and transform the judiciary. [A]nd we are going to keep on doing it for as long as we can. (<a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMBlackman/status/1063269631757029376">Standing Ovation</a>)</blockquote>
That is a campaign speech, not a plea for the rule of law.<span> </span>A “permanent impact” is not a method, like originalism.<span> </span>It refers to a preset series of outcomes, like protecting religious believers or providing anonymity to large corporate political donations or returning to the <em>Lochner </em>decision.<span>  </span>

Reportedly, Justice John Marshall Harlan II was not certain how he would vote on the jacket in <em>Cohen v. California</em>.<span> </span>Thus, President Eisenhauer apparently did not have the kind of permanent impact in appointing Harlan that McConnell has in mind.<span>  </span>

There is a reason that only judicial outcomes now matter.<span> </span>The original criticism of <em>Roe v. Wade </em>was that it was not law.<span> </span>And this criticism was enunciated by both the Right and the Left, by both Robert Bork and John Ely.<span> </span>But that very criticism requires a commitment to moral realism.<span> </span>Or, if you prefer a less loaded term, a commitment to essentialism. We have to be able to say what law is and is not.<span>  </span>

As C.S. Lewis would point out, however, a lot comes along with that commitment, including a willingness to say what a human being is and what the universe is like.

We have now lost that commitment.<span> </span>As the most articulate Justice of the post-WWII era, Justice Antonin Scalia enunciated the current values skepticism of both the Left and the Right.<span> </span>He was unwilling to say in <em>Casey </em>that the Constitution would prohibit forced abortion by the State because it would be morally monstrous.<span> </span>He hid behind “tradition” instead.<span> </span>And in the <em>McDonald </em>gun-right-incorporation case, Justice Scalia claimed that nothing objective could be said about “what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled life” because “political, moral judgments” are subjective.

The great conservative theorist Harry Jaffa warned years ago that this kind of skepticism is incompatible with the rule of law.<span> </span>Our unwillingness to come to the defense of Chief Justice Roberts shows he was right.<span> </span>

The question now becomes, can a commitment to Truth be reintroduced in American law schools, and how, and when? <span>   </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the midterm elections, it is worth considering how we might change our founding document, the U.S constitution, and update it so that it reflects the times we live in. One glaring example of a needed update is the Electoral College.

Actually, I should say “eliminate” instead of “update”. Specifically, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a>, Section 1, Clause 3 should be deleted and replaced by an amendment which provides for a direct, popular election for president in the same way we <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvii">elect U.S. Senators</a>.

In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million, but Trump was elected because of this anachronistic relic of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Actually, Democrats have been calling for changing the way we vote for president at least since 2000, when Al Gore garnered 500,000 more votes nationally than George Bush, but Bush became our President when the Supreme Court famously stopped the vote-count in Florida.

"No society can make a perpetual constitution," Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison in 1789, the year ours took effect. "The earth belongs always to the living generation and not to the dead. . .. Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years." By that calculation, we're more than two centuries behind schedule for a long, hard look at our most sacred of cows. And what it reveals isn't pretty. The one we have practically guarantees gridlock and is almost impossible to change.<span> The US Constitution is more a relic of the 18th century than a workable plan for government in the 21st.</span>

Six years ago, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg <span>said in a television interview in Egypt that “I would not look to the United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012.” Ginsburg urged Egyptians instead to emulate more recent legal documents, which allow amendments to be added more frequently, including the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/constitution/SAConstitution-web-eng.pdf">Constitution of South Africa</a> (1997), the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> (1982) and the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (1950). The United States is an outlier in this regard.</span>

<span>Furthermore, a <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=1923556">study</a> conducted by David Law, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, concluded that our Constitution’s global appeal has diminished markedly over the past half century. Fewer and fewer nations are modeling their own constitutions on the American version.</span>

The familiar part of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlev">Article V of the Constitution</a> states that Congress, with the two-thirds approval of both the House and the Senate, can propose amendments to the Constitution, subject to ratification by three-fourths of the states. But there is a second path: “on the application of the legislatures” of two-thirds of the states, Congress “<strong>shall </strong>call a convention for proposing amendments,” the amendments being subject to ratification by three-fourths of the states.

A convention called by the states for the purpose of altering the Constitution has never taken place. Not even once. And there is an excellent reason for that: The founders put up great barriers to using it. As the journalist Daniel Lazare has <a href="https://daniellazare.com/2013/06/16/sovereignty-and-the-constitution/">observed</a>, “Moments after establishing the people as the omnipotent makers and breakers of constitutions, [the 1787 US Constitution] announced that. . .[c]hanging so much as a comma in the Constitution would require the approval of two-thirds of each house of Congress plus three-fourths of the states. . .. The people did not assert their sovereignty in Philadelphia in 1787. Rather, the founders invoked it. Once they uttered the magic incantation, moreover, they hastened to put the genie back in the bottle by declaring the people all but powerless to alter their own plan of government.”

What is more, there is no set of instructions for “a convention for proposing amendments,” in the sparse language of Article V.

What could go wrong in an Article V convention? The honest answer is everything. The scariest prospect is for a “runaway convention.” Still, as historian Paul Starobin has<a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/05/whos-afraid-of-an-article-v-convention/"> suggested</a>, “Our political times are raucous, but to wait for tranquility for a convention is to wait possibly forever; it should be recalled that the delegates in Philadelphia gathered in an atmosphere of crisis, amid angst that the republic could not survive under the Articles of Confederation. . .So while there is a risk to a convention under Article V, there also is an appreciable risk in doing nothing, of leaving the political situation to fester as it is.” What is more, should that happen, the finished product would have to be approved by the legislatures of 38 of the 50 states.

Constitutional scholars who have studied the issue say there are two types of constitutional conventions that can be called: general and limited.
<ul>
 	<li>The general convention would be free to consider any and all additions to the Constitution, as well as alterations to existing constitutional provisions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>The limited convention would be restricted by its call to authorizing legislation to consideration of a single issue or group of issues, as specified by the states in their applications</li>
</ul>
<span>Put another way, </span>conventions can be open and general, or limited, depending on the applications of the legislatures.

The most <a href="https://conventionofstates.com/">prominent group</a> calling for an Article V convention today are self-identified as conservatives who go by the name of the “Convention of States.” The organization is calling for a limited convention for the purpose of imposing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting its power and jurisdiction, and imposing term limits on its officials and members of Congress. But they set up no rules governing the convention’s proceedings, making the likelihood of a runaway convention real.

Its cause <em>de jour</em> is passing a balanced budget constitutional amendment. The group is now six states short of reaching the constitutionally-required 34 applications to convene a balanced budget constitutional convention. In response, liberal groups, many law professors, judges, and newspapers have issued a call to prevent such a convention. Their objections are best <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article218141540.html">summarized</a> by Allen Rostron, a constitutional law scholar at University of Missouri Law School:

“Whatever one thinks about these proposed amendments, trying to pass them through an Article V convention is a risky business. The Constitution does not specify how the delegates for such a convention would be chosen, how many delegates each state would have, what rules would apply at the convention or whether there would be any limits on what amendments the convention could consider. A convention that was called to address a specific issue, such as budget deficits, might propose changes to freedom of speech, the right to keep and bear arms, the Electoral College or anything else in the Constitution. There is no rule or precedent saying what the proper scope of the convention’s work would be.”

But suppose the rules for calling a convention were established beforehand and had to be strictly adhered to. If this were the case, a progressive call for a constitutional convention might look like this:
<ol>
 	<li>Call would be for a general convention</li>
 	<li>535 delegates, the total number of House and Senate seats</li>
 	<li>Delegates chosen by election or by the state legislature</li>
 	<li>Each state assigned the same number of delegates as it has in the House of Representatives, to comply with “one person, one vote” requirement.</li>
 	<li>two-thirds supermajority required to pass an amendment</li>
 	<li>Delegates must include members of 3<sup>rd</sup> parties and independents</li>
 	<li>Protection for Bill of Rights guaranteed (except, possibly, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment by limiting the right to bear arms to those serving in a militia.)</li>
</ol>
Yes, because the rules are established in advance, it will be very difficult to reach the 34 state threshold. But Article V sets no time limit to gain the 34 states required.

As for the issues progressives might want to consider, there are many: overturn <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6233137937069871624&amp;q=citizens+united+v+federal+election+com%27n&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,39">Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission</a></em>; eliminate the Electoral College and replace it with popular vote for President; expand the number of House members; establish regular and periodical Article V conventions, perhaps every 25 years; establish a federal right to vote; establish a federal privacy right; create an affirmative right to food, healthcare, and shelter; mandate non-partisan redistricting for the House of Representatives; establish 25-year terms for the US Supreme Court; eliminate or reign in the filibuster in the Senate; adopt the equal rights amendment; amend Article V by reducing the ratification threshold from ¾ to two-thirds of the states.

The last suggestion would make the process of amending the constitution easier. That would align the country with other western democracies such as Germany and France.

Note that I have not mentioned the undemocratic Senate. (Wyoming, with a population of 600,000, has the same number of Senators as California, whose population is 40 million.) The barrier to fixing the Senate is the last phrase in Article V which reads that “no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal representation in the Senate.” Theoretically, a constitutional convention could vote to (1) delete the phrase and eliminate the body or (2) somehow reduce its power. However, there is almost no chance a supermajority of the states would agree to such a change.

University of Texas Constitutional Law Professor Sanford Levinson may have <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/It-Is-Time-to-Repair-the/10234">said it best</a>:

“We must recognize that substantial responsibility for the defects of our polity lies in the Constitution itself. A number of wrong turns were taken at the time of the initial drafting of the Constitution, even if for the best of reasons given the political realities of 1787. . .If I am correct that the Constitution is both insufficiently democratic, in a country that professes to believe in democracy, and significantly dysfunctional, in terms of the quality of government that we receive, then it follows that we should no longer express our blind devotion to it.”

Blind devotion to the Constitution must end. It should not be viewed in sacred terms. We must begin to think of it as a fallible legal document that should be periodically updated with the times.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 8, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit became the first appellate court to enter one of the most high-profile legal fights against the Trump Administration.  In lead and concurring opinions running 99 pages, three appellate judges in <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2018/11/08/18-15068%20Opinion.pdf"><em>Regents of the University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</em></a> affirmed a district court’s <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2017cv05211/316722/239/0.pdf?ts=1517246193">preliminary injunction</a> requiring the Administration to keep the Obama-era <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/archive/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) program in place pending further proceedings.

The 2012 DACA program has granted renewable two-year deferrals from deportation to almost 700,000 “dreamers” brought illegally to America as children, and who have clean criminal records and meet educational or military service requirements. Successful DACA applicants can also apply for authorization to work legally.

The Ninth Circuit’s <em>Regents</em> decision increases the likelihood that the U.S. Supreme Court will enter the fray. Before the Ninth Circuit ruled, the Trump Administration had already taken the unusual step of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1003/28381/20180119100226711_DACA%20Rule%2011%20Petition.pdf">asking the Supreme Court</a> to not await court-of-appeals rulings and undertake direct review of adverse district-court rulings in Northern California, Brooklyn, New York, and the District of Columbia. Now that <em>Regents</em> can be the vehicle for reviewing the DACA rescission without jumping the usual judicial line, some Court watchers are speculating that the justices could quickly grant certiorari, schedule oral argument for April, and decide DACA’s fate by the end of its current term in mid-summer.

For now, let’s look beyond whether <em>Regents</em> will lead to one of the biggest cases in this Supreme Court term and the first major test of how new Justice Kavanaugh will resolve challenges to actions by the President who appointed him. <em>Regents</em> is important for four other reasons explained in the remainder of this commentary.

<strong>How Litigation Narrows and Skews the Issues</strong>

First, <em>Regents</em> provides a prominent new example of a point I’ve highlighted in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/tag/author-glenn-smith/">previous JURIST writings</a>: when a challenged governmental policy ends up being litigated, the issues can be much narrower than and different from how the controversy plays out in the political branches, the media, and the public.

Ask any informed American about the issues raised by the dreamers and DACA and they’d likely focus on the equities of deporting productive and often exemplary young people to countries they have no connection to and the economic and social implications of illegal immigration. Informed Americans might especially raise concerns resonating with U.S. constitutional rights – including the due-process right not to be targeted for deportation based on information the dreamers voluntarily provided to DACA decision-makers or the equal-protection guarantee not to be discriminated against based on ethnicity or nationality.

Thus, it would likely surprise even many well-informed observers to know that, like the district judge whose decision was under their review, the two appellate judges forming the lead <em>Regents</em> opinion (I’ll dub them “the <em>Regents</em> duo”) relied on arcane administrative-law doctrines flowing from the judicial-review provisions of the Federal Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, the <em>Regents</em> duo concluded that Acting DHS Secretary Nielsen’s September 5, 2017 <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca">announcement rescinding DACA</a> would ultimately be found illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” administrative action violating <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/706">5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A)</a>.

(The third Ninth Circuit judge relied instead on the likelihood that rescission opponents could show an equal-protection violation, based on the disproportionate impact on certain ethnic minorities and President Trump’s anti-Mexican statements as a candidate and once in office.)

<strong>How an APA Theory Channels Analysis</strong>

A second reason why <em>Regents</em> is important is that it nicely illustrates how reliance on an APA arbitrary-and-capricious-action theory directs the legal analysis. Relying on the APA required the <em>Regents</em> duo to decide what they termed the “pivotal” threshold question — whether the DACA rescission was reviewable by any court.

In a lengthy and highly detailed exploration of whether the DHS action was so thoroughly “committed to agency discretion” (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/701">5 U.S.C. Sec. 701(a)2</a>) that there was no law to apply, the <em>Regents</em> duo dissected Supreme and lower court precedents and parsed the factual record to arrive at two main conclusions: 1, Courts may review an administrative decision not to enforce current policy if the decision is “based solely on” the agency’s “belief that it lacked jurisdiction to act.” And 2, the DHS action was in fact solely based on a Department of Justice memorandum opining that DACA should be rescinded because it was “effectuated…without proper statutory authority” and “was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.”

(Significantly, the third Ninth Circuit judge who voted with colleagues to keep the DACA rescission on hold found the duo’s treatment of APA reviewability unpersuasive. DHS acted, in this judge’s view, “with broad discretion that courts cannot review absent clear congressional authorization.”)

Finding the DACA rescission reviewable because it relied solely on the Justice Department’s anti-DACA assessment, the <em>Regents</em> duo then needed to judge the merits of the rationale on which the assessment relied. The <em>Regents</em> duo found that DACA fit comfortably within a past history of immigration-enforcement discretion by previous administrations, which adopted deferred action programs for “entire classes of otherwise removable citizens.” The judges also considered, and rejected, several Trump Administration arguments that DACA suffered from the same legal deficiencies that had led two lower courts and an equally divided Supreme Court to prevent DAPA (a later program to benefit the noncitizen parents of DACA recipients) from ever going into effect.

Thus, in going down the administrative-law road, the <em>Regents</em> duo bypassed direct consideration of constitutional arguments (although, like the district judge they affirmed, the appellate judges saved plaintiffs’ claims from dismissal, and they can be taken up later as needed). Instead, the <em>Regents</em> duo emphasized APA reviewability and rationality, which definitely switched the narrative and analytical focus.

<strong>The Potency and Limits of APA-based Challenges</strong>

This leads to a third, related point: The <em>Regents </em>litigation illustrates the potential potency of administrative law doctrines as weapons against a new administration’s enforcement-policy changes, but <em>Regents</em> also points to the inherent limitations of this strategy.

As to potency, there is the simple reality that the APA-challenge strategy has successfully scuttled DACA rescission for more than a year. (Even if a mid-summer Supreme Court reversal of <em>Regents</em> clears the way for DACA rescission, that would be an almost two-year delay.)

On the limitations side, APA-based arbitrary-and-capricious invalidations are unlike judicial rejections on constitutional or statutory grounds. The latter last until the Constitution is changed or a precedent is overturned – unlikely – or until Congress re-legislates – also unlikely, when the policy question is controversial! By contrast, APA deficiencies can be more quickly cured by the administrative agency itself.  As the <em>Regents</em> panel itself recognized, the Administration “is, as always, free to reexamine its policy choices” and rescind DACA on some discretionary basis other than “an erroneous view of what the law required.”

<strong>The Broader Looming Questions</strong>

A fourth and final observation is that <em>Regents</em> and the broader DACA-rescission litigation pose especially difficult versions of questions typically looming behind the seemingly obscure administrative-law doctrines.

Judicial review of the substantive justification behind agency action always raises basic institutional concerns about the legitimacy of unelected, non-expert judges second-guessing more democratically accountable, presumably expert officials.  But when the focus of review is a high-profile policy decision prominently discussed in a presidential campaign and after, the legitimacy concerns are heightened.

The DACA dispute also raises the vexing institutional question of whether courts are on a firmer, as strong, or less solid footing when they question the <em>legal</em> <em>reasoning</em> of an administration’s chief law-enforcement officer (the Attorney General). On the one hand, courts have more claim to expertise in legal reasoning than in the myriad technical and policy implications arising in regulation. On the other hand, shifting legal theories are one of the key ways in which new administrations correct errors and effect the changes they are supposedly elected to accomplish. One example is the Obama Administration’s 2011 about-face on the constitutionality of the same-sex marriage restrictions in the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

Ultimately, then, <em>Regents</em> and the DACA-rescission controversy raise fundamental questions about the extent to which regulatory-policy continuity — and, specifically, stability in the legal theory behind regulation — is an important dimension of the rule of law.

It will be interesting to see the extent to which these difficult but important mega-questions are addressed, explicitly or implicitly, in future rounds of the fight over DACA.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a referendum held on Friday, October 26, 2018, the people of Ireland <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/ireland-votes-to-remove-blasphemy-from-constitution/"><span>voted</span> to amend</a> the Irish Constitution to remove the word blasphemy from <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en#article40_6_1">Article 40.6.1</a></span>, which declared that "[t]he publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law." This constitutional amendment enables the <span>Oireachtas</span>, Ireland’s National Parliament, to change statutory law so that blasphemy is no longer a crime. It also represents the most recent advance in this predominantly Catholic country toward a more secular society. <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/ca/34/enacted/en/html">Same-sex marriage</a></span> and <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152">abortion</a></span> were legalized in two earlier referenda. And it might constitute an important step in undoing some of the unintentional international consequences of Ireland’s criminalization of blasphemy.

Ireland's blasphemy ban was enshrined in the constitution in 1937, during an era when church and state were seen as a single entity and defaming the established religion was tantamount to treason. Corresponding definitions and penalties were enacted in the <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/html">2009 Defamation Act</a></span>. In contrast to <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en#article40_6_1">Article 40.6.1</a></span> of the constitution, which had protected only Christians from blasphemy—the 2009 Act was designed to protect all religions.  The Act defined blasphemy as “publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion, thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents of that religion, with some defenses permitted.” However, it was widely believed that the Act did no more than give lip service to the constitutional requirement that blasphemy be declared a crime because, on any fair reading, the statutory provision was unenforceable.

This unenforceability did not prevent Irish police from investigating whether British comedian Stephen Fry had broken the law in 2015 when he described God as “capricious, mean-minded, stupid” and “an utter maniac” on an Irish television program. The case was closed when police admitted they were unable to find a substantial number of people who had been offended by Frye’s televised statements. Shortly thereafter, an alliance of religious groups—including the Catholic Church—declared the constitutional clause “largely obsolete.”

In this case, however, the issue is more far-reaching than Ireland’s archaic constitutional relic and its inexorable march toward secularization. The amendment sends a message to countries with repressive blasphemy laws that have encouraged extremists while failing to address religious intolerance. This message is long overdue and not without irony. It was Ireland’s 2009 Defamation Act that inspired Pakistan’s successful attempt, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to <span>persuade the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the </span><span><a href="https://undocs.org/A/HRC/RES/13/16">“defamation of religion” as a human rights violation</a></span><span>. In fact, in </span>calling for <span>the </span>UN to adopt a global principle against defamation that equated criticism of Islam with incitement to religious hatred,<span> the OIC </span>borrowed verbatim the text of Ireland’s legislation. The ensuing 2010 UN <span><a href="https://undocs.org/A/HRC/RES/13/16">Defamation of Religion resolution</a></span> declared that “vilification of religions is a serious affront to human dignity leading to the illicit restriction of the freedom of religion of their adherents and incitement to religious hatred and violence” and called on states to enact measures that would “prohibit the advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence ….”

Opponents of this resolution have argued that it protects groups, ideas, and beliefs over individual human rights, which in turn threatens the individual right to freedom of expression. This and similar UN resolutions have provided international legitimacy for domestic blasphemy laws that are used to suppress religious minorities and silence dissenters, resulting in human rights violations.

In Pakistan, for example, the punishment for blasphemy is death. One extreme but not isolated example is the 2010 case of Asia Bibi, a Christian wife and mother who was sentenced to death for defaming the prophet Muhammad. The case of Asia Bibi, whose full name is Asia Noreen, has followed the trajectory of Ireland’s <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/html">2009 Defamation Act</a></span>. On a hot day, after bringing water to a group of Muslim women harvesting fruit, she found the group enraged when she took a sip of water from a cup. The women argued that because she had used the cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. In the ensuing disagreement, Asia Bibi refused their demands that she convert to Islam, whereupon the women reported to prosecutors that she had insulted the prophet Muhammad. After a local mob beat her in front of her children, Bibi was arrested and charged under <span><a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html#f108">section 295C</a></span> of the <span><a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html">Pakistan Penal Code</a></span> and in 2010 was sentenced to death by hanging. This decision was upheld by the Lahore High Court in 2014, but her <span><a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/1691760/1-cjp-hear-aasia-bibis-case/">execution was stayed</a></span> following an appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan.  In a 56-page opinion rendered on October 31, 2018, only a few days after the Irish referendum, the Supreme Court <span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/10/pakistan-supreme-court-overturns-catholic-womans-blasphemy-conviction-and-death-sentence/">acquitted</a></span> Asia Bibi on the ground that her accusers had not conclusively proved her guilt. While hailed by human rights groups, this decision merely fanned the flames of protest and increased calls for her execution. On November 2, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a> signed an <span><a href="https://www.upi.com/Pakistan-bars-Bibi-from-leaving-amid-acquittal-protests/6241541270833/">agreement</a></span> with the extremist political party that was leading the protests. This agreement barred Asia Bibi from leaving Pakistan until the verdict has been reviewed, a process that can take years. She remained in prison until November 7, 2018 and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/11/30/asia-bibi-in-hiding-after-blasphemy-acquittal-is-banned-from-leaving-pakistan/">remains in hiding</a> in a government safe-house, pending review of her verdict.

Asia Bibi was not the only victim in this case. In January 2011, Salmaan Taseer, a secular governor of Punjab, was killed by his bodyguard for denouncing her treatment. Two months later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the federal Minister for Minority Affairs and Pakistan’s only Christian government minister, was gunned down outside his home for urging reform to the country’s blasphemy laws. And when hard-liners appealed Asia Bibi’s acquittal, her lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook fled Pakistan after receiving death threats.

While individual Irish citizens had their own reasons for voting to remove the word blasphemy from the constitution, the Irish government has favored a referendum because of the law’s influence on Pakistan. In 2010, Dermot Ahern, the Irish Justice Minister proposed a constitutional referendum, stating that “[T]his law is . . . dangerous because it incentives religious outrage and because its wording has already been adopted by Islamic States as part of their campaign to make blasphemy a crime internationally.”

When the <span><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/convention-recommends-replacing-blasphemy-offence-1.1582317">Irish Constitutional Convention</a></span> discussed the constitutional offense of blasphemy in 2013, opponents argued vehemently for abolition, pointing out that its very existence linked Ireland to oppressive blasphemy laws in countries like Pakistan.

Ireland is not the only country to condemn Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. On December 22, 2017, in accordance with the <span><a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/2297.pdf">International Religious Freedom Act of 1998</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ281/PLAW-114publ281.pdf">as amended</a></span>, the U.S. Secretary of State placed Pakistan on a <span><a href="https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2017/sca/281032.htm">Special Watch List</a></span> for having engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom. The <span><a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/281276.pdf">State Department reported</a></span> Pakistan’s continuing practice of bringing blasphemy complaints to intimidate neighbors, peers, or business associates or to settle personal grievances, with the police and courts occasionally complicit in this practice. Efforts to protect people from unfounded accusations of blasphemy have largely failed. Despite a <span><a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1351121">directive from the Islamabad High Court</a></span>, Pakistan’s Parliament took no action to amend the Penal Code to align the penalties for false accusations of blasphemy with those for committing blasphemy.

Ireland’s outdated blasphemy ban was indefensible in a modern, democratic republic premised on separation of church and state. It also posed numerous problems, many of which affect Pakistan as well. First, the ban constrained freedom of religious expression by placing unnecessary restrictions on content and by subjecting discrete views to state-sanctioned interpretations of religious truth. The faiths and belief systems of individuals can better be protected through incitement to hatred laws, such as Ireland’s <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1989/act/19/enacted/en/html">Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989</a></span>. Third, the vague wording of the <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en#article40_6_1">constitutional ban</a></span> and <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/html">interpretive statute</a></span> failed to provide the specificity that people require in order to regulate their conduct. This opened the <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/html">Act</a></span> up to inconsistent interpretations and discriminatory enforcement. Finally, the law had an adverse international impact, as demonstrated by Pakistan’s documented human rights violations following its verbatim adoption of Ireland’s <span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/31/enacted/en/html">2009 Defamation Act</a></span>.

The long-term solution is to reform – if not repeal – Pakistan’s blasphemy law. As repeal is unlikely, Pakistan should strive to eliminate the death penalty for blasphemy, enact a law that protects religious minorities and provides a defense of freedom of expression, and legislate penalties for false accusations of blasphemy commensurate with those for committing blasphemy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last 3 years, the Hungarian Government, especially with its support from the recently obtained 2/3 majority in the Parliament, has introduced several legislative changes which seriously undermine the essential elements of the rule of law. <a href="https://www.helsinki.hu/wp-content/uploads/T333-ENG.pdf">Criminalization of “facilitating or supporting illegal immigration”</a>, <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/irom41/00332/00332-0011.pdf">banning homelessness</a> and the Government’s continuing interference in the higher education are just the major issues. Some of the mentioned legal changes were problematic not only on the substantial grounds, but also in regard to the procedure – they were passed promptly and without any public debate. This process triggered the discontent of Hungarian civil society and the international community. In the previous three weeks, a big student protest has taken place in front of the Hungarian Parliament. Students were supported by their teachers and eminent international scholars who joined them and gave lectures as a contribution to the “fight for academic freedom”. What’s wrong with the academic freedom in Hungary, and are there any legal protections within the Hungarian Fundamental law? Although Hungary has been a great inspiration for legal analysis these days, I will focus on the legal effects of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Opinion/Legislation/OLHungaryCEU.pdf">amendments to the Act CCIV of 2011 On National Higher Education</a> introduced in 2017 and the recent Government’s decree which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-government-education/hungary-to-stop-financing-gender-studies-courses-pm-aide-idUSKBN1KZ1M0">removed the gender studies</a> from Hungarian accredited master’s programs.

In April 2017, Hungarian Parliament <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/irom40/14686/14686.pdf">passed the law</a> which regulates the status of foreign universities operating in Hungary and modifies the National Higher Education law. This law (in media referred to as Lex CEU) was passed under exceptional procedure which is provided by the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+RULES-EP+20100705+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN">article 61 of the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure</a>. The Government claimed that the exceptional procedure was justified because there was the urgent need for the regulation in this area. The Government didn’t show any clear evidence of this necessity. Although the relevant provisions regulate the status of all foreign universities operating in Hungary, new conditions posed by this law seemed to affect only one particular University (Central European University). <a href="https://www.ceu.edu/">Central European University</a> is an American private higher educational institution which is both Hungarian and U.S.-accredited and it has been operating according to Hungarian law for more than 25 years. It was clear that CEU could not meet the requirements proposed by the law of 2017 before it would come into force (for example, that the institution has to provide education in the country of origin or that there has to be an agreement between Hungary and the country in which the University is accredited). The law was supposed to come into force 6 months after it was passed, but then the Government extended this deadline until 2019. During this period, CEU has taken all the necessary measures and managed to meet the criteria set by the lex CEU. The only thing left to be done is signing of the agreement between Hungary and the State of New York, in which the CEU is accredited. Hungary has remained silent on this and 2019 is approaching. On December 1, 2018 the deadline proposed by the CEU for signing the agreement passed and the university will be forced to move its operations to another country. Why is it so crucial for this university to stay in a Central European country? CEU is a highly reputable educational institution which provides its students with the knowledge necessary for building an open society that respects and promotes human rights. Lex CEU raised a major debate in Europe and it was addressed as dangerous to the rule of law even by the Venice Commission and European Commission. Another attack on academic freedom was the Government’s decree issued last month, which removed gender studies from Hungarian accredited programs. This legal act affected CEU but one public Hungarian university as well (<a href="https://www.elte.hu/en/">ELTE University</a>). The Government’s justification for such a measure was that “gender studies are ideology, and not science” and therefore, the state shouldn’t fund that program. Does the Government have the right to make such a decision, in the light of international and Hungarian constitutional law?

Academic freedom as such isn’t protected under <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> but the ECHR referred to it several times in its case-law under Article 10 (freedom of expression). According to the Venice Commission “…it seems obvious that, as a key pre-requirement for the effective enjoyment of the freedom of expression, States should refrain from undue interference with the university teaching and the freedom of organizing teaching and research.” Another important international instrument which protects the principle of academic freedom is <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">The International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights</a> (ICESCR), which in Article 13 guarantees academic freedom and institutional autonomy. Academic freedom is indispensable for the exercise of the freedom of expression, association and the right to education. This being said, the question is – how to protect it within a national jurisdiction.

Article 10 clause 1 of the <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/e/02/00000/The%20New%20Fundamental%20Law%20of%20Hungary.pdf">Hungarian Fundamental Law</a> states that “Hungary shall ensure the freedom of scientific research and artistic creation, the freedom of learning for the acquisition of the highest possible level of knowledge...” What does this provision actually mean in real life? Can it be protected before the Constitutional court or is it only declaratory in nature? Lex CEU was brought to the Hungarian Constitutional court in the procedure upon a constitutional complaint, but the Court remained silent (it decided to postpone the procedure by its decision of 5 June 2018). The other two clauses of Article 10 can be brought into question as well because they prescribe that “<em>The State shall have no right to decide on questions of scientific truth; only scientists shall have the right to evaluate scientific research</em>” and also that “…<em>Higher education institutions shall be autonomous in terms of the content and the methods of research and teaching; their organization shall be regulated by an Act. The Government shall, within the framework of an Act, lay down the rules governing the management of public higher education institutions and shall supervise their management</em>.” The latter provision clearly shows that public universities aren’t autonomous institutions. Claiming that gender studies are ideology and not science amounts to the Government's interference with the methods of research and teaching. The last part of the provision under Article 10 gives the Government a broad power to regulate in this sphere under the right to “govern the management of public higher education institutions”.  The serious problem is that the Government didn’t give any other justification for its decision to ban gender studies except that the State wouldn’t fund it because it is ideology and because “<em>the Hungarian government is of the clear view that people are born either men or women</em>” (statement of Prime Minister’s chief of staff in August 2018). In addition, the Government stated that gender studies graduates cannot be successful in the job market. If the Government can decide which programs it will or will not fund, what will be the limit? Some time in the future, literature or philosophy studies could be banned as well, because that might not be science or profitable according to the Government.

If the Government can say what the science is, and the 2/3 majority in Parliament can say what the law is, what will happen with the academic and other freedoms in Hungary?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since its enactment in 2010, the <span><a href="Despite%20popular%20support%20for%20the%20ACA,%20the%20federal%20administration%20may%20use%20the%20Texas%20decision%20as%20grounds%20for%20invalidating,%20ignoring,%20or%20obviating%20enforcement%20of%20the%20ACA%20in%202019.">Affordable Care Act</a></span> (ACA) has provided meaningful coverage for millions of Americans, reformed the national health insurance and health care delivery infrastructure, and assured basic public health services through core funding.

Enforcing the ACA has also entailed a multitude of political and legal challenges including (1) dozens of <span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/other/352587-timeline-the-gop-effort-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare">failed attempts</a></span> by Congress to repeal its provisions, (2) multiple <span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-hhs-cms-regulations-obamacare-aca-healthcare-waivers-2018-10">federal regulatory waivers</a></span>, and (3) considerable judicial adjustments.

On December 14, 2018, the torrid history of the ACA added its newest chapter. In a federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, Judge Reed O’Connor ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. The decision in <span><em><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/211-texas-order-granting-plaintiffs-partial-summary-judgment.pdf">Texas v. United States</a></em></span>, has been anticipated for months following oral arguments. If upheld on appeal, it could spell the end of every protection, program, subsidy, and incentive framed in the ACA not otherwise waived or dismantled by prior or current administrations.

This commentary explains the core premises for the court’s decision, disputes its legal foundations, and assesses future law and policy options for courts, Congress, and Americans facing the loss of popular ACA protections and benefits.

<strong>Legal Developments Leading to the Court’s Decision</strong>

The primary impetus for the court’s decision arose just under a year ago. After a series of legislative failures to repeal the ACA, including the indelible “<span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/08/27/iconic-thumbs-down-vote-that-summed-up-john-mccains-career/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c6215e05aca6">thumbs down” vote</a></span> of the late Senator John McCain, R-AZ in July 2017, Congress turned its attention to tax reform. It enacted massive changes via the <span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a></span> (TCJA) through its budget reconciliation process. TCJA was subsequently <span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-sweeping-tax-overhaul-into-law-1513959753">signed</a></span> by President Trump on December 22, 2017.

The inherent confines of the budget process bootstrapped Congress’ ability to amend substantive provisions of the ACA. However, TCJA included a <span><a href="http://www.healthreformtracker.org/tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-executive-summary/#Repeal">core provision</a></span> that eliminated the taxable amount charged to Americans who failed to acquire health insurance pursuant to the ACA’s individual mandate.

The U.S. Supreme Court determined in <span><em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/567/519/">NFIB v. Sebelius</a></em></span> (2012) that the individual mandate was a lawful exercise of Congress’ power to tax, but not regulate interstate commerce. The Court emphasized that the penalty imposed via the individual mandate could be viewed as a tax, in part, because it generated some revenue for the federal Treasury.

Congress’ withdrawal of monetary charges through TCJA for ACA’s individual mandate led <span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/375760-20-states-file-lawsuit-alleging-obamacare-is-unconstitutional">Texas and nineteen other states</a></span> to challenge the continued enforcement of ACA on multiple grounds, including a claim that the zeroing out of charges voided the individual mandate. Absent the collection of any revenue, so the argument goes, the tax authority underlying the individual mandate is negated. Because the individual mandate was so essential to the ACA, the entire act must be unconstitutional. It is a specious conclusion under existing constitutional theory, but the court bought it nevertheless.

<strong>The Heart of the Court’s Analyses</strong>

Judge Reed O’Connor’s decision invalidating the entire ACA relies on an obtuse application of principles of severability embedded within separation of powers.

The <span><a href="https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-101-issue-5/beyond-severability/">legal concept of severability</a></span> is straightforward. To the extent a court determines that a provision of a legislative act is infirm, the remainder of the act is presumed to remain intact.  Only in narrow circumstances should a court’s finding that a statutory provision is unconstitutional work to nullify the entire act. Respect for the distinct functions of the legislative and judicial branches to create and interpret the law, respectively, sustains limited applications of severability.

In <em>Texas</em>, voiding the individual mandate should not mean the entire ACA is torpedoed. Judge O’Connor contrives this result through an overzealous assessment of Congress’ intent underlying the ACA. With <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-wont-defend-aca-in-cases-brought-by-gop-states/2018/06/07/92f56e86-6a9c-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?utm_term=.e069bb5565b5">no resistance from the federal Department of Justice</a></span> (which refused to defend the issue), the court reasons that the individual mandate was rendered unconstitutional when Congress withdrew its monetary benefits. This finding alone is challengeable. Just because Congress later amends an exercise of its tax power does not make the original practice unconstitutional. As the court notes, Congress did not (in fact could not) void ACA’s individual mandate via TCJA, only its specific charge.

Judge O’Connor further opines that the individual mandate was so indispensable  to furthering Congress’ original intent of the ACA to control health care costs that it cannot be severed from its provisions. “<span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/211-texas-order-granting-plaintiffs-partial-summary-judgment.pdf">In sum</a></span>,” states the court, “the Individual Mandate ‘is so interwoven with [ACA’s] regulations that they cannot be separated. None of them can stand.’”

Congress and the Supreme Court acknowledge the critical role of the individual mandate to prevent adverse selection, analogizing it as the <span><a href="https://econofact.org/health-insurance-without-the-individual-mandate-can-a-three-legged-stool-stand-on-two-legs">third leg of a stool</a></span> regarding the larger act. The text of the ACA crafted by Congress, however, does not explicitly suggest the individual mandate provision is non-severable from the act. Nor would loss of the mandate completely thwart ACA implementation within the health care marketplace. Even as the <span><a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/20/gop-tax-bill-cuts-start/">effective date</a></span> (January 1, 2019) of TCJA’s removal of the mandate exaction approaches, multiple ACA activities have continued unabated, including sales of <span><a href="https://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/11.8m-members-bought-health-plans-via-affordable-care-act-exchanges">millions of individual health insurance policies</a></span> on the national and state exchanges in 2018 alone.

Judge O’Connor acknowledges constitutional limits of the role of courts in questioning and replacing Congressional policy with their own, but reads into the ACA conclusions under the premise of severability that Congress did not reach and the Supreme Court may not support. When the Supreme Court disabled core facets of Medicaid expansion in <em>NFIB v. Sebelius</em> (reducing states’ financial incentives to comply), it did not negate expansion entirely, much less the entire ACA. Expansion, like the individual mandate, is a severable component of the much larger act.

<strong>Current and Potential Impacts</strong>

Immediate legal impacts of the court’s decision are minimal. Judge O’Connor did not simultaneously issue the <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html">cessation of all ACA provisions</a></span> in his decision. Forthcoming <span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/14/677002085/texas-judge-rules-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-but-supporters-vow-to-app">petitions to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a></span> in New Orleans will likely stay any direct enforcement of the lower court opinion. <span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/16/obama-responds-obamacare-ruling/2329964002/">President Obama</a></span>, the <span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">White House</a></span>, and others have already confirmed that key ACA protections will continue to apply into 2019. If the case winds its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, it will again face the daunting challenge of maintaining judicial independence against mounting political pressures.

Meanwhile federal legislators on both sides of the aisle are distancing themselves from the holding. <span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/federal-judge-in-texas-rules-obama-health-care-law-unconstitutional/2018/12/14/9e8bb5a2-fd63-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html?utm_term=.6b24efe10496">Some Republicans</a></span> sense the court has gone too far in pillaging ACA. Embracing support for health care popularized in the November elections, Democrats in the House of Representatives are mobilizing to advance <span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/12/14/677002085/texas-judge-rules-affordable-care-act-unconstitutional-but-supporters-vow-to-app">legislative options</a></span> to preserve the act. Although nothing will come easy in the next Congress, an initial fix may be to reinstate charges underlying the individual mandate. Authorizing even a minimal charge for failing to acquire health insurance would generate some revenue in defiance of the federal district court.

The larger effects of the <em>Texas</em> decision extend from political reactions from President Trump, his executive agencies, and similarly-minded state and local policymakers. President Trump immediately declared the court’s decision a “<span><a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-affordable-care-act-repeal-texas-ruling-83812ad2-795b-4a26-9650-fe39216cc906.html">big, big victory</a></span>.” Despite popular support for the ACA, the federal administration may use the <em>Texas</em> decision as grounds for invalidating, ignoring, or obviating enforcement of the ACA in 2019.

Since taking office, President Trump’s administration has demonstrated open hostility to ACA’s core provisions. Health insurance subsidies have been slashed while skimpy insurance plans have been promoted. States have been encouraged to seek Medicaid waivers to allow work requirements for beneficiaries or limit essential health benefits. Objections to ACA requirements grounded in religious or conscientious beliefs have materialized. Employer mandates to require coverage have stalled.

Collectively these maneuvers have led several jurisdictions to sue the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to demand it actually enforce ACA’s provisions. A decision in the ongoing case, <span><em><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20180917.479910/full/">Maryland v. United States</a></em></span>, could reach an inapposite conclusion from the federal district court in Texas. At the epicenter of the continued legal saga over the ACA is the health of millions of Americans immediately placed at risk.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Pakistan Supreme Court’s creation of a fund for the construction of two dams in the country is an unprecedented overreach of judicial power that threatens to undermine the development of good governance in the executive branch of government. Additionally, the unrestrained exercise of judicial power is likely to not only result in the judicialization of politics but lead to the ultimate politicization of the judiciary as well, which would undermine public respect for the institution. The judiciary is defending this unconstitutional power grab by citing several articles of the Constitution, but an examination of these articles clearly indicates that the Court has misconstrued and misapplied each of these provisions. If allowed to stand, this judicial overreach threatens to undermine the constitutional separation of powers.

The creation of the Supreme Court’s Dam Fund is predicated on a recent judgment in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/Const.P.57%20_2016.pdf"><em>Barrister Zafarullah Khan vs. Federation of Pakistan</em></a> in which the Court asserted that the “<em>right to life is a fundamental right and without water there can be no existence of life. The establishment of water reservoirs is therefore not a question of just quality of life rather the very existence thereof. Therefore, in terms of the provisions of <a href="https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-184-original-jurisdiction-of-supreme-court/">Article 184(3) of the Constitution</a> read with <a href="https://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/article-9-security-of-person/">Article 9</a> and as guardians of the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan, this Court has the jurisdiction to issue necessary directions to the Government for the practical enforcement of the primordial right to life.</em>” Consequently, it directed “<em>the establishment of an account … in the name of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, for collecting funds donated by the people of Pakistan for the construction and establishment of the aforementioned dams</em>” (para. 3(4), Judgment) and appealed to “<em>the Nation for making its contributions, whether in the shape of foreign currency or in Pakistani rupees, directly to the said account</em>” (para. 3(5), Judgment). It further directed that the contributions will enjoy tax free status. For this purpose, the Federal Board of Revenue, the Government of Pakistan and the Provincial Governments were required to “<em>issue such notifications, instructions and orders that ensure that both the contributors to the Fund and the amounts they have deposited therein enjoy complete exemption from tax or scrutiny</em>” (para. 11, Judgment). The Court ordered the tax authorities specifically not to ask any questions about the source of funds contributed to the Dam Fund.

The Supreme Court not only established an account to collect funds for the construction of the dams but also constituted an Implementation Committee to supervise and oversee the construction. It directed that the account will be operated under its orders on the recommendations of the Implementation Committee and indicated that the utilization of the funds in the account will be subject to audit as per directions of the Court. Furthermore, the Court ordered that “<em>the entire process shall be under oversight of two monitoring judges of this Court to be appointed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan specifically for this project” </em>(para. 11, Judgment).

The Judgment stands out among the growing number of judicial precedents based on the Court’s unrestrained exercise of its <em>suo motu</em> powers under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan. It is an extreme example of judicial foray into executive and fiscal matters. Therefore, the Judgment, no matter how well intentioned and beneficial as it may be, is distressing because of the blatant misuse of judicial power. <strong>It thus raises not only questions of judicial propriety but a number of constitutional and legal issues as well.</strong> Firstly, does the Court have the constitutional authority to take up this matter? Furthermore, does the Court have the legal mandate to create and maintain a fund for construction of dams or any other purpose? Is it lawful for the Court to supervise the funding or monitor the construction of dams? Is the Court empowered to exempt donations from all kinds of taxes? Is it just and proper for the Court to order the tax authorities not to ask any questions relating to the source of funds contributed to the Dam Fund? Would it be proper for the Dam Fund to be audited under the directions of the Court? Last but not least, is it just and proper for the Court or Chief Justice to appeal to the people of Pakistan to contribute or donate to the proposed or any other fund? From the discussion below, it is evident that the answers to all these questions are in the negative.
<p style="text-align: center">Misapplied and Misconstrued Application of the Constitution</p>
<a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">The Constitution of Pakistan</a> mandates that “<em>[n]o court shall have any jurisdiction save as is or may be conferred on it by the Constitution or by or under any law</em>” (Art. 175(2)). As discussed below, the Court did not have constitutional power to invoke its jurisdictional authority. Neither the Constitution nor any other law empowers the Court to directly create and maintain a fund for any purpose. The Constitution certainly does not give any general or specific mandate to the Court to authorize the funding or construction of dams. No other subordinate legislation mandates the Court to create and maintain a fund for the construction of dams or even supervise the funding of dams and monitor the construction. Under the Constitution, the Court has been assigned an adjudicatory and not an executive role. The Court does not have any fiscal powers to exempt tax or to order the tax authorities not to ask any questions relating to the source of funds contributed to the Dam Fund. Furthermore, given the fact that the Court has supervisory control over the operation of the account, it would also not be proper for the Dam Fund to be audited under its directions. Under the Supreme Court Rules, the Chief Justice’s functions and powers are limited to the administration of the Court and its officers. He has not been given any economic role or political responsibilities. He does not have any constitutional or legal mandate to conduct banking or financial transactions. Given his status and authority, it is obviously not just and proper for the Chief Justice to appeal to the people to contribute or donate money to the Dam Fund. These conclusions are based on the following critical legal analysis of the Judgment.

An examination of the Articles cited by the Court in its judgment clearly indicates that the Court has misconstrued and misapplied each of these provisions. The Court has, in its Judgment, relied mainly on Articles 9, 78 and 184(3) of the Constitution and Articles 11 and 12 of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (<strong>ESC Rights Covenant</strong>)</a>. The Judgment, in relevant part, provides that <em>“… water is a resource to which everyone is entitled … and forms the basis of many other rights including the right to life, health and quality of life. It is a fundamental right that emanates from the right to life enshrined in Article 9 of the Constitution …” </em>(para. 2).

The Court’s reliance on Article 9 of the Constitution is misplaced as the Principles of Policy do not confer any enforceable rights the way Fundamental Rights do under the Constitution. Article 9 provides: “<em>No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law.</em>” A plain textual interpretation of Article 9 suggests that it deals with the <strong>divestment</strong> of a right rather than the <strong>provision</strong> of a right. There is no direct obligation to provide water in this Article and if the Court considers this to be an integral part of the right to life, then what about food? Isn’t food also essential to life despite the Court’s inexplicable view that “<em>[i]t is well-known that human beings can survive longer without food than without water …</em>” (para.1, Judgment). It is, therefore, not practicable to make this an enforceable right. The promotional aspect of providing food, which includes water, is covered by the Principles of Policy enshrined in the Constitution. Article 38(d) of the Constitution requires the State to “<em>provide basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, housing, education and medical relief, for all such citizens …</em>”. <strong>But as the Principles of Policy do not confer any enforceable rights the way Fundamental Rights do under the Constitution, the Court’s reading provides no support to their creation of a Dam Fund. </strong>

The Court’s reliance on international resolutions, declarations and general comments is even more misplaced as these documents do not even have binding effect much less are they legally enforceable. The Court cited Articles 11 and 12 of the ESC Rights Covenant, pointing out that Pakistan has ratified this Covenant in 2008 but its unequivocal statement that “<em>according to Articles 11 and 12 thereof, Pakistan is required to better manage its territorial water resources in order to secure the right to water of its citizens</em>” (Para. 5, Judgment) is not borne out by the literal wording of these Articles. Furthermore, the ESC Rights Covenant, even though binding on Pakistan because of its ratification, is not enforceable since Pakistan is a dualist State wherein a treaty is required to be legislated before it can have effect. The ESC Rights Covenant has not to date been enacted in Pakistan. On further analysis of the Judgment, it appears that the Court’s reliance is not directly on Articles 11 and 12 of the ESC Rights Covenant but merely on a general comment thereon by a United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: “<em>In the global context, numerous international resolutions, conventions, and declarations also highlight the importance of water. The most apt description is the following extract from <a href="https://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/water/docs/CESCR_GC_15.pdf">General Comment No.15 (2002)</a> … to which we fully subscribe:- ‘Water is a limited natural resource and a public good fundamental for life and health. The human right to water is indispensable for leading a life in human dignity. It is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights’</em>” (Para. 2). <strong>The Court cited international resolutions, declarations and general comments that have no binding effect to justify their judicial activism.</strong>

The Court’s further reliance on Article 78 of the Constitution to set up the Dam Fund is also misplaced. According to it: “<em>Under the provisions of Article 78 of the Constitution, any funds deposited in the Public Account of the Federation can be dedicated for a specified project or purpose. We therefore direct the establishment of an account, for the time being in the name of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, for collecting funds donated by the people of Pakistan for the construction and establishment of the aforementioned dams</em>” (para. 3.4, Judgment). Article 78 of the Constitution, in relevant part, provides: “<em>(2) All … moneys … (b) received by or deposited with the Supreme Court or any other court established under the authority of the Federation … shall be credited to the Public Account of the Federation.</em>” There is nothing in this constitutional provision itself or any other legislative enactment that empowers the Court to direct the establishment of an account for collecting funds donated by the people for construction and establishment of dams, particularly in the name of the Registrar of the Court. The Court is only authorized to receive moneys (such as court fees) and deposits (such as penalties) under various laws and not on its own motion (such as dam fund contributions from the public). All moneys received by or deposited with the Court are required to be credited to the Public Account, the custody of which is dealt with by Article 79 of the Constitution: “<em>The … custody of other moneys received by or on behalf of the Federal Government, their payment into, and withdrawal from, the Public Account of the Federation, and all matters connected with or ancillary to the matters aforesaid shall be regulated by Act of Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) or, until provision in that behalf is so made, by rules made by the President.</em>” Neither Article 78 nor Article 79 of the Constitution specifically provide for any funds deposited in the Public Account to be dedicated for a specified project or purpose, at least certainly not without any parliamentary enactment or presidential rules. Oddly enough, there is no mention of Article 79 of the Constitution in the Judgment.

Under the above circumstances, the Court has misapplied Article 184(3) of the Constitution. This Article, in relevant part, provides: “<em>Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 199, the Supreme Court shall, if it considers that a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of the nature mentioned in the said Article.</em>” The instant case does not involve any fundamental right as Article 9 of the Constitution is not applicable as indicated above. The matter is covered by Article 38(d) of the Constitution, which is a principle of policy and not an enforceable fundamental right. In any event, the Court has gone beyond its power to make an order not of the nature mentioned in Article 199 of the Constitution as required by Article 184(3). The Court has clearly gone beyond its constitutional mandate to exercise authority in this matter. At most what it could have done, if it had jurisdiction, was to direct the Government to formulate, adopt and implement a Water Policy—as it did in the concluding paragraph of its Judgment (para. 14).
<p style="text-align: center">A Threat to the Separation of Powers</p>
The Constitution envisages a clear separation of powers between the judiciary and the executive (Art. 175(3), Constitution). The funding or the construction of dams is clearly an executive function. Water supply and the construction of hydro-electric power installations falls within the executive domain under the Constitution. The executive branch of government has not only established the Water and Power Division but has also created a specialized technical legal entity called <a href="http://mowr.gov.pk/index.php/wapda/">Water and Power Development Authority (<strong>WAPDA</strong>)</a> for carrying out these functions. The judicial usurpation of these functions is not only likely to negate the constitutional and legal authority but may also prejudicially affect the political relationship between the Federation and Provinces. Although the Court has recognized the fact that “<em>the issue of alleviating water shortage is essentially within the realm of the executive</em>,” and has accordingly directed “<em>the Federal and Provincial Governments, WAPDA and all the Executive Authorities in Pakistan who are responsible or have nexus/connection with the building of the afore-said dams and all matters connected thereto, to take all necessary steps for the commencement of construction and early completion of these dams</em>” (paras. 3.2 &amp; 8, Judgment), it crossed all judicial boundaries by establishing the Dam Fund and constituting an Implementation Committee for the construction of the dams and also for oversight of execution of their works (para. 3, Judgment). Furthermore, judicial foray into fiscal and audit issues also undermines the constitutional mandate, independence and authority of the legislature and Auditor General of Pakistan in these matters. It is apparent from a cursory review of the Constitution that all the Court actions, i.e. establishment of the Dam Fund by judicial fiat and the effort of the Court to supervise the funding or monitor the construction of dams, exemption of donations from all kinds of taxes, and getting the Dam Fund audited under its direction, are beyond its constitutional power and legal authority. The Court has sought to address a complex issue in a simplistic, naïve and invasive manner. <strong>The fundamental issue is lack of good governance in the country, which is only likely to get compounded with unwarranted and excessive judicial interference.</strong>
<p style="text-align: center">An Unjustifiable Use of Judicial Influence</p>
The Chief Justice’s emotional appeal to the nation to contribute to the Dam Fund and his continuing personal involvement in the matter and the resultant massive advertisement campaign at public expense is totally unwarranted. It is pertinent to note that the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=435">Judicial Code of Conduct</a> (<strong>Code</strong>) unequivocally states that the oath of a Judge implies complete submission to the Constitution, and under the Constitution to the law. Consequently, a judge is required to be law-abiding and his functions are limited to the interpretation and application of the Constitution and the law. He is further required to maintain proper judicial conduct. Article V of the Code specifically provides: “<em>Functioning as he does in full view of the public, a Judge gets thereby all the publicity that is good for him. He should not seek more. In particular, he should not engage in any public controversy,</em><strong><em> least of all on a political question, notwithstanding that it involves a question of law</em></strong><strong>”</strong> (emphasis added). Notwithstanding the nobility of the cause, the establishment of the Dam Fund has generated political controversy. The further appeal by the Chief Justice to the general public to contribute generously to the Dam Fund is conduct unbecoming of a judge. Article VI of the Code specifically cautions: “<em>To employ the influence of his position to gain undue advantage, whether immediate or future, is a grave fault.” </em>Besides wielding judicial influence unjustifiably, it appears to be even otherwise improper to solicit funds without a feasibility report or information memorandum regarding the Dam projects. It would, therefore, be expedient for the Chief Justice and other judges of the Court to show judicial restraint in this regard. Unrestrained exercise of judicial power would be tantamount to judicial abuse, which is likely to diminish public confidence and ultimately erode the moral authority of the institution.

Finally, and most importantly, the apparent <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1433201">threat by the Chief Justice of Pakistan</a> of charging dam opponents with treason is manifestly unfair. It militates against the fundamental right of free speech guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution. Article 184(3) of the Constitution that the Chief Justice relies on to assert the Court’s <em>suo motu</em> powers is intended to protect fundamental rights and not to negate them.
