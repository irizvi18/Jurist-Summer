		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dr. Barry A. Feinstein, a Senior Lecturer in International Law at the School of Law of Netanya Academic College in Israel, says that it is imperative to conduct a proportionality analysis of Israel's military actions against the Mavi Marmara and the Gaza Flotilla....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Feinsteinhead.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n a <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2010/12/gaza-flotilla-international-law-justifications-for-israels-actions.php">companion article</a> [JURIST commentary] appearing in JURIST, I showed that the actions undertaken by the Israel navy against the flotilla of vessels bound for Gaza on May 31, 2010, were conducted in accordance with long - standing principles of the law of armed conflict at sea.  It is important to understand that according to these principles, the concept of proportionality takes on a different connotation than is commonly perceived.  To begin with, the issue is not whether a blockade inflicts damage, or even severe damage, on a civilian population.  After all an unfortunate though natural and legitimate consequence of a blockade is indeed the infliction of damage on civilians.  Nor is the issue whether the damage in and of itself subjectively appears to be "proportionate" or not.  Rather the issue is whether "the damage to the civilian population is, or may be expected to be, excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the blockade." The practical implication of <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/7694fe2016f347e1c125641f002d49ce">this principle</a> is that the greater the military goal that is anticipated, the more civilian damage will be considered to be within acceptable limits, and certainly high on the priority list of anticipated military advantages stemming from the naval blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza is the creation of a deterrent for vessels that might otherwise try to smuggle by sea into Gaza weapons such as missiles and rockets that constantly have been used against nearly one million Israeli civilians who live in Israel's southern region and who have literally been held hostage by the thousands of rockets and missiles indiscriminately fired at them from Gaza since 2001.  Had the flotilla vessels not been stopped, this further would have raised critical questions regarding the blockade's effectiveness and its impartial application to vessels of all States, which together with the declaration of the blockade, all constitute necessary conditions for the existence of a legal blockade in the first place in an armed conflict at sea.</p>

<p>Israel had the right, as would any other State engaged in armed conflict, to control flotilla vessels sailing in the immediate vicinity of naval operations,  and those vessels which did not comply with orders given them by it in this regard could be presumed to have hostile intent or enemy character and thus could be treated as enemy ships.  Flotilla vessels that engaged in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or made an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy, or that were reasonably believed to be breaching the blockade or to be carrying contraband, after they had been given prior warning and when they clearly and intentionally refused to stop or resisted visit, search or capture, also could be attacked on the high seas, like military objectives.  Yet, in any armed conflict situation, military operations may be directed only against military objectives, which may be attacked with all the consequent destruction and casualties, and they must always be distinguished from civilian objects.</p>

<p>Just as military objectives may be legitimately attacked, so too are those who take part in the fighting considered legitimate targets and may be attacked with all the consequent death and injury, yet they similarly must at all times be distinguished from civilians, meaning that a distinction must be made between those who take part in the fighting and those who do not take part in the fighting and who must be shielded, as far as possible, from its effects.  However a civilian may not at the same time be engaged in hostile action while retaining a civilian status. While those who are not taking a part in the conduct of hostilities may not legitimately be attacked, if civilians do actively engage in hostilities, their <a href="http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule6#refFn5">civilian status is subsequently revoked</a>.  "Loss of protection against attack," explains the International Committee of the Red Cross, "is clear and uncontested ... when a civilian uses weapons or other means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces."   Thus, any individuals traveling with the flotilla who used knives, guns, metal bars and chains, or other means to carry out violent acts against Israel naval personnel lost their protected status as civilians and therefore could be legitimately targeted.  </p>

<p>While unavoidable incidental civilian casualties and damage, occurring as a result of legitimate attacks on military objectives, are not rendered illegal, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/560-11?OpenDocument">proportionality rule for armed conflict at sea</a> situations dictates that an attack is not to "be launched if it may be expected to cause collateral casualties or damage which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the attack as a whole."   Yet, any collateral casualties and damage that did occur on board the flotilla vessels obviously had not been expected at all by the Israelis.  Most significantly, though, any civilians who had been harmed in the incident yet had committed acts of violence against Israel naval personnel have under international law consequently lost their protected status as civilians and obviously must therefore be factored out of any collateral casualty count since they as such would have constituted legitimate military targets.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the obligation for curtailing risks to civilians lies with the "defender," although the attacker must avoid intentionally attacking them, and extends the responsibility of the "defender" to take action minimizing the risk of injury or damage and to preclude their use to shield military operations.  Thus accommodations should be made in the proportionality analysis, when calculating whether civilian casualties were excessive or not, for casualties that accrued as a result of those who committed acts of violence against Israel naval personnel purposefully and callously locating themselves amongst the others on board the flotilla vessels, utilizing them as human shields, since using passengers and crew as human shields certainly increased the number of civilian casualties.  For the same reason, the fact that casualties and damage occurred on board flotilla vessels that could legitimately be attacked as military objectives if they were engaged in belligerent acts on the enemy's behalf or made an effective contribution to the military action of the enemy, or if they were reasonably believed to be breaching the blockade or to be carrying contraband, after they had been given prior warning and that clearly and intentionally refused to stop or resisted visit, search or capture, must also be taken into account in the proportionality consideration as a factor that necessarily augmented as well the amount of civilian casualties.</p>

<p>Additionally miscalculations, like operational and intelligence mistakes, however tragic and unfortunate, are a natural and lamentable consequence of armed conflicts and civilian effects emanating from such inevitable yet unintended and inadvertent errors certainly were not expected and are thus to be excluded from the collateral casualty and damage part of the proportionality equation. </p>

<p>Furthermore, when weighing the excessiveness vis - à - vis the military advantage in examining proportionality, it is not the concept of just a military advantage as such that is to be used in the analysis, but rather it is the relation between the anticipated overall military advantage and the excessiveness of the incidental civilian casualties or damage that is to be taken into consideration, in the sense of the making of a contribution that would be relevant to the total operation's success and assessed from a general strategic perspective and not solely as relating to military benefits derived from a particular tactical circumstance at one specific point in time.  The military advantage does not have to be an immediate one, the standard for measuring it being the military advantage expected from the military campaign as a whole, which the attack is a part of, and not solely the military advantage of each isolated or specific component of the military operation or campaign.  In other words, the overall war strategy or operational plan is an integral part of the military advantage component of the proportionality analysis, and obviously a part of Israel's overall war strategy or operational plan is to conduct military operations that would reduce the smuggling by sea into Gaza of weapons like the thousands of missiles and rockets that continuously have been fired randomly at some one million Israelis.</p>

<p>The assessment of any military situation moreover must be based on the facts as the commander perceived them at the time of the operation and not as they appeared retrospectively.  Consequently, any analysis that pertains to proportionality in armed conflict should be made through the eyes of a reasonable military commander at the scene engaged in the heat of hostilities at the time who uses his most reasoned consideration and judgment in order to evaluate all the pertinent aspects, not least of which is the security of his own force.  The military advantage element of the proportionality analysis therefore also includes force protection.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/560-11?OpenDocument">During armed conflict at sea</a>, "those who plan, decide upon or execute an attack" must "take all feasible precautions in the choice of methods and means in order to avoid or minimize collateral casualties or damage."   The Israel navy took many precautions to avoid or minimize collateral casualties or damage in the flotilla incident, such as by selecting the method to board and take control over the flotilla vessels rather than to sink them, which for example would have been permissible if they were breaching the blockade and resisted capture following a prior warning, by choosing to conduct the procedure of boarding the ships on the high seas rather than waiting until they had come closer to land as a conscious precautionary measure designed to spare lives and which as a result most likely did save countless lives of flotilla passengers and crew, Gazans, and Israelis alike, by making the decision to use non - lethal weapons like paintballs unless lives were endangered, and by issuing instructions to naval personnel to exercise the minimum amount of force necessary with the maximum amount of restraint.  It must be borne in mind that it was only when Israel naval personnel had been attacked and their lives were threatened did they resort to live fire to defend themselves, which of course they naturally had the right to do.  <br />
	<br />
Thus according to the law of armed conflict at sea, the Israel navy did not act in a disproportionate fashion when it imposed and enforced on the high seas the naval blockade on Gaza and when it boarded and took control over flotilla vessels on the high seas.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=http://www.kaveity.nl/professionals/Gerolf_Hagens.htm>Gerolf Hagens</a></strong> [Teamleider, <a href=http://www.kaveity.nl/>Kaveity and Kaveity</a>]:
                "On November 4th, 1950 the European Convention on Human Rights was brought to life; 13 countries (including Ireland, the United Kingdom, Greece and the Netherlands) signed the convention in Rome. Over time, 47 countries have joined the Council of Europe, which promotes human rights and coordinates the proper application of the European Convention on Human Rights. In the Convention, the right to life is mentioned several times, as in article 2, which provides that everyone's life shall be protected by law, and in article 8, which provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence" Whereas Article 2 refers to life in its formal sense (i.e. all have the right to live, and the taking of another's life is prohibited except in certain circumstances), Article 8 is about life in its material sense (i.e. certain parts of the quality of life).</p>

                <p>The scope of the right to life under article 2 has produced a lot of debate as well as case law. This is due to the variety of cultures that can be found in Europe, which consists of highly religious countries (e.g., Ireland, Greece and Poland), and more secular states such as The Netherlands or France. The former group are very reluctant to make changes to their religious identities, and consequently exercise very rigid policy when it comes to abortion or euthanasia.</p>

                <p>It was never explicitly stated that abortion or euthanasia fell within the scope of article 2; in the 1950's these subjects were controversial in several of the founding countries of the European Convention. Until now, the member states had never agreed upon a solution, nor had the court ever widened the scope of the right to life under this article. The court's silence, however, does not indicate a deference to national governments on these controversial matters. On the contrary, the court has found different ways to create a (be it limited) right to abortion, framing a baby's right to life as something which is weighed against the mother's article 8 rights, which involve her personal autonomy and physical and psychological integrity. </p>

                <p>This may still not be a problem; article 8 does not give an absolute right to abortion. So, if national law denies abortion, it can only be allowed if the article's limitation grounds are fulfilled. This means two questions have to be answered:
                </P><p>(1)Is the limitation necessary in a democratic society? and
                </p><p>(2)Is there a legitimate goal for this limitation?</p>
                <p>
                    The first point is mainly for the national governments to decide. The European Court accepts that is not equipped to decide whether restriction is necessary. Only in rare cases where it is obvious that a certain restrictive measure is not necessary, the European court will conclude there is a violation. In the<a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php> recent case against Ireland</a> this was one of the main arguments; the applicants claimed that there was no democratic necessity for the abortion ban. The court did not share this point of view, refusing to stray from the margin of appreciation principle.
                </p><p>
                    The second question is a bigger problem; public security can hardly be called a legitimate justification of the restriction of abortion. However, the protection of morality is a potential ground for limitation (as can be seen in the <em>Open Doors</em> judgment of the European Court, where it says that profound moral values could justify restriction). So too is the protection of the rights of others (an unborn child could have the right to life under article 2 of the convention, and so a member state could protect that right by restricting abortion).
                </p><p>
                    Thus there is still room to limit abortion. But while the <a href=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=878721&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649> judgment</a> was considered to widen the scope of articles 2 and 8, in reality not much has changed. And this is, in my eyes, the appropriate solution. As in every country, it has taken some time for abortion and euthanasia to be accepted. Countries that have cultural barriers should not be forced to change their morals, especially when there are alternatives for people that do not want to wait until these morals change or break down."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brittany Haglund, Widener Law '11, is President of Widener's Military Law Society and a military spouse. She writes about Congress' recent repeal of President Clinton's Don't Ask, Don't Tell Policy...</p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n December 18, 2010, Congress voted to repeal President Clinton's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy (DADT). Six days later, a smiling President Obama signed the repeal. This should be a major victory but it leaves me feeling dissatisfied: haven't we been here before? Our country always seems to be struggling with discrimination of some type in the military. Prior to the Korean War, racial segregation was the norm, and it took a second world war for permanent positions in the military to be made available to women. Now, proponents of DADT claim that discrimination of openly gay servicemembers is necessary to ensure that the morale and cohesion of the military remains strong. However, are these not the same declarations once made by supporters of racial segregation and an all-male military? With the magic of hindsight, we can see that the few hiccups that occurred after outlawing racial and sexual discrimination in the military did not single-handedly destroy the group mentality necessary for an efficient military.</p>

<p>Even with all of the historical evidence, supporters of DADT fear the consequences of the repeal will be disastrous. America's military is comprised of volunteer members, the majority of whom are arguably from religious and conservative areas of the country. Without DADT, it is feared that the pool of volunteers may dry up because they will be unable to reconcile their beliefs with the new law while continuing to serve. Others save their reservations for those serving in combat zones, arguing that hate crimes against homosexuals will run rampant and numerous lives will be lost because servicemen and servicewomen will not trust each other.  Again, it is unnecessary to engage in these what-ifs because history has already shown us that the military will endure. After President Truman signed an executive order ending racial segregation in the military, there was not a significant drop in the number of troops who voluntarily enlisted, although there is an argument that the Vietnam draft a few years later ameliorated any possible decrease in troops. As for troops in combat conditions, there is a famous quote from the Second World War that I believe applies equally to the situation at hand. The quote states: "There are no atheists in foxholes." Well, I say: "There are no hate mongers in combat." This may be a slight exaggeration, but it seems that with the type of guerrilla warfare soldiers face in the Middle East, it is doubtful they will have the time or energy to invest in hating someone who is not a threat to their mission. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. </p>

<p>Regardless of DADT supporters' views, it has been repealed and rightly so for both constitutional and moral reasons. Prior to the Supreme Court' decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html"><span class="casename">Lawrence v. Texas</span></a>, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), DADT only had to survive a lenient standard of review to be upheld. This is because in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0478_0186_ZS.html"><span class="casename">Bowers v. Hardwick</span></a>, the Supreme Court failed to find a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy. However, in <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> the Court found a Texas law outlawing homosexual sodomy was unconstitutional because "[t]he right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives [homosexuals] the full right to engage in their conduct without the intervention of the government." While the message from <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> is clear - homosexual behavior cannot be made unlawful simply because some in the community may find it immoral - the standard of review when evaluating laws against homosexual behavior is still fuzzy at best. </p>

<p>DADT further complicated the assessment of laws against homosexual activities because it only applied to military members. Traditionally, the military is entitled to a great deal of deference, even though it is difficult to precisely measure the leniency of judicial review because it has varied throughout the years depending on the Court. A lenient application of constitutional standards in the military is claimed to be necessary to national security; the military requires obedience and discipline for lack of obedience.  To ensure that these goals are met it may sometimes be necessary for a law that would be unconstitutional when applied to civilians to be permissible when applied to service members. </p>

<p>However, since <span class="casename">Lawrence</span> was decided, it has been argued that such a deferential judicial standard is no longer appropriate. The current argument is that even though the military should be afforded some deference, when a law seeks to regulate a person's liberty interest, it will be upheld when narrowly tailored to support only the most compelling interest. This begs the question: were the interests put forward by the government and DADT supporters enough to satisfy such a demanding test, and if so, couldn't we have found other ways to meet these interests without systematically discriminating against thousands of service members? </p>

<p>As a military spouse, I see that life in the military depends on order and keeping up the morale of the troops, so I understand why proponents of DADT claim order and morale as their compelling interests. I take issue with the argument that allowing homosexuals to be open about their sexual preferences will destroy order and morale and that DADT is the only way to uphold order and morale. Most courts continue to dance around these issues, always deferring to Congress or the military when it came to military matters, when they should have applied the heightened standard of review from Lawrence and let the chips fall where they may. I realize the point seems moot now that DADT has been repealed, but since there was never widespread recognition that DADT was unconstitutional it can be implemented again. Our current President rode into the White House with promises of repealing DADT; who's to say our next leader will not advocate for its return? </p>

<p>Even if the policy is never again implemented, there are many questions that have been left unanswered because the policy's constitutionality was never decided. For instance, what will the quality of life be like for homosexuals in the military who want to live openly? Straight military members, unless the duty assignment is unaccompanied, are free to take their spouses with them to their new duty station, and the military either provides housing on base or a basic housing allowance to live off of base. Since the federal government still does not recognize gay marriages and the military does not recognize relationship statuses below marriage, where does this leave gay service members with significant others?  Sure, they can serve in the military while proclaiming their sexual orientation, but they will still face daily discrimination. Supporters of DADT will find other ways to relegate homosexuals in the military to a inferior status be it through restricted the housing of these service members or through the types of rates they can serve in. So while DADT has been repealed, I am left dissatisfied, as I am sure many others are as well. DADT's repeal is not enough because homosexuals will continue to face discrimination until the constitutionality of such discrimination is addressed by the courts. Once the issue of constitutionally is addressed it will no longer be necessary to fight for these service members' rights to live with whom they choose, be seen in public with their significant other, or even post a picture of their loved one above their bunk. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UNITED STATES: The Impact of the Citizen-Contractor Loophole on Political Asylum Claims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sarah Robison, University of Minnesota Law School '12, writes about the possible deleterious impact of the citizen-contractor loophole on asylum applicants...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>ndividuals applying for political asylum in the United States often believe that applying for asylum will alleviate their fear of persecution, but often do not realize that a citizen-contractor loophole in the asylum application process may give rise to a risk of future harm. US regulations prohibit the disclosure of information contained in or pertaining to any asylum application absent the written consent of the applicant or authorization of the Attorney General. <a href="http://law.justia.com/us/cfr/http://law.justia.com/us/cfr/title08/8-1.0.1.2.11.1.1.6.html">8 C.F.R. S. 208.6</a>. Under these regulations, the US Citizenship and Immigration Service ("the Service") may not disclose information or records that reveal that an alien has applied for asylum in the United States. Further, the S. 208.6 regulations require the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate with commensurate branches of government to ensure applicant confidentiality is maintained. These statutory prohibitions operate to safeguard an asylum applicant's personal information - information which, if made publically available, could subject the applicant to harm if she is repatriated to her country of origin. In <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/ cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr &sid=d396f8ff4cb 2e31b 712 6a5e4d04ccf44&rgn=div8&view=text&node=8:1.0.1.2.11.1.1.6&idno=8"><span class="casename">Lin v. Department of Justice</span></a> an asylum applicant's personal information was disclosed to his persecutors, and the Second Circuit held that seeking political asylum in the United States may give rise to a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>

<p>While 8 C.F.R S. 208.6 surely protects many asylum applicants from potential harm, it nonetheless suffers from a critical flaw: disclosure of an asylum applicant's personal information may still be made to United States government officials and contractors, including local citizen-contractors in the applicant's country of origin. Such citizen-contractors are foreign nationals employed by the Service and Consular Sections of US Embassies abroad to investigate claims and authenticate foreign documents for purposes of preventing fraud. In the course of such work, citizen-contractors are privy not only to information that indicates that an alien is applying for asylum, but are also privy to confidential documents and information contained in the alien's asylum application. Unfortunately, no standardized procedure exists to thoroughly vet citizen-contractors' backgrounds and affiliations. Thus, the possibility exists that citizen-contractors have close ties to an applicant's persecutors or, in certain instances, may even be the persecutors themselves. Besides raising serious issues of client confidentiality, this flaw endangers the very individuals 8 C.F.R S. 208.6 is designed to protect.</p>

<p>A defensive asylum case I worked on as a law clerk illustrates the deleterious impact the citizen-contractor loophole in 8 C.F.R S. 208.6 may have on an asylum applicant's future safety. Our client applied for relief through political asylum based on persecution suffered at the hands of the local government and police force in her country of origin. In the course of investigating her claim, the Immigration Judge requested that a document used to establish our client's identity be sent to the Consular Section of the US Embassy in her country of origin to be authenticated. A citizen-contractor employed by the Consular Section undertook the task of authenticating our client's document. This citizen-contractor happened to be a former member of the police force in our client's country of origin, one of the very actors responsible for her persecution. To our knowledge, this citizen-contractor was not thoroughly vetted by the Consular Section prior to beginning employment, and his actions within the scope of his former employment as a police officer were unknown. Thus, we did not know whether the citizen-contractor was one of our client's former persecutors or whether he retained ties with individuals who were.</p>

<p>The uncertainty surrounding the citizen-contractor's background and affiliations proved harmful to our client on multiple levels. First, the citizen-contractor, an individual formerly employed by our client's persecutor, gained knowledge of our client's whereabouts, her application for asylum, and certain details regarding her claim. This knowledge put our client at potential risk of harm both in the United States and, were our client repatriated, in her country of origin. Second, given the citizen-contractor's possible conflict of interest, we were concerned with the accuracy of his determination regarding the authenticity of our client's document. For example, the citizen-contractor could have reported that our client's document was fraudulent, even if it were in fact authentic. This finding would have undermined our client's credibility, increased the chance that our client would be repatriated to her country of origin, and effectively delivered our client into the hands of her persecutors.</p>

<p>Though our client was granted asylum and fortunately incurred no harm as a result of the citizen-contractor's involvement in her case, others affected by the S. 208.6 loophole may not be as fortunate. An increasing body of case law, including <span class="casename">Lin v. Department of Justice</span> and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/ cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr &sid=d396f8ff4cb 2e31b 712 6a5e4d04ccf44&rgn=div8&view=text&node=8:1.0.1.2.11.1.1.6&idno=8"><span class="casename">Befekadu-Ashene v. Holder</span></a>, illustrate the dangers that the citizen-contractor loophole of 8 C.F.R S. 208.6 poses to potential asylum applicants. Presently, the only remedy available to applicants harmed by the loophole is the opportunity to file a second asylum application or other form of relief based on the breach of confidentiality. However, this remedy fails to address the irreversible damage stemming from the potential disclosure of information to citizen-contractors in the applicant's country of origin. Until sufficient safeguards are adopted to mitigate the citizen-contractor loophole of 8 C.F.R. S. 208.6 and ensure the safety of asylum applicants, such as a standardized procedure for vetting citizen-contractors employed by the Service and Consular Sections of United States Embassies, those seeking shelter from persecution still remain at risk.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PITTSBURGH: Politics Impede Marcellus Shale Development</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Schaeffer, Pitt Law '12, attended the Hot Shale Plays conference co-hosted by the <a href="http://www.rmmlf.org/">Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.emlf.org/">Energy and Mineral Law Foundation</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He writes about the Pittsburgh City Council's ban on Marcellus Shale drilling...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>P</strong></font>ittsburgh recently played host to a RMMLF and EMLF co-sponsored special institute titled "Development Issues in the Major Shale Plays," but nicknamed "Hot Shale Plays." The short title was rife with irony and double-meaning, a fact I hope was not lost on the other attendees. Marcellus Shale is hot in the sense of being one of the fastest growing energy sources in America. It's hot in the sense of spurring new business. And it's certainly hot in the sense of spurring opposition to that new business. What Marcellus Shale drilling is not, however, is aesthetically pleasing: a fact that is at least partly to blame for the controversy surrounding this energy source. In fact, Pittsburgh City Council passed a ban on natural-gas production within city limits on November 16, 2010, meaning that the Hot Shale Plays conference had the distinction of being held in the first American City to ban the practice!</p>

<p>In a letter to municipal officials, City Council President Darlene M. Harris urged a ban on hydro-fracturing natural gas drilling ("fracing") because the "Commonwealth's lax regulatory environment and preemptions of our local laws have placed the oil and gas industry's corporate interests above the rights of citizens." This is tough talk. In her letter, Harris accuses Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection of catering to industry against the interests of Pennsylvania citizens. In passing the fracing ban on November 16, 2010, the Pittsburgh City Council appears to have agreed with her.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh City Council's concern is interesting for several reasons. Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is located, is one of the least developed parts of the Marcellus Shale basin. According to <a href="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/minres/oilgas/photogallery/photo13295/MarcellusWells%20permitte-drilled%20January-November%202010.gif">DEP data</a> (current through November 2010), only two permits were issued in Allegheny County since January 2010, and only one of those sites has come online. In contrast, Bradford County in Northeastern Pennsylvania saw 758 permits issued during that same period, and 355 of those permitted wells have come online. The fact is that most Pittsburgh residents have likely never even seen a Marcellus pad, as the well sites are called. In the two years that I have lived in Pittsburgh, I have only ever seen one Marcellus pad, and it was on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>This lack of development is at least partly attributable to Pittsburgh's urban environment. Marcellus shale operations are land-intensive. A single pad sits on 3-5 acres, and operators must construct or improve roads to reach the site. While it is true that recent advances in drill technology have allowed operators to drill horizontally up to approx. 10,000 feet in length, the amount of land required for the well pad makes drilling within city limits difficult. In addition to physical constraints, well operators often see site selection in city limits restricted by zoning requirements.<br />
If Allegheny County is home to so few Marcellus sites and urban development limits future development, why is Pittsburgh's City Council so concerned? Much can be attributed to the film "Gasland," a 2010 documentary by a Pennsylvania resident. "Gasland's" director, John Fox, travels across the country documenting hazardous environmental conditions supposedly attributable to hydraulic fracturing. He places particular emphasis on water quality issues that he suggests are attributable to natural gas leakage and the chemicals comprising part of the frac mix. In several particularly memorable scenes, Fox shows homeowners lighting their tap water on fire. </p>

<p>Since "Gasland's" release, Marcellus Shale operators have worked hard to stress their commitment to the environment. Range Resources, Pennsylvania's largest operator, operates a <a href="http://www.myrangeresources.com">site</a> for the public that emphasizes its commitment to safety. The Pennsylvania-based Marcellus Shale Coalition goes even further, linking to an article debunking "Gasland" on its front page. Industry frustration with "Gasland" is evident, with multiple speakers mentioning the film by name and arguing against its conclusions. A common refrain during the conference was that hydraulic fracturing has never been shown to have caused water quality issues. Industry representatives argued that the chemical mixtures used in the fracing process consist almost entirely of non-harmful materials. Furthermore, the water table lies at approximately 600 feet, and most fracing occurs at 6,000 feet, making contamination unlikely. When the speakers hypothesized causation, they most often cited faulty wells or water treatment systems, not hydraulic fracturing.</p>

<p>Science aside, Pittsburgh's hydraulic fracturing ban suggests that operators are losing the public relations battle. This is a shame. Marcellus Shale has huge potential as both an energy and revenue source. As of 2008, shale gas accounts for 10% of total US gas production, and this figure is estimated to rise to 25% of total US gas production by 2035. The Marcellus Shale deposit has the potential to be a particularly important source. The next three largest shale deposits - the Barnett, Fayetteville, and Haynesville plays - could fit within the Marcellus play with room to spare. Shale gas can meet a large portion of America's needs, and Pennsylvania, as a shale gas producer, can benefit from lower energy prices.</p>

<p>Marcellus Shale also has major financial benefits for the Pennsylvania citizens and government. Landowners in fee (or oil and gas rights holders) have received $1000-2000 per acre signing bonuses, in addition to royalties that Pennsylvania law sets at a 1/8 floor. Pennsylvanians also benefit as employees of Marcellus Shale operators. It is estimated that Marcellus Shale directly or indirectly employed 98,000 people and had a cumulative annual economic impact of USD 14 billion in 2010. By 2020, this is estimated to rise to 176,000 jobs and a USD 265 billion cumulative annual impact.</p>

<p>Marcellus Shale development has significant revenue potential for state and local governments, as well. It is estimated that by 2020, Marcellus Shale will contribute USD 15 billion in state and local tax revenue. For a city that was considering 10 percent across the board <a href="http://www.wpxi.com/news/24955951/detail.html">budget cuts</a> as recently as September 2010, tax revenue from Shale development would be a welcome addition to city coffers. Granted, possible financial benefits should not lead municipal officials to ignore environmental concerns. Nevertheless, a blanket prohibition of hydraulic fracturing within Pittsburgh city limits seems excessive in light of the relative youth of hydraulic fracturing technology, the failure of opponents to prove adverse environmental effects, and the possible financial benefits resulting from shale operations. Hydraulic fracturing is a new technology; it was first used in the Barnett shale field in Texas in 1991. In the Marcellus field, drilling commenced in 2004, and the first horizontal well was drilled in 2006. Given the technology's youth, in addition to the relatively small number of Marcellus wells in Allegheny County, the Pittsburgh City Council's outright ban seems premature. If the Pittsburgh City Council had concerns about the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, they should have imposed a moratorium similar to that imposed by the New York State legislature. This would have prevented drilling operations within city limits for a specified period of time, giving industry and environmentalists an opportunity to argue for or against the merits of hydraulic fracturing with the benefit of additional data and research. This is far more reasonable than an outright ban. A moratorium permits both sides to reargue the relative merits (or not) of hydraulic fracturing within city limits, whereas Pittsburgh's City Council has placed the burden of overturning the ban entirely on industry. Where hydraulic fracturing has yet to be directly linked to environmental problems, and particularly given the possible financial benefits of revenues from Marcellus Shale development, Pittsburgh City Council's ban seems shortsighted and excessive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Amanda M. Klasing, of Human Rights Watch says that following the first anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti, the international community and government of Haiti should allow Haitians to participate more in decision-making and increase accountability mechanisms...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/klasing.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>"W</b></font>hat will happen to us?" Guylaine asks me, with quiet resolve in her eyes. The question is not rhetorical.  A year after an earthquake rocked Haiti and the world scrambled to respond, Guylaine and her children live in a leaky tent in one of the informal camps that sprouted up on the day that Haiti changed forever. Guylaine is not alone; 20 pairs of eyes stare back at me waiting for an answer.  Each pair belongs to a woman.</p>

<p>I don't have the answers they seek, so I ask them what they want.  Everyone begins to shout at once, but there is consensus in the chorus. Survival.  Food.  Clean water.  Safe shelter. School for our children.  And, jobs. <br />
Each of these women is pregnant.  Clasping their pregnant bellies, they fight to have their voices heard for the first time.  They tell me their stories.  In March, after the government ordered aid groups to stop providing general food distribution, some women used relationships with men to secure food for their children.  Other women describe rape or violence in the camps.  Others tell of losing their husbands, along with their homes and all that they owned, in the earthquake.  One theme is clear in every story: survival. Survival by any means possible. </p>

<p>News stories will run in the coming days about the anniversary of the earthquake.  They will recap the size of the disaster, the unprecedented global response, the hurricane and cholera epidemic that have subsequently hit the beleaguered state, and the unresolved political crisis.  The stories will also tell of how little has changed since January 12, 2010: how many remain without homes, schools, jobs.  They will paint a picture of despair without an exit plan.  </p>

<p>A question nagging the human rights community as larger and larger natural disasters destroy more homes, lives, and livelihoods across the globe in poor and struggling countries is when a humanitarian disaster becomes a human rights concern.  One answer is provided by the women sitting under this tent with me.  <br />
In the year since the earthquake, no one has consulted them.  They have had no opportunity to participate in decision-making on the future of their country or their own families. When aid promises are broken, they have had nowhere to turn.  When men use positions of economic or political power to exploit these women for sexual favors, they have no options but to submit if they want to feed their children. </p>

<p>When they form relationships with men to normalize their lives or bring stability to their families, they have no access to reproductive health services to prevent pregnancy at a time when a pregnancy could be devastating to their health or their family's ability to feed itself.  When they do become pregnant, they do not have access to facilities to give birth and must give birth on the floor of their tent.  When they are raped in the camp, impunity is assured, and the perpetrators remain free.  When their children are turned away from school because they cannot afford the uniform, they have nowhere to complain. <br />
 <br />
In the best of times, the human rights community demands accountability, participation and inclusion, and equality and non-discrimination.  But these principles should also apply in the worst of times.  The international legal framework recognizes human rights as universal and inalienable.  Thus, the language of rights is worth no less in discussions about Haiti than discussions about Guantanamo Bay, less than 200 miles away.  In the face of unprecedented disaster, the fundamental principles of human rights should be applied most vigorously.  </p>

<p>In the year since the catastrophe, as the earthquake is called in Haiti, the international community has pledged billions of dollars in aid.  Yet, daily survival remains difficult.  Questions abound about what went right and what went wrong and what is to be done now.  Now that the shock has passed, the people who have the most to add to the conversation on reconstruction should be included.  A rights-based framework can guide the international community on how to accomplish that.  </p>

<p>The international community and Haiti's government need to provide space for Haitians in decision-making around "building back better," without regard to gender, education, or language abilities.  There are many potential avenues for participation at various levels within the recovery and reconstruction efforts.  On the ground, organizations and agencies working in camps should provide mechanisms for participation in camp management and service provision.  At the policy level, more women should be included in the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, including representatives from displacement camps.  <br />
The suggestion box projects used by some organizations to give a voice to the voiceless have been a symbolic first step but are insufficient to deal with the letters of desperation that were submitted.   </p>

<p>Accountability is fundamental to a rights-respecting reconstruction, and Haitians deserve accountability mechanisms as real as the problems they face.  The international community and Haiti's government should work together both to provide mechanisms for accountability and to strengthen the judicial system to address rights violations arising in the context of recovery and reconstruction.      <br />
The anniversary of the earthquake reminds the international community that the effects will be felt in Haiti for many years.  Some have called the quake an acute-on-chronic event, exacerbating problems that existed before.  This is also true of the human rights situation in Haiti.  The daily violations of a broad range of human rights did not stop with the earth's shaking.  Instead, the post-disaster situation has exposed even more clearly the fragility of human rights in Haiti. <br />
The 20 women who sat with me on that recent day, and the hundreds of thousands more like them struggling to be heard, should no longer be cast as victims of an unprecedented disaster. Instead, they should be seen as rights-holders with a stake in their own future, the future of their families, and of their country.  This new year should bring a shift in both discourse and implementation toward a greater realization of their rights.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Kevin Govern of Ave Maria School of Law says that the recent actions against U.S. Navy Captain (Capt.) Owen Honors is a regrettable redux of the Las Vegas, NV Tailhook Association scandal of 1991.  Still, this incident may reinvigorate the Department of Defense's efforts to promote dignity and respect for all service-members, to foster a culture of accountability, and to promote and to hold those in leadership positions consistent with the highest standards of moral and ethical conduct....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/kgovern.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n January 4, 2011, Admiral John C. Harvey Jr., Commander, United States Fleet Forces Command (USFFC), permanently relieved (stripped of command) Capt. Owen Honors of his duties as commanding officer of the world's longest and first nuclear aircraft carrier, the USS Enterprise (CVN 65).  The stated reason was Capt. Honors' demonstrated poor judgment, involving inappropriate sexual and scatological comments and actions while serving as executive officer (a/k/a XO), or second in command of that ship. </p>

<p>The philosopher George Santayana wrote in his <u>Reason in Common Sense, The Life of Reason, Vol.1</u>, that  "[t]hose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Unfortunately it appears that Honors - and perhaps others in his chain of command - forgot one of the infamous misconduct scandals in modern Naval history, the so-called Tailhook '91 convention in Las Vegas, NV.  At least 119 Navy and 21 Marine Corps officers were  referred by Pentagon investigators for  possible disciplinary actions involving indecent assault,  indecent exposure, conduct unbecoming an officer, dereliction of duty by failing to act in a proper  leadership capacity.  Another  51  individuals were found to have made false  official statements during the investigation. None  were court-martialed; instead charges were dropped or went to non-judicial punishment (NJP) known in the Navy as "Captain's Mast."   Both Secretary of the Navy  H. Lawrence Garrett III and Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Frank Kelso - attendees at Tailhook '91 - resigned within two years of the infamous convention, and one estimate indicated that the careers of fourteen admirals and almost  300 naval aviators were scuttled or damaged  by Tailhook.</p>

<p>Capt. Honors should have had a natural talent for excellence, and a prescience for steering clear of troubled waters - literally and figuratively.  Up until the incidents in question, Honors seemingly did everything the Navy would expect of an up and coming leader - and then some.  A native of Syracuse, N.Y., Honors graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1983, earned the golden wings of a Naval Aviator in September 1985, and graduated from the famed "Top Gun" school.  Holding positions of trust and responsibility as an aviator, staff officer, student and commander in peacetime and in combat, Honors reported as Executive Officer of the Enterprise (CVN-65) in July 2005.  </p>

<p>As XO, Honors evidently created and had broadcast over the Enterprise's closed-circuit television to some 6,000 embarked sailors (10-15% of which were women) a number of controversial, provocative, and by some accounts derogatory weekly "XO Movie Night" videos.  Those videos broadcast from May through November 2006 and July through December 2007, included but were not limited to comments and themes as the following:</p>

<p>- Foul language, including the "F-bomb;</p>

<p>- Material he recognized was demeaning and in poor taste, conceding in one video he'd been criticized because the clips aren't as funny as they used to -- "the XO's lost his b***" [crude slang for male genitalia];"</p>

<p>- Slurs he acknowledged were inappropriate about the sexual preferences of embarked sailors, including a comment on  "whether he should ask whether checkmates (the Enterprise-based fighter squadron VF-211) are gay" [in contravention of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell law codified at 10 U.S.C. S.6 654 (1993)], and "[f]inally, let's get to my favorite topic ... Something foreign to the gay kid over there -- chicks in the shower. This is certainly the most popular video of any of the XO Movie videos. It's also the one that's landed me with the most complaints." Those comments followed with amateurish movie clips of Honors peering into showers, finding two (impliedly) naked female sailors soaping each other, and two (impliedly) naked male sailors soaping each other;<br />
 <br />
- Criticizing and implying possible reprisal against whistleblowers [in contravention of 10 U.S.C. S. 1034 (1993)], to wit: "Over the years I've gotten several complaints about inappropriate material during these videos. Never to me personally but, gutlessly, through other channels;" and</p>

<p>- Clips showing Honors and other sailors pretending to masturbate during a rectal exam, set to a song called "Spank," and another scene implies that an officer is having sex in his stateroom with a donkey.</p>

<p>Excerpts from the videos and descriptions of their content were first published Saturday, January 1, 2011 by <em>The Virginian-Pilot </em>newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia. The Navy reacted quickly to the news stories and videos that went "viral" in national and world media. Official Navy spokesperson Commander Chris Sims said on CNN that: "Production of videos, like the ones produced four to five years ago on USS Enterprise and now being written about in <em>The Virginian-Pilot</em>, were not acceptable then and are still not acceptable in today's Navy...." The Navy does not endorse or condone these kinds of actions. The Virginia Pilot News report also went on to say Honors was asked to abandon his moviemaking in 2007 and complied. </p>

<p>If this was true, and his superior officers knew of these improprieties, why would Honors have received fitness reports setting up to succeed as Captain of the Enterprise, and then recommend at a board of officers to assume command of the ship where he previously committed acts of misconduct? Has the tolerance for misconduct in general, and sexually-oriented improprieties in particular, increased in recent years?</p>

<p>Since 1991, the Department of Defense has conducted 18 major investigations into sexual assault and sexual harassment in the Armed Forces.  The Pentagon says there were 3,230 reported sexual assaults involving military members in fiscal year 2009. That was an 11 percent increase from 2008, according to the statistics.  At the military service academies -- West Point and the Air Force and Naval academies -- there were 41 reports of sexual assault involving cadets and midshipmen during the 2009-2010 academic year.</p>

<p>At the same time, military officials estimate that as much as half of all sexual assaults in the ranks go unreported, and by General Accountability Office (GAO) estimates, the military's mandatory sexual assault prevention and response training programs are not "consistently effective." The GAO also concluded, amongst other findings, that many victims remain silent because they fear ridicule or believe that no action will be taken.</p>

<p>Kerry Dougherty, The Virginian-Pilot reporter who has broken much of this story to the world's attention, wrote recently that "according to the Enterprise's (un)official Facebook page, where folks are weighing in largely to defend the embattled Honors, these vulgar flicks delighted many," with such anonymous comments as "I believe Capt. Honors was trying to make himself approachable by his crew as well as improving the morale on a ship..."  He also quoted a former sailor, Jessica Roman who "praised Honors, saying his 'funny videos' were stress relievers" and who was "'shocked' by the news stories about her former executive officer."</p>

<p>Commissioned leaders are not valued for their ability to entertain or relieve stress; they certainly are not charged with creating hostile work environments, especially where they sail, ride, jump, or walk into harm's way.  They are supposed to be professionals dedicated to the profession of arms. As members of a profession, they engage in a career dedicated to knowledge and skill expertise gained by formal education and long-term experience in the workplace, validated by formal examinations and credentials.  They also dedicate themselves to a "career commitment and a closed community with strong feelings of loyalty," and "have their careers controlled by accession, assignment, and promotion based on competence," and, in no small part, are subject to "a formal code of law and ethics developed, maintained, and applied by the profession." The Navy has concluded that Capt. Honors' actions were prejudicial to good order and discipline.  This is not some politically correct, management-speak concept.  Effective, confident military forces that fight and win wars and sustain peace always depend upon the cohesive nature of good order and discipline. The Department of Defense generally considers conduct as "prejudicial to good order and discipline" if it calls into question a service member's objectivity, results in actual or an appearance of preferential treatment, undermines authority, and compromises the chain of command. </p>

<p>Capt. Honors' Navy owes its traditions of exemplary adherence to law and ethics to John Adams, who drafted the first "exemplary conduct" standards for Continental Navy and Army forces approved by the Continental Congress.  The first Article of the 1775 "Rules for the Regulation of the Navy of the United Colonies of North-America," mandated "exemplary conduct" for Navy leaders. Article XLVII of the 1775 American Articles of War forbade officers from "behaving in a scandalous, infamous manner." The rules also called for publishing details of "the crime, name, place of abode, and punishment of the delinquent ... in the news papers, in and about the camp, and of that colony from which the offender came, or usually resides: after which it shall be deemed scandalous in any officer to associate with him." In 1956, Congress re-codified the Navy's 1775 Rules, but it wasn't until 1997 that the same Preface quotes the Senate Armed Services Committee's "legislative intent" behind the "exemplary conduct" standard. The standard would "not prevent an officer from shunning responsibility or accountability for an action or event" but instead would "establish a very clear standard by which Congress and the nation can measure officers of our military services." Congress "holds military officers to a higher standard than other members of society ... [and] the nation deserves complete integrity, moral courage, and the highest moral and ethical conduct."</p>

<p>So what exactly is the standard of "exemplary conduct?" The language of the Exemplary Conduct Statute (10 U.S.C. S. 5947, with other service analogues at different sections), reads as follows: </p>

<p>"All commanding officers and others in authority in the naval service are required-- (1) to show in themselves a good example of virtue, honor, patriotism, and subordination; (2) to be vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons who are placed under their command; (3) to guard against and suppress all dissolute and immoral practices, and to correct, according to the laws and regulations of the navy, all persons who are guilty of them; and (4) to take all necessary and proper measures, under the laws, regulations, and customs of the naval service, to promote and safeguard the morale, the physical well- being, and the general welfare of the officers and enlisted persons under their command or charge."</p>

<p>Commissioned officers must ensure that they have not misunderstood or misinterpreted or been erroneously informed of illegality, immorality, or unethical conduct, but where they find it, their oath of office, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), along with the Exemplary Conduct Statute will legally compel them to "do the right thing." <br />
They lead by example. They stop illegal, immoral, or unethical practices from taking place in the first place. They report those matters that they know to be illegal, immoral, or unethical, using the tools, traditions, institutions, and channels of communication available to us within the chain of command. In the instance of multinational, coalitional, or interagency operations, to include the Department of Defense as a whole, there are often reporting and resolution mechanisms beyond the immediate chain of command but which should be approached only upon "exhaustion of remedy" at initial and subsequent echelons of reporting or resolution.</p>

<p>As a last resort, when Commissioned Officers find themselves irreconcilably incapable of discharging the duties of the office upon which they have entered, they may - and should - resign their office. Amongst others, General Robert E. Lee chose to do this, saying: </p>

<blockquote>With all my devotion to the Union and the feeling of loyalty and duty of an American citizen, I have not been able to make up my mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home. I have therefore resigned my commission in the Army, and save in defense of my native State, with the sincere hope that my poor services may never be needed, I hope I may never be called on to draw my sword.</blockquote>

<p>History has and will continue to judge the judgment exercised towards that end.</p>

<p>Sir Winston Churchill never said that "[t]he only traditions of the Royal Navy are rum, sodomy and the lash." His assistant, Sir Anthony Montague-Browne rebutted that Churchill ever said this oft-repeated, and unfair characterization of past Naval tradition. What is certain about today's modern American Navy, as well as the other Armed Forces, is that military leaders more than ever must be arbiters and role models of exemplary conduct in every instance, location, and situation.  They must be part of the solution to prevent and to prosecute sexual assault and sexual harassment in the armed forces.  They now must also find ways to implement - with dignity and respect for all service members - the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (H.R. 2965, S. 4023); that law repeals law and policy from 1993 onward (10 U.S.C. S. 654) that had prevented openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the U.S. military. When those in command cannot or have not demonstrated exemplary conduct, they, too, may be held accountable like Capt. Honors, or should resign their commissions like General Lee. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=4860231"><strong>Bob Edgar</strong></a> [President and CEO, <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/">Common Cause</a>]: "The fall of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay is a well-timed warning to the House's new GOP leaders &#8212; and Democrats too &#8212; about what can happen when lawmakers put themselves and their pursuit of power above the law.<br />
                <br />
                DeLay, once known in Washington as "The Hammer," was the Capitol's foremost practitioner of scorched-earth politics before scandals forced him into retirement in 2006. He continues to insist there was nothing improper about his involvement in a <a href= /paperchase/2011/01/delay-receives-three-year-sentence-for-money-laundering-and-conspiracy.php>scheme to funnel corporate contributions</a> to Republican candidates in his home state of Texas, where corporate campaign spending is illegal.</p>

                <p>Mr. DeLay argues that many people in politics move money around as he did to skirt campaign finance laws and that they get away with it. He has a point, but the judge and jury have properly answered it by insisting that the law be enforced.</p>

                <p>The new Republican-led House has a chance to show that it's learned the lesson of the DeLay era. Its leaders should take a fresh look at proposals like the DISCLOSE Act and the Fair Elections Now Act, which would bring greater transparency to campaign finance and reduce candidates' dependence on corporate and other special interest donations."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kyrsten Sinema [Senator, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov">Arizona State Legislature</a>]: "As an Arizonan, I was outraged when I learned of planned protests at the funerals of the victims of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html">January 8 shooting</a> that killed six and wounded 17. The families of nine-year old Christina Taylor Green and Judge John Roll deserve to grieve in peace.</p>

                <p>When I learned of the planned protests, Arizona had no law established regulating protests near funerals, so we began to look at other state statutes that had successfully addressed this issue in the past. As an attorney who specializes in constitutional law, I wanted to craft legislation that respects the First Amendment rights of protesters, while also providing a measure of peace and security for grieving families. We settled on language similar to Ohio's law. The <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3767.30">Ohio statute</a> was recently upheld in the Sixth Circuit court.</p>

                <p>Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/sb1101s.pdf">new law</a> [PDF] requires that protesters and picketers stand at least 300 feet from the location of a funeral during, one hour before, and one hour after a funeral service. The penalty for violating this law is a class one misdemeanor. We believe that this law represents a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on the protesters' right to assemble and speak freely. We also feel confident that our statute will survive constitutional scrutiny if it faces challenges in court.</p>

                <p>I am grateful to my colleagues in the Arizona Legislature for supporting this <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-passes-emergency-law-prohibiting-funeral-protests.php">emergency legislation</a>. As I attended the beautiful services for Christina Taylor Green, there was no disruption. Tomorrow and into the future, we will have some comfort in knowing that grieving families will be able to grieve in peace."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.duihua.org/about/staff.htm><strong>Joshua Rosenzweig</strong></a> [Senior Manager of Research and Hong Kong Operations, <a href=http://www.duihua.org/>The Dui Hua Foundation</a>]: The past several years have been frustrating ones for those who hoped that growing international engagement with China would result in improvements in human rights in that country. While there is no question that economic and social development have brought substantial improvements in living standards for many Chinese, it is also clear that progress in the area of <a href=/paperchase/2011/01/china-fails-to-deliver-on-human-rights-promises-hrw.php>civil and political rights has not kept pace</a>. In particular, earlier momentum in the area of legal reform and rule-of-law development has stalled, and there has been an ongoing and fierce crackdown against government critics, rights defenders, and members of ethnic minority groups.</p>

                <p>When <a href=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/china-releases-human-rights-action-plan-20090413-a4p6.html>China issued</a> its <a href=http://english.gov.cn/official/2009-04/13/content_1284128.htm>National Human Rights Action Plan</a> for 2009-2010, I said I thought it represented an important step. Making concrete, public commitments would, in theory, make it possible to measure progress and hold the government accountable for any shortcomings. In light of this, I expressed disappointment that the plan offered so little in the way of establishing specific benchmarks -- particularly with respect to civil and political rights -- and stuck to language that was more vague aspiration than positive commitment.</p>

                <p>This initial skepticism about the plan has unfortunately been borne out. These have not been good years for human rights in China, as the assessment by <a href=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/11/china-human-rights-action-plan-fails-deliver>Human Rights Watch</a> makes clear. The root of the problem is simple: China's leadership governs according to the principle of "stability above all else." Though it exudes confidence in its dealings with the outside world, the central government sees mounting signs of instability at home in the form of petitioners seeking redress for grievances, growing numbers of "mass incidents," eruption of long-simmering ethnic tensions in Tibet and Xinjiang, and the messy, hard-to-control Internet, with its channels for expression of critical opinion and transmission of uncensored news. In an atmosphere in which local authorities and security forces are given extensive leeway to enforce <a href=http://www.duihuahrjournal.org/2011/01/translation-escaping-stability-quagmire.html>stability</a>, protection and elaboration of individual rights are often pushed aside.</p>

                <p>Under these circumstances, one cannot avoid questioning whether even some of the more positive steps China has taken to achieve some of the goals in the NHRAP will have much of an impact. New rules took effect in July 2010 promised to exclude illegally-obtained <a href=http://www.duihua.org/hrjournal/evidence/evidence.htm>evidence</a> -- including confessions obtained through use of torture -- from capital cases. The case of <a href=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/index.phpd?showsingle=146224>Fan Qihang</a>, executed in September despite strong evidence suggesting that his confession had been coerced by police investigators, immediately cast doubt on courts' will to enforce these new rules aimed at combating torture and protecting defendants' procedural rights. A vaunted but largely symbolic revision to the Criminal Law that would limit use of the <a href=http://www.duihuahrjournal.org/2010/09/translation-commentary-greater-steps.html>death penalty</a> has faced strong opposition out of law-and-order concerns, despite the fact that it would likely do little to reduce China's staggering number of executions.</p>

                <p>There is cause for some optimism, but this has less to do with steps taken by the government and more to do with the increasingly vocal force of domestic public opinion, as expressed through the media and on the Internet. After years of targeting by international human rights NGOs, there was a breakthrough in late 2009 when the illegal detention of petitioners in <a href=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/11/02/china-secret-black-jails-hide-severe-rights-abuses >"black jails"</a> suddenly began to be investigated by the Chinese press. Public opinion has also been exposing and pushing back against forced demolition, the deaths of police detainees, and the use of criminal defamation charges to silence critics of local government wrongdoing. If these public voices are given more space to exert oversight over government, there is hope that China will be pushed further to fulfill the commitments made in this and future human rights action plans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Well-timed lifting of travel restrictions marks improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JFKsmithW.htm>Dr. Wayne Smith</a></strong> [Senior Fellow and Director of Cuba Program, <a href=http://www.ciponline.org>Center for International Policy</a>]: "U.S.-Cuba relations changed little during 2010, and certainly showed no signs of significant improvement. On the contrary, the two sides seemed to be in something of a stalemate, with the U.S. taking the apparent position that it  could not take steps to improve relations until the <a href=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/02/11/what-was-alan-gross-doing-in-havana>matter of Alan Gross</a> was resolved -- Mr. Gross being the USAID contractor arrested in December of 2009. The U.S. maintained that he had committed no crime. The Cubans, on the other hand, noted that Mr. Gross had entered Cuba improperly and had been distributing highly sophisticated radio equipment without a license.
                <p>Although no charges have been filed against Mr. Gross, Cuban officials privately hinted that a step would have to be taken on the U.S. side in order for the case to be fully resolved. That step finally came on January 14 of 2011, when the White House announced an <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php>easing of the restrictions</a> on the travel of U.S. students and religious groups to Cuba, in addition to granting permission of limited remittances from U.S. citizens to Cubans.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the White House announcement came only days after a meeting of U.S. and Cuban delegations in Havana at which, reportedly, the Cubans were "responsive" on the Gross case. We will see what that means, but the expectations are that Gross will be charged and then released during the weeks ahead. If so, the way may then be clear for some significant improvement in relations.</p>
                <p>And meanwhile, restrictions on travel have been eased. All to the good. Those restrictions have long since been counterproductive and should have been eliminated decades ago. One does not, after all, bring about change in what has been something of a closed society by keeping it closed. The best way to encourage the kind of change we'd like to see in Cuba is by encouraging the free flow of citizens between the two countries, and of course, the free flow of information. Hopefully, we are now at long last moving in that direction. Obviously, the next goal should be to remove travel restrictions altogether."</p>

		<title>Obama&#039;s liberalization of Cuba travel regulations a step towards deeper engagement</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/wleogra.cfm>William M. LeoGrande</a> [Dean, <a href=http://www.american.edu/spa/>School of Public Affairs at American University</a>]: "President Obama's <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php>new regulations liberalizing travel to Cuba</a> represent a key step forward in his policy of engagement. The new regulations eliminate the barriers to academic, educational, and cultural exchange imposed by President George W. Bush in 2003 and 2004. Those barriers eliminated most contact with Cuban civil society, which had expanded significantly under President Bill Clinton.
                <p>President Obama came to office having criticized U.S. policy toward Cuba for fifty years of failure, and promising to try something different. His goal was to improve inter-government relations by engaging in dialogue on issues of mutual interest, expanding people-to-people contacts, and creating conditions to encourage political and economic reform on the island. As <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php>first steps</a>, in April 2009, he effectively eliminated all restrictions on Cuban-Americans' right to travel to Cuba and to send remittances to family members. In May, he invited the Cuban government to resume regular diplomatic dialogue on immigration and other issues, an offer which Cuba accepted. </p>
                <p>To the dismay of many supporters, however, the president did not roll back the Bush restrictions on people-to-people engagement at the same time he did it for Cuban-Americans. This created an anomalous situation in which Cuban-Americans could travel to Cuba freely, but other U.S. citizens and residents could not. As has so often been the case, domestic politics and opposition from Cuban-American members of Congress seemed to present an insurmountable obstacle to the president's own prescription to try a new approach to Cuba. To minimize the political costs, President Obama quietly expanded academic and cultural exchanges during his first two years in office by simply granting licenses more liberally than his predecessor, rather than by changing the regulations. But the Bush regulations were so onerous that few U.S. academic institutions could operate in Cuba, and no educational travel at all was allowed outside of colleges and universities. </p>
                <p>The new travel regulations announced this month essentially reinstate the Clinton era regulations on educational and cultural exchange, allowing non-governmental organizations like National Geographic to conduct educational trips to Cuba. If the experience of the Clinton years is any indicator, tens of thousands of U.S. citizens will take advantage of these opportunities annually. For colleges and universities, the new regulations go even farther, granting a general license for academic programs in Cuba and eliminating the logistical obstacles that the Bush regulations had imposed to suppress these programs. Only a handful of universities -- including my own <a href=http://www.worldcapitals.american.edu/enclave/cuba.cfm>American University</a> -- managed to maintain study abroad programs in Cuba during the Bush years. Now, dozens of new programs will spring up and hundreds or even thousands more students will have an opportunity to study in Cuba.</p>
                <p>Promulgating the new regulations required a degree of political courage in the face of <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D_hwusHDKY>opposition from Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ),</a> to whom Obama has looked for advice on policy toward Latin America in general and Cuba in particular. In the House of Representatives, the president faces a Republican majority that puts Cuban-American Ileana Ros Lehtinen (R-Fl) in the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, where she can cause no end of mischief for the president's foreign policy. The inability of Congressional Democrats to change the law on tourist travel to Cuba -- which they tried to do in 2010 when they were in the majority -- signals that even among Democrats, a more open policy toward Cuba has its critics. Finally, the ongoing imprisonment of U.S. AID contractor Alan Gross for entering Cuba illegally to distribute satellite cell phones to dissidents, makes any policy opening vulnerable to accusations of being "soft."</p>
                <p>On the other hand, momentous changes are underway in Cuba, and the lack of response from the Obama administration during 2010 gave the impression that the United States really had no policy at all other than to continue, by dint of inertia, the policies of the past. In July 2010, the Cuban government engaged in a dialogue with the Catholic Church that resulted in the release of 52 political prisoners -- almost everyone identified by Amnesty International as a <a href=http://www.amnesty.org/en/node/17527>prisoner of conscience</a>. In September, President Raúl Castro announced that the state sector of the economy would shrink almost immediately by 10 percent, and that most of the resulting unemployment would have to be absorbed by growth in the private sector. The Cubans also announced plans for a Congress of the Cuban Communist Party in April 2011 which will dramatically restructure Cuba's economy-- changes that reminded many observers of the early stages of China's economic transformation.</p>
                <p>Most specialists on Cuba believe that the island has embarked on a path of fundamental change. Washington risks becoming irrelevant to that process unless President Obama is willing to engage with Cuba more deeply than he has so far. The new travel regulations show that the president still believes engagement is the right strategy, and that he is willing to pay at least some political price in order to pursue it. Change in Cuba will be determined first and foremost by conditions on the island, but the international environment Cuba faces will also shape that process. The United States can play a positive role through deeper engagement, or it can stand on the sidelines. "We've been engaged in a failed policy with Cuba for the last 50 years, and we need to change it," Barack Obama declared during the presidential campaign. He was right, and now he needs to get on with it."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sara Burhan Abdullah, Pitt Law LLM '08 and JD '11, was a judge at the Iraqi National Rounds for the Jessup International Moot Court Competition. She shares her impressions of Iraqi students and judges' performance...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> was invited to judge the Iraqi National Rounds for the Jessup International Moot Court Competition, held in December of 2010. Though Iraq has participated in the competition before, this was its first true national round, and about fifteen law schools participated. The experience was a remarkable one. The well-run competition was an example of how quickly transnational legal skills can be transplanted across different legal systems and cultures.</p>

<p><img alt="Iraq_Jessup_1.jpg" title="Sara Burhan Abdullah, Luke A. Mclaurin, and Ali Shaker Al-Khuzaii judge the semi-final round between University of Sulaymaniya and University of Baghdad law schools." src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Iraq_Jessup_1.jpg" width="320" height="213" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />The Jessup Competition is an International Moot Court competition designed to improve both law students' skills in making arguments before courts and their ability to understand the different concepts of public international law. The Jessup Moot takes the form of a mock proceeding before the International Court of Justice between two fictional countries, with each country being represented by a single law school in each round. The international competition is held in the spring of each year in Washington, DC, and many nations, including the United States, hold preliminary national rounds to determine which of their many teams will qualify for international participation. For security and other reasons, Iraq had not been able to hold a national round until this year. However, through the private efforts of University of Pittsburgh law professor Haider Ala Hamoudi and the funding support of the United States Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq had sent a team from either Suleymania's law school or Basra's law school to previous international competitions.</p>

<p>The dream of providing other Iraqi law schools with the opportunity to participate in the Jessup competition finally came true through the support of the International Human Rights Law Institute and US government funding. Everyone involved in the Jessup Competition, but especially the director of the national round, Kari Kammel, was concerned about the competition's success. The reason for the concern was that Iraq had been culturally and legally isolated for decades, and only two schools had the slightest familiarity with the Jessup competition. Nevertheless, due to the excellent efforts of Executive Director Kammel and others, the competition was an astonishing success.<br />
Having helped Dr. Hamoudi supervise and prepare the Iraqi teams at the international rounds in Washington, DC, over the past five years, I have some sense of what the competition looks like in the US and how students prepare for their rounds. I noticed a number of striking similarities between the international and Iraqi national rounds. For example, I witnessed the same combination of eagerness and nervousness among the students in Iraq as I did in Washington, DC. The students in Iraq were exchanging ideas, making arguments, and brainstorming with their coaches as to how to approach an argument. These preparations and discussions were very similar to those that take place at the international rounds in DC, and they were taking place among students who had never stepped foot out of Iraq.</p>

<p><img alt="Iraq_Jessup_2.jpg" title="A law student from University of Sulaymaniya argues before the judges" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Iraq_Jessup_2.jpg" width="320" height="213" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />In addition, I was impressed at how quickly the students were able to grasp and apply the styles and methods of legal argumentation despite limited access to necessary resources in public international law. The Iraqi students had been trained in rote memorization of limited sources and lacked any training in making arguments or developing analytical skills, so I had assumed they would memorize a brief and then be entirely unable to move beyond it if interrupted with a question. For the most part, the reverse was true--the students were most comfortable when asked questions and given the opportunity to respond. They showed considerable ability to make strong arguments despite the limitations described above. The eagerness of the Iraqi students, combined with their surprisingly strong abilities, gave me hope that the competition, and indeed public international law more broadly, has a bright future in Iraq.</p>

<p>Iraqi judges, by comparison, had a harder time adapting to the newer methods of argumentation that were presented in the Jessup competition. This was obvious by the different manner in which Iraqi judges asked questions relative to the participating foreign judges. The foreign judges were mostly former Jessup participants, international law practitioners or law professors and so had more exposure to the competition than the Iraqi judges, who were primarily composed of law professors, in addition to some actual judges. The most prominent Iraqi judge was Judge Rizgar Mohammad Amin, the first judge assigned to adjudicate the former dictator Saddam Hussein.  <br />
Because the judges were law professors in Iraq used to dealing with Iraqi law students, they properly understood the Jessup Competition to be a learning experience, and they thought it fit to question students and teach them in the manner to which the professors were accustomed. Thus, the questions directed at competitors by Iraqi judges were more formalistic inquiries into international law rather than inquiries focused on the actual argument being presented by the team. One oft-repeated question was whether it is necessary for a representative of a country before the ICJ to be a lawyer or if other individuals can appear before the international court as representatives of countries.  Another frequently asked question concerned the difference in definition between treaty and convention. Although these questions can be important under different factual scenarios, I could not see the relevance of these questions to the facts and legal issues presented in the case. The questions did not so much test the ability of the student to present the best argument, but rather how much ancillary knowledge, irrelevant to the actual case, they happened to possess.</p>

<p><img alt="Iraq_Jessup_3.jpg" title="A law student from University of Baghdad argues before the judges" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Iraq_Jessup_3.jpg" width="320" height="213" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />After a week of competing against each other, the two finalists were announced as winners and invited to participate in the international rounds. The two teams, from Baghdad and Nasiriya's law schools, are now in the process of getting ready for visa applications and interviews, which are time consuming and have threatened the viability of Iraqi participation in the past. All of us involved in the competition hope for the best this year.</p>

<p>In short, the Iraqi national rounds were a successful experience despite all the obstacles faced by the administrators and organizers of the competition. The Jessup Moot broadens the horizon of Iraqi law students by introducing them to new developments in international law around the world. It also better trains them in the arena of international law in a manner that is sure to prove beneficial to the country in the future. These consequences are fairly obvious. What was surprising was how firmly interest and desire for skills in international law took hold among these talented Iraqi law students, despite their isolation, lack of resources and absence of sufficient training.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UNITED STATES: The Danger of Highly Politicized Country Conditions in an Asylum Case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christian Ohanian, University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel-Hill Law '11, is a certified legal student at the University of North Carolina's Immigration and Human Rights Policy Clinic. He writes about the difficulty confronting asylum applicants from politically controversial states...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>raq has been embroiled in sectarian violence and general social upheaval since the United States' invasion in 2003. Often lost in the headlines are the stories of individuals whose lives are radically altered and endangered by the current conditions in Iraq. Many of these people seek asylum in various countries, including the United States. However, those who have been persecuted, with their lives severely threatened, have found themselves subsumed as unwitting victims in the politics and foreign policy that surround the current circumstances in Iraq. In my short time practicing immigration law as a certified law student in the University of North Carolina School of Law Immigration and Human Rights Policy Clinic, I have had to face difficult issues that often arise in asylum law when a client's story is inseparable from politicized foreign policy and news headlines. </p>

<p>While working in the clinic, I represented an Iraqi citizen who was seeking asylum in the United States. He built a life and raised a family in Iraq long before Saddam Hussein came into power. Shortly after Saddam assumed power, my client left his job in the Iraqi government and found work in the private sector. Years later, Hussein and his government became a focal point for American foreign policy and eventually their actions were considered to be the impetus for an invasion of Iraq. My client became the target of many violent sectarian groups, who found post-invasion Iraq fertile ground for their missions of persecution. </p>

<p>As I began my research, I quickly realized that the facts, stories, stigmas, and policies surrounding Iraq and the US invasion would be impossible to evade in my evaluation of the case. As an asylum applicant under legitimate threat as a targeted professional in Iraq, one would believe that my client's case should be permitted to stand on its own--distinct from every ill-conceived stigma, overarching policy generalization, or "muddied" fact scenario. In my work thus far, it has become a sobering reality that such is not the case.</p>

<p>The bigger picture of US involvement in Iraq was an unavoidable reality in the representation of my client. His time spent working in the pre-invasion Iraqi government presented the first difficulty. It is hard to imagine an immigration officer being able to divorce his thinking from pre-conceived and policy-tinged notions regarding the subject, no matter how mundane my client's position in the former government.</p>

<p>Furthermore, after the first set of deadly threats to his life my client fled to Syria, raising another complicated issue. Relations between the US and Syria are strained and mutually suspicious at best. My client is a simple man removed from any political involvement with either country. Yet, an immigration officer would probably look with skepticism at a significant amount of time spent in Syria after fleeing Iraq. Unfortunately, the time my client spent at a border town near Syria seems to ensnare his story in overarching US foreign policy and political issues. This border town was under the influence of insurgent groups, including Al Qaeda. These insurgent groups are not only vigorously targeted by the US military but are also featured in numerous news headlines and foreign policy articles that reported on circumstances in Iraq.</p>

<p>Does it matter? How un-deservedly "tainted" does the client's story become? How restricted does a client find himself due to the unfortunate reality that his story of persecution intersects with broader security matters of concern to the US government? Is it really possible, however necessary, for an immigration officer to impartially separate the individual client from such high profile stories implicating US foreign policy and security concerns? </p>

<p>The precarious nature of the "bigger picture" of politicized facts that can "muddy the waters" of a client's story necessarily lead to corresponding counseling decisions. When does an applicant's story intersect with too many potentially un-appealing politicized facts? When does that intersection indicate a necessity to re-appraise the strength of the client's case?<br />
 <br />
A reviewing asylum officer certainly has to take into account the larger context when evaluating an individual applicant's story. However, I fear that in some cases the larger context of well-known stories, facts, groups, leaders, and policy concerns could jeopardize the fair disposition of an individual applicant's case. It seems all too likely that in highly politicized circumstances, the individual's story of persecution could fall victim to the inescapable influence of overarching perceptions, supposed policy concerns, stories, fears, stigmas, and other distorting influences. How do we draw the line between appropriate country conditions pertaining to an asylum applicant and security concerns based on over-politicized and possibly distorting facts? Highly publicized stories and stigmas create a legitimate risk that an asylum officer could be unduly influenced in the evaluation of an individual asylum application.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wisc.edu/profiles/trochev@wisc.edu">Alexei Trochev</a> of the University of Wisconsin Law School says judicial dependence in Ukraine did not begin with Yanukovych and it will not end with his departure from politics because Yanukovych's successor will also adapt the judiciary for his or her own needs and constitutional rules are in favor of the powerful president....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img alt="Alexei_Trochev.jpg" src="/forum/trochev_alexei_200.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>n September 2010, the <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/index">Constitutional Court of Ukraine</a> declared unconstitutional the <a href="http://wnu-ukraine.com/files/constitutional_court.pdf">2004 constitutional reform</a> [PDF] that restored the <a href="http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm">1996 Constitution</a> as of the day of the judgment and ordered all state agencies to bring legislation in compliance with that Constitution. In an instant, Ukraine's president received unilateral powers to nominate candidates for prime minister (without parliamentary ratification), appoint cabinet ministers, to dismiss the government without parliamentary approval, and to cancel any government resolution. While the critics quickly condemn this ruling as a sign of the judicial dependence that destroyed Ukrainian democracy, they fail to ask why the Court did it now and why fiercely competitive politics lead to a pliant judiciary. The Ukrainian case shows that fragmentation of political power, gridlocked governments, and vibrant elections are not automatic guarantees for either judicial independence or the supremacy of national constitutions.</p>

<p><strong>Tainted Constitution-Making</strong></p>

<p>To experts in Ukraine's law and politics, this ruling was not surprising. As former Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.ccu.gov.ua/en/publish/article/11648">Justice Volodymyr Voznyuk</a> said, it was just a matter of time before the constitutional reform were to be repealed by the Constitutional Court. The 2004 constitutional reform was adopted in violation of constitutional procedure and the judicial invalidation of this reform is easier than constitution-making in a fractured parliament. The Constitutional Court on many occasions struck down laws on the grounds of parliament's noncompliance with constitutionally prescribed law-making procedures, regardless of how minor these violations were.</p>

<p>The 2004 constitutional reform was a product of Ukraine's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4061253.stm">Orange Revolution</a>, a month-long, street-level, peaceful protest over fraudulent presidential elections, during which the outgoing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2283925.stm">President Leonid Kuchma</a> handpicked prime minister <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/president_biography.html">Vyktor Yanukovych</a> to be his successor. Kuchma later reneged and, under the watchful eye of the mediators from the European Union, he negotiated with the opposition candidate <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm">Viktor Yushchenko</a> [BBC profile]  to transfer power from the presidency to parliament and the prime minister via constitutional amendments. These amendments would place the prime minister, who would be elected by the parliament's ruling coalition, in charge of appointing cabinet ministers and most day-to-day executive policy-making. According to <a href="http://www.ssees.ucl.ac.uk/prospect/wilson.htm">Andrew Wilson</a>, Kuchma insisted on amending the constitution in order to transform the parliament into a safe haven for his cronies. He threatened not to sign any changes to the elections law that would allow any kind of re-run of elections, which in effect denied Yushchenko an election victory. Yushchenko agreed to constitutional reform because he was sure that his party would win upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for early 2006, and would then reform the constitution according to his wishes. Meanwhile, Yanukovych felt deeply humiliated and betrayed. </p>

<p>The parliament adopted the constitutional reform with 402 out of 450 parliamentary votes and declared that the constitutional changes were to take effect January 1, 2006. President Kuchma immediately signed the constitutional amendments and the changes to elections law, even though Articles 155 and 159 of the 1996 constitution required that the constitutional reform bills to be passed by at least 300 votes, twice at consecutive parliamentary sessions, and approved by the Constitutional Court prior to their adoption. There is no doubt that he knew he could have followed the constitutionally mandated procedure: he enjoyed a friendly parliament and constitutional court and both institutions showed that they would act quickly upon his wishes. He chose not to, knowing that these violations could be later used as a pretext for appealing unfavorable court judgments. Yushchenko did not object, as he had no time for respecting constitutional subtleties. As a result of this tainted constitution-making, Yushchenko won the re-run of the runoff vote with only 52 per cent of the vote against Yanukovych's 44 per cent, despite much friendlier media coverage and much cleaner, fairer and free elections.</p>

<p><strong>Only the Election Winners Wanted to Reverse the 2004 Constitutional Reform</strong></p>

<p>Following this crucially important yet weak electoral victory, both Yushchenko and Tymoshenko criticized the 2004 constitutional reform at every corner. On December 27, 2005, the National Commission for Strengthening Democracy and Asserting the Rule of Law, which consisted of 30 respected jurists and headed by then Justice Minister Serhiy Holovatyi, declared two holdings. First, the way in which the 2004 constitutional reform bill was adopted violated Article 159 of the 1996 Constitution and therefore was null and void from the moment of its adoption. Second, the Constitutional Court had the power to strike down this bill  as unconstitutional at any time. At the same time, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/default.asp">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a> expressed <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta05/ERES1466.htm">concern about the validity</a> of the 2004 constitutional reform. Then Prime Minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/page/about">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> campaigned to reverse the 2004 constitutional reform via national referendum (a move Yushchenko opposed at the time) and repeatedly threatened to challenge constitutionality of the 2004 constitutional reform in the Constitutional Court. She had her eyes on winning next presidential elections and did not want to rush the reversal until she would secure presidency.</p>

<p>However, the winners of the Orange Revolution were unable to return to the 1996 Constitution for three reasons. Tthey fought bitter inter-personal battles and lost popular support. Also, they lacked 300 votes in the parliament, which are required for amending the constitution. And finally, they did not have support of 10 justices of the Constitutional Court, a minimum number required to declare laws unconstitutional. Meanwhile, the loser of the Orange Revolution, Yanukovych's party, succeeded in paralyzing the Constitutional Court. Fortunately for Yanukovych, the nine-year terms of the sitting constitutional court justices expired in 2005. His party successfully blocked the appointment of the new justices until the fall of 2006 when it managed to assemble ruling majority, appoint Yanukovych as prime-minister and ban the Constitutional Court from reviewing the constitutionality of the 2004 constitutional reform. Yanukovych's party was quite comfortable in functioning under the 2004 constitutional reform and was not interested in bringing back a powerful presidency unless Yanukovych were to become president. The 2004 constitution lasted as long as it did only because none of the three key rival political groups were able to bring back the 1996 Constitution.</p>

<p><strong>Judicial Dependence in Highly Competitive Politics</strong></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, when Yanukovych won the 2010 presidential election with 49 per cent of the vote against Tymoshenko's 45 percent, he set his sights on bringing back the 1996 Constitution with the help of the Constitutional Court. In July 2010, 252 legislators, who were members of his party, petitioned the Constitutional Court to declare the 2004 constitutional reform unconstitutional. And when the Court promptly obliged, after a three-hour televised public hearing in which nobody supported constitutional reform, and a week of judicial deliberations behind closed doors, the election losers, like Tymoshenko and Yushchenko, blasted the Court for destroying Ukraine's democracy. How and why did Yanukovych, who many thought would disappear from Ukraine's high politics after the defeat in the Orange Revolution, succeed where his rivals failed? The answer that does not help is that the Constitutional Court became a rubber-stamp institution for President Yanukovych, who wanted a return to the 1996 Constitution with its expanded presidential powers. </p>

<p>Yanukovych succeeded because he had improved techniques for keeping the Constitutional Court under control, which had already been developed by his rivals and predecessors. Packing the Court was necessary to ensure a pro-Yanukovych majority because his predecessors proved that replacing maverick judges with loyal ones is the safest ways to ensure that the Court would not cause problems for the election winners. </p>

<p>In February 2008, the Constitutional Court threw out the constitutional review petition of 102 legislators The Court reasoned that the 2004 constitutional amendments had entered in force and became an integral part of the constitution. As a result, the Court had no jurisdiction over the constitutionality of constitutional norms. </p>

<p>However, following Yushchenko's dismissal of three Justices on dubious constitutional grounds and packing of the Court with three new justices, the Constitutional Court diametrically reversed its position in June 2008. Acting on the petition of 47 legislators from Yushchenko's party, the Court declared that it had jurisdiction over constitutional amendments, which had already entered in force. This judge-made reversal opened the door for the judicial invalidation of the 2004 constitutional reform well before it became clear that Yanukovych would win presidency. The Orange coalition should blame itself for failing to return the 1996 Constitution.</p>

<p>Judicial dependence in Ukraine did not begin with Yanukovych and it will not end with his departure from politics. As <a href="http://www.crees.bham.ac.uk/staff/wolczuk/index.shtml">Kataryna Wolczuk</a> has shown, the young Constitutional Court during the dominant power politics of Kuchma's presidency appeased the executive branch in order to stay alive. However, as I have argued, since the 2004 Orange Revolution judicial dependence and pressure on the Constitutional Court and other courts only broadened and deepened. Politicians of all stripes and top government officials capture courts and brag about bribing judges when there is highly competitive politics and gridlocked government. This is because the rulers bear no costs for pressuring judges, yet they reap substantial benefits from pliant judiciary. And it shows that Ukraine lacks real rule of law. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court (and the rest of the judiciary) failed to build long-term alliances, as neither lawyers nor civil society nor politicians listened to the litany of the Justices' complaints about political pressure. Key political groups used the tribunal as a constraint on their rivals, not on themselves. It survived the feckless pluralism of Yushchenko's presidency only because it catered to the short-term power needs of political rivals. The Court will survive Yanukovych's regime if only to provide golden parachutes for important people with law degrees and to serve as a symbol of Ukraine's independence. Yanukovych's successor will adapt the Court for her or his own needs. Until then, constitutional supremacy and rigidity will matter because constitutional rules are in favor of the powerful president. This is still much better than the fate of the Constitutional Court of Kyrgyzstan, which was abolished in June 2010 and whose judges are now facing criminal charges for repealing the constitutional amendments, which had been adopted in November 2006 and limited the powers of the ousted President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/full_time.cfm?facid=19">Victor Hansen</a> and <a href="http://www.nesl.edu/faculty/full_time.cfm?facid=15">Lawrence Friedman</a> of New England School of Law say if Congress wants to reverse the recent trend of being a bystander to critical national security policymaking, it must work with the president to create a structure to guide his decision-making process....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody <tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/victor_hansen.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/lawrence_friedman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he New York Times recently reported that the Obama administration plans to establish a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/us/22gitmo.html?_r=2">periodic review process</a> for certain detainees currently being held without trial at Guantanamo.  As a candidate and early in his administration, President Obama maintained that Congress should pass legislation that would give the President the authority to detain terrorism detainees indefinitely without trial.  In May 2009, however, he changed his position, arguing that the <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/terrorism/sjres23.htm">2001 Authorization to Use Military Force</a> (AUMF) provides the President the authority he needs to detain these terrorism suspects without trial.</p>

<p>The President's change in position likely results from Congressional opposition to trying terrorism suspects in federal court in the United States, as well as opposition to closing Guantanamo and moving all of the detainees to the United States. In the new Congress, there are likely to be several bills introduced that would prevent the President from moving any of the detainees to the United States or trying them in federal court.</p>

<p>In light of this continued opposition, President Obama is seeking to bypass Congress and establish some legal structure for periodic review of detainees by means of an executive order.  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama is not claiming that he has the exclusive authority to decide these matters. Rather, he is opting for this approach because Congress is unwilling to give him the legislative authorization that he initially hoped for. Nonetheless, at the end of the day his approach is likely to lead us to the same place as his predecessor's: to executive policymaking independent of Congress, supported by claims of exclusive constitutional authority to decide these vital questions of national security and individual freedoms.  </p>

<p>This result can and should be avoided. Members of the new Congress should embrace the framers' intention and jointly participate in national security decisions with the President.  Now is the time for Congress to accept this shared responsibility and begin to act like an equal partner in this process. Its failure to do so will, when all is said and done, continue a dangerous precedent and ultimately weaken its position.  </p>

<p>Members of Congress who are critical of the President's proposals need to accept at least two facts. First, with respect to where detainees should be tried, members should note that many terrorism suspects have been successfully prosecuted in federal courts. The expertise of the judges trying those cases, and the government attorneys prosecuting them, is certainly sufficient to address the cases against the remaining detainees at Guantanamo.</p>

<p>Second, members of Congress should note how much the very existence of the Guantanamo facility has undermined United States efforts in the war on terror. As General David Petraeus, who commanded the multi-national force in Iraq, has remarked that the closure of Guantanamo will help the American military's counterinsurgency efforts in the Middle East by eliminating an <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35493976/ns/meet_the_press/">important recruiting symbol for jihadists</a>.  Continuing to hold these detainees at Guantanamo indefinitely and without a clear legal structure and periodic review of their detention simply will not advance our national security interests.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why members of Congress who oppose the President on political grounds would also oppose him on policy grounds. Demagoguery about terrorists incarcerated in local prisons is just the kind of rhetoric that inflames passions and solidifies election-year support. But the election is over.  Now it is time for Congress to enact a legal framework to regulate the indefinite incarceration of terrorism suspects and to guide the President's prosecutorial discretion. In the interests of both justice and security, Congress should determine where these suspects should be tried and how they should be held accountable for their actions, if found guilty.</p>

<p>If Congress continues to play politics by opposing any policy regarding terrorism suspects that the Obama administration proposes, then the President is likely to follow in the steps of his predecessor and seek to accomplish his goals without involving Congress.  If Congress wants to reverse the recent trend of being a bystander to critical, national security policymaking, it must work with the President to create a structure to guide his decision-making process.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L. Ali Khan</a>, Professor of Law at Washburn University says the people's revolutions of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt are in response to sham democracies and their peoples' desire to enforce their rights and liberties, but the US's role remains unclear...<br /><hrheight="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/khan-ali.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0"vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he peoples' revolution is brewing in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt. These nations, unlike the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, have established state constitutions that promise a democratic form of government and espouse the principle of popular sovereignty. Article 3 of the Tunisia Constitution declares that "The sovereignty belongs to the Tunisian People who exercise it in conformity with the Constitution."Article 4 of the Yemen Constitution declares that "Power rests with the people who are the source of all powers." Article 3 of the Egypt Constitution proclaims that "Sovereignty is for the people alone who are the source of authority." Invoking these constitutional provisions, the people of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt have resolved to enforce their democratic rights and liberties. </p>

<p>In blatant violation of national constitutions, President Zain El-Abidine Ben Ali ruled Tunisia for twenty four years (1987-2011), President Ali Abdul Saleh of Yemen has been in power for over twenty years (1990-2011), and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has occupied the highest state office for thirty years (1981-2011).  The people have finally elected to recall these irremovable Presidents by resorting to street power, the ultimate expression of sovereignty against tyranny. The reasoning of the peoples' revolution is no other but the one that has inspired other revolutions: "When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce (the people) under absolute despotism, it is (the people's) right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security." The peoples of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt can no longer tolerate sham democracies.</p>

<p><strong>Sham Democracies</strong></p>

<p>It is commonplace in North Africa and the Middle East to establish irremovable autocracies through the medium of sham democracy. Over the decades, sham periodic elections have been held in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt to elect parliaments and presidents. However, the same ruling party returns to power and the same President wins an overwhelming majority of popular vote. The periodic democratic ritual is staged to delude the people and the world that the governments in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt are anchored in the will of the people. Nothing is farther from the truth.</p>

<p>In October 2009, Tunisia held sham presidential and parliamentary elections. The Constitutional Democratic Rally, the ruling party that has governed Tunisia since its independence from France in 1956, received nearly 85% of the popular vote. To conceal electoral fraud, the ruling party refused international monitoring of the elections. In Egypt, the National Democratic Party has retained power since its creation in 1978. In the most recent sham elections held in 2010, the National Democratic Party won 81% of the seats in the national legislature. Opposition parties that could have challenged the ruling party were banned and their leaders arrested.  Yemen is essentially a one party state. The next parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in April, 2011. It remains to be seen whether the Yeminis would allow the General People's Congress, the ruling party, to return to power.   </p>

<p>Even sham democracies are tolerable if rulers are competent and just. But sham democracies are doubly unbearable if the people face unremitting economic hardships. Hope is at the lowest ebb when protesters wave baguette as the symbol of revolution. In Tunisia, President Ben Ali and his family exploited state power to amass huge amounts of personal wealth. Corruption at the top trickled down to the bottom. Tunisian protests began the day a farmer set himself on fire when the police, in order to extort money, impounded his vegetable and fruit stand. Yemen, the poorest country in the region, has made little economic progress under President Saleh's incompetent administration. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak has run the state as a personal fiefdom. The members of the ruling party are blissful and affluent whereas millions of ordinary people live in shanties. Economic hardships are further aggravated when omnipresent security forces resort to cruelty, torture, and inhumane treatment. </p>

<p><strong>United States Support</strong></p>

<p>It is unclear how the United States would react to the people's revolution in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt. While the Obama administration has expressed lukewarm support for Tunisians after Ben Ali's departure, no real support is offered to the peoples of Yemen and Egypt. If history is any guide, the U.S. would give public lectures on the people's right to peaceful protest but secretly support the suppression of revolts in Yemen and Egypt. As usual, concrete U.S. interests will trump the people's right to institute representative governments. The U.S. would support President Saleh for his commitment to physically eradicate al-Qaeda, which is taking root in Yemen. Likewise, the U.S. would support President Mubarak for his commitment to suppress the Muslim Brotherhood, a religious political party that opposes U.S. policies in the Middle East. The despots have memorized the logic of American self-interest. </p>

<p>By betting on the discredited Presidents of Yemen and Egypt, however, the U.S. will choose the wrong side of the inevitable revolution. The revolution for genuine democracy, even if brutally suppressed, is unlikely to fade away. The people seem determined to enforce the national constitutions that promise free and fair elections, freedom of speech, the right to vote, and the right to remove a ruling party that no longer serves their social and economic needs. In his 2009 speech, in Cairo President Obama rejected the notion of pawning other nations for securing American interests. He said, "For human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail." Now is the time for President Obama to support the peoples of Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt in their sovereign struggle to self-enforce the democratic constitutions that have yet to deliver genuine democracy.</p>

Bogus posted a comment on CNN alleging that, "[T]here's no right of revolution in a democracy."  Surely such a Bogus admonition is not correct or preferable.  Some revolutions occur peacefully and partially through changing patterns of generally shared expectations or changes at the ballot box. The fact that a particular change, resting on general patterns of expectation or demand, occurs within a relative democracy should not be alarming to those who favor political self-determination of peoples, human rights, and the rule of authoritative law.  </p>

<p>Moreover, of course, it begs a question at stake whether a given governmental process is democratic. It is also worth noting that some of our Founders, who engaged in a notable revolution of their own, did not prefer that our federal government would be a direct democracy but a republic. Without, for example, the direct election of a President and with a balancing role of a Senate that is in potential opposition to a House with membership that is more directly representative of the human beings who make up our polity.</p>

<p>It was a Republican President in the midst of a civil war in 1861 who remarked during his First Inaugural Address that the people of the United States have a revolutionary right to overthrow their government at any time. But, he added, the Union, and not the secessionists, represented the people of the United States, or at least the majority thereof.  His sentiments reflected, of course, those of the Founders of our country, especially J.Q. Adams, Hamilton, Henry, Jefferson, Madison, Paine, and Wilson, and others in the Americas who had thrown off the yoke of foreign powers.    </p>

<p>I recall a time when Richard Nixon was on his way out, when thousands of demonstrators had already been locked up for days without trial in Washington, D.C. (something that the ACLU, which handled some of the cases, still cannot admit in view of "gag" orders imposed by the judiciary in a relative democracy).  It was a time when the New York Times reported that generals in the Pentagon had decided not to push the button merely because a democratically elected President had ordered a nuclear attack. The unelected generals would decide themselves whether there was a need to use nuclear weapons - and thank goodness for common sense.</p>

<p>A general officer told me later that President Nixon, through his Chief of Staff, had asked the Joint Chiefs whether the military would support martial law and Nixon's retention of power, although the process of impeachment had begun.  The unelected generals said, "No" - thank goodness.  It had become clear that a previously democratically elected President had lost a democratically based authority to rule. It is a lesson for us that sometimes there is a need for revolutionary refusal or confrontation in a relative democracy, even against a government that had initially been democratically elected.  Abraham Lincoln was correct.</p>

<p>And what is happening now in the Middle East, in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere?  What should our response be and that of the United Nations?  Should we continue with an ultimately failed foreign policy that prefers stability at the expense of democratic values, political self-determination of peoples, and human rights - our cherished American values evident from the time when my ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War?  Under article 55 of the United Nations Charter, every U.N. entity must promote and serve self-determination of peoples and participate in a universal respect for and observance of human rights.  These same obligations are incumbent upon state members of the U.N. through article 56 of the Charter.  Isn't it time for a revolutionary change in our foreign policy - one that reflects the values and hopes of the majority of our people and, quite obviously, numerous other peoples who seek to share a common dignity in an increasingly interdependent world?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://richardsocarides.com><strong>Richard Socarides</strong></a> [President <a href=http://equalitymatters.org>Equality Matters</a>]: "This is another important ruling from a <a href=/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-allows-state-exmployees-to-sue-for-same-sex-spouse-benefits.php>federal District Court</a> raising serious questions as to the validity of the Justice Department's defense of the federal anti-gay marriage law. </p>

                <p>It's an important development because it adds to the growing willingness of the federal bench to take a closer look at the government's assertions that this law should pass low-level constitutional muster and because the judge's reasoning and language was persuasive:  that the <a href=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:>Defense of Marriage Act</a> actually changed the rules by "robbing states of the power to allow same-sex civil marriages that will be recognized under federal law."</p>

                <p>The administration cannot continue to advocate for this law, or at least it can't continue to ask that it only be tested against low level scrutiny, and still seriously maintain that it wants to expand gay rights, rather than contract them. I'm hoping that they are getting the point as more and more federal judges rule against them." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Olga Khvostunova</b> <a href= http://imrussia.org/>[Institute of Modern Russia</a>]: "On the last days of December 2010 the <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php>guilty verdict</a> in the second case of <a href=http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-mikhail-khodorkovsky/>Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a>, the former Russian oil tycoon, was announced at the Khamovnichesky Court in Moscow. For the second time the trial and the verdict raised questions not only of the state of country's independent judiciary, but also of Russia's "sovereign" democracy. The answer is quite obvious: they both failed.

                <p>Many experts agree that the first and the second trials are both symptomatic of what is going on in the Russian political system -- diminishing political freedoms, increasing corruption, controversial legal practices, suppression of opposition and critical media. Others, following public claims of the Russian Prime-Minister Vladimir Putin, believe that the Khodorovsky case is a fair trial of a former oligarch who didn't pay taxes and stole money and oil from his own company, Yukos. </p>

                <p>Still, to see that the <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php>trials</a> have been politically motivated, one need only to look to the facts. Mr. Khodorkovsky became a billionaire in the rough 1990s after the collapse of the USSR, snapping up state-owned oil fields and then creating one of the world's largest oil companies, Yukos. Like many Russian businessmen at the time, he gained a reputation for engaging in practices that could be viewed as ambiguous now, but at the time of initial capitalization and market formation in Russia they were merely dealings with the government. Later, Khodorkovsky reformed his business into a role model of corporate governance. </p>

                <p>Mr. Putin became president in 2000 and soon made it clear to the class of Russian oligarchs who earned their fortunes in the 1990s that they could keep their holdings if they did not try to undermine the Kremlin. Mr. Khodorkovsky was first and last to question the terms of the deal. He delved into politics which is where he ran into trouble. In 2003 he was arrested and has been in prison since. He and his business partner <a href=http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev>Platon Lebedev</a> were accused of tax fraud and embezzlement, and after an outrageous trial that brought attention to the case from the media all over the world, they were both convicted to 9 years in prison (later reduced to 8). Meanwhile, Yukos, once the major oil company in Russia, was dismantled, and assets worth over $30 billion were expropriated. Now they mostly belong to state-owned <a href=http://www.rosneft.com/about/>Rosneft</a>. Thus, there were at least two central motives behind the Kremlin's campaign against Khodorkovsky: eliminating Khodorkovsky as a political opponent, and eliminating Yukos as a way to re-nationalize the company's assets and increase the Kremlin's power. </p>

                <p>Overwhelming evidence that the case was politically motivated can be found throughout the whole trial process. For example: in 2003, the General Prosecutor found that there was no basis for the criminal case, still, it was reopened, notwithstanding the previous conclusion; violations of client confidentiality and the searches of Khodorkovsky lawyers and seizures of documents on illegitimate grounds; refusals to permit the summons of various government officials to furnish evidence; denial to adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defense in the cassational appeal, and many more.</p>

                <p>In 2005, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe issued a resolution regarding the case: it stated that the circumstances of the case "go beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice and include elements such as the weakening of an outspoken political opponent, intimidation of other wealthy individuals, and the regaining of control of strategic economic assets". In further notes the reference was made to the <a href=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=704193&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649>judgment<a/> (in French) of the European Court of Human Rights in the Gusinsky case of 19 May 2004, in which the Court found that the detention in remand of NTV television channel owner Vladimir Gusinsky violated Article 5 of ECHR because the applicant's prosecution had been used to intimidate him into selling off his stake in NTV to Gazprom.</p>

                <p>Moreover, at the conclusion of the first trial of Khodorkovsky, then-US Senators Obama and Biden and current-Senator McCain co-sponsored a <a href=http://www.robertamsterdam.com/S.%20Res.%20322%20Senate%20MBK.pdf>Senate resolution</a> [PDF] condemning, <em>inter alia</em>, the manipulation of the Russian criminal justice system in the campaign against Khodorkovsky and Yukos.</p>

                <p>In 2007, new charges of embezzlement were brought by the prosecution against Mihkail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. By the beginning of the trial three years later, 200 volumes of so-called "evidence" against the convicted tycoon were gathered to back-up the charges in the second case. Most of those -- like the stealing of all the oil extracted by Yukos in 1998-2003 (350 million tons) -- Khodorkovsky's lawyers qualified as "absurd". Russian prosecutors criminalized normal internal trade practices (transfer pricing), common for any vertically integrated oil company. Despite the second trial's manifest absurdities, the verdict was "guilty", thus increasing the imprisonment time for Khodorkovsky and Lebedev up to 14 years.</p>

                <p>The evidence behind the political motivations of Khodorkovsky's imprisonment was bolstered in 2009. In a <a href=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e3db7f1e-7548-11de-9ed5-00144feabdc0.html>Financial Times interview</a>, the former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov revealed details of closed-door conversations he had with then-President Vladimir Putin, who told him that Khodorkovsky had "crossed a line" by supporting certain political parties without his permission.</p>

                <p>If there are still doubts that the Khodorkovsky case is politically motivated, here's the final detail: two weeks before the verdict was announced, Vladimir Putin in his <a href=http://mayomo.com/94024-'thieves-should-be-in-jail'---putin-on-khodorkovsky> live conversation</a> [video excerpt, in Russian] with Russian citizens made it crystal clear that "the thief must stay in jail", quoting a line from a popular Russian TV-series. In the current Russian political environment it is the equivalent of a judicial verdict, and leaves no other interpretation as to who makes the decisions in the country."

In 2009, the Lisbon Treaties, the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), have inherited this competence and even enlarged it to a certain degree in Title V Chapter 3 of the TFEU on Judicial Cooperation in Civil Matters.</p>

<p>Based on former Article 65 TEC - now Article 81 TFEU - the EC began legislating in 2000.  Some regulations replaced and modified pre-existing Member State conventions, some replaced and modified Hague Conventions among Member States, and some were entirely new.

<p>The goal of unifying the law of international civil procedure is not yet finished. Future developments will bring some refinement of existing regulations and possibly cover more topics. However, within only a few years most major areas of the law of international civil procedure were unified.</p>

<p>Unification of private international law by means of regulations only started in 2009, covering only two, albeit important, areas.</p>

<p>     <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007R0864:en:NOT">Regulation (EC) No. 864/2007</a> of the European Parliament and the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II Regulation) entered into force.<br />

<p>Within only one year significant parts of the private international law relevant to international business transactions have been unified.  Many regulations covering other areas of private international law will follow.  Future developments include: <br />
	<br />
     A Proposal for a Rome III Regulation would amend <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML">Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003</a> regarding jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning the applicable law in matrimonial matters.<br />
	<br />
     A <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2006&nu_doc=400">Green Paper on matrimonial property regimes</a> exists in preparation of a Regulation on conflicts of laws in these matters, including the question of jurisdiction and mutual recognition.<br />
	<br />
     A Regulation on the private international law on succession and wills is prepared as well. In 2005 the Commission issued a <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&lg=en&type_doc=COMfinal&an_doc=2005&nu_doc=65">Green Paper on the private international law on succession and wills</a>. In October 2009 the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation on the private international law of succession and wills.</p>

<p>Two questions could be raised as to this fast-track unification: First, what is new or specific about this system, and second, who profits?</p>

<p><strong>What is new or specific?</strong></p>

<p>1. New and specific is the idea of comprehensive and systematic unification of the law concerning cross-border relationships at large. The activity of the last decade goes far beyond piecemeal unification. It is transforming the European Union into a homogeneous area of law.<br />
	<br />
2. Not new but specific is a strong tendency towards preferential treatment of the presumably weaker party. Such parties, notably consumers, employees, and insured persons, get easier access to the courts by jurisdiction in their country of habitual residence. Choice of law clauses are restricted and the applicable law in contractual relationships is the law of the country of their habitual residence.<br />
	<br />
3. Not new but again specific is the unlimited and unconditional freedom of choice of law in international business to business transactions. Governmental interests, through mandatory provisions and public policy restrictions, are only considered within the applicable law.<br />
	<br />
4. The tension between predictability and legal certainty on the one hand and fact-specific individual justice on the other is clearly decided in favor of the former approach. Only as a last resort, where there is a manifestly closer connection to a different country, will the applicable law deviate from pre-fixed rules.</p>

<p><strong>What are the advantages of new unified EU private international law? Who profits?</strong></p>

<p>First, the parties profit from this new set of rules on private international law. Uniformity will make their legal relationships easier and more efficient. And predictability will make their legal relationships safer.</p>

<p>Second, for the same reasons as the parties, the courts will profit too.  They may lose some power, but they will more easily and efficiently determine the applicable law without detailed investigations. </p>

<p>Third, both domestic and foreign lawyers may profit from having easier access to uniform private international law. This is true for litigation lawyers and lawyers advising clients. Although some of us, including I, might adhere to the wicked idea that law is best when it is complicated because otherwise nobody would need us, I strongly believe that private international law is not the area that should be complicated. Uniform and clear cut PIL rules will help us focus on the substantive part of the law that, in the end, is the only important part of our work.</p>

<p>Finally, lawmakers worldwide may profit, though not necessarily by copying what has been achieved within the EU.  Instead, they may consider these developments when evaluating modernization of their own PIL.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/hamoudiha">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that a recent decision by Iraq's Federal Supreme Court is the first opportunity to understand the Court's position on the interpretation of Article 2 of the Iraq Constitution, which prohibits law from violating the settled rulings of Islam...<br /><hrheight="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/hamoudi.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0"vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>Q</b></font>uite recently, in an opinion dated December 21 of last year (but published on its website sometime thereafter,) the Iraq Federal Supreme Court in a short, scantly heeded but quite significant decision, made its first important interpretation of Article 2 of the Iraq Constitution, which prohibits law from violating the "settled rulings" of Islam.  There has been much academic speculation respecting what the clause means, and I have been, and continue to be, very much of the opinion that the clause is more ornamental than real and meant to assert a Muslim identity more than act as a real constraint on past or existing legislation. This decision is the first opportunity to understand the position of the Iraq Federal Supreme Court on the matter.</p>

<p>The case itself, Decision 60 of 2010, involved an alleged construction contract between two parties.  One of the parties had sought to prove the existence of the contract by means of "personal evidence," meant generally to refer to oral testimony.  The lower court refused to hear the evidence and dismissed the case, pursuant to Article 77(2) of the Law of Evidence, which, in a manner that loosely resembles our own Statute of Frauds, requires the existence of a contract over a set amount to be in writing.  The allegation made by the appellant was that requiring a writing to satisfy evidentiary requirements was a violation of Article 2 because it conflicts with shari'a.</p>

<p>The first interesting thing that might be said about this decision, even before discussing the merits, is that it has been a long time coming.  The Court has been extremely reluctant to deal with Article 2 at all. This is hardly a surprise to many of us following Iraqi law and politics.  After all, Iraq has an extremely powerful clerical institution in Najaf and Article 92 of Iraq's Constitution permits jurists to serve on the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court, even though none have been appointed to that position.  It strikes me as self-evident that the judiciary would thus not try to provoke the powerful jurists by interpreting Islam for them, as this might lead the Islamists in the Council of Representatives, Iraq's legislature, to push for juristic inclusion on the Court. They could be successful in that effort.  After all, the jurists have shown their ability to influence events in Iraq, from the momentous, such as the date of elections, to the mundane, such as school curricula.  Given this, the Court has wisely felt it best to remain out of their sights.  If anything, it is more surprising that the Court heard a case on the matter of Article 2 at all, rather than that it took six full years post-constitutional ratification to do it.  </p>

<p>But the jurists are not all powerful, and Iraq's legislature is decidedly more secular this term than it was in the previous one.  While this hardly signals the end of Islamism as a political force, it does suggest a greater willingness on the part of the Court to rise to the challenge of offering competition, albeit very much at the margins, on the meaning of Islam in our challenging times. Certainly the Court's assertion of power is real, if cautious. In upholding the lower court decision, and by extension, Article 77 of the Law of Evidence, the Court's language was provocative and one must assume intentionally so.  This was not strictly necessary based on the shari'a rules concerning contracts in writing.  </p>

<p>While it is true that there is no requirement, or even recommendation, among modern Shi'i jurists that a contract be placed in writing, there is no prohibition in doing it.  Thus, for example, Grand Ayatollah Sistani indicates that a contract for sale need not take any specific form and need not be in Arabic.  Even conduct, specifically, delivery of the goods and payment for them, can constitute a contract so long as the intention to form it is present.  It is true that both he and his predecessor the late Grand Ayatollah Khu'i refer, when discussing contracts of sale, to particular parties "uttering" particular formulations to form a contract for sale in a manner that presumes that the most common form of contract is oral.  But this presumption does not translate into a prohibition under the rules as they are laid out.  In fact, Grand Ayatollah Khu'i describes two opinions respecting whether or not written contracts are permitted to those capable of speech and movement, it being uncontroversial for obvious reasons that one who is mute and incapable of moving their bodies may use a writing in place of speech. He then indicates that the "more manifest" is that writings are "tolerated" in place of speech.  Grand Ayatollah Sistani articulates much the same, but is more permissive, suggesting that the "more manifest" opinion is that writings are acceptable, not merely tolerated, irrespective of whether one is capable of speech more movement.</p>

<p>Admittedly there is some Sunni classical authority that discounted the evidentiary power of contracts in writing, as opposed to those concluded orally, in precise contradiction to Article 77(2).  On balance, however, it is fair to say that overwhelming Sunni and Shi'i Muslim praxis in the contemporary era is in favor of written contracts.  Aside from the pronouncements of the Shi'i Grand Ayatollahs, one need look no further than the booming multibillion dollar practice of Sunni-dominated Islamic finance, engaged in by such financial giants as HSBC and Citibank. It hardly needs to be said, these contracts are concluded invariably in writing and relied on as such.  </p>

<p>Thus, while perhaps the Court could have determined that the pronouncements of the Grand Ayatollahs and the Sunni classical authorities favor oral contracts, and that therefore to require contracts to be in writing violates the "settled rulings" of Islam, it had ample authority to decide otherwise without creating controversy.  It could simply have said that while it cannot be credibly maintained that Islam conclusively requires written contracts, a state law requiring them does not violate any sort of "settled ruling" as there is nothing "settled" on the question of contract formation given the varying positions of the authorities discussed above.</p>

<p>The Court instead took a different, and more potentially incendiary, approach.  In concluding Article 77 did not contradict a "settled ruling" of Islam, the Court argued that requiring a written contract harmonized with Islam, citing two verses of the Qur'an in order to reach this conclusion.  In other words, it challenged the jurists, stating on the basis of Qur'anic text, that written contracts were at the very least Islamically recommended, if not required.  The implicit conclusion is that the jurists got it wrong in failing to at least recommend written contracts, that the juristic derivations that presume mostly oral contracts, and that in the classical tradition discounted written contracts severely, were simply mistaken interpretations of the Holy Text.  </p>

<p>In most instances, this would be sure to provoke a reaction, given the central Shi'i assumption that it is the jurists of Najaf who are alone capable of deriving the rules of shari'a from sacred text.  It is as if the Supreme Court had chided the Pope on a matter of Catholic doctrine. As to how and why the Court felt confident enough to do something this radical, the particular subject matter of the dispute before the Court provides the basis.  The reality is that even though the jurists describe in detail the rules on shari'a as they concern matters of commerce, the relevance of those juristic rules in the modern world is exceedingly slight, with only minor discrete exceptions.  Even in Iran, where jurists control the state, the state freely adopts transplanted French civil rules for contracts, and not the rules of the very jurists who run the state.  The shari'a as concerns such matters is purely conceptual, theory without the slightest intent of practice, because the rules as they exist are simply incompatible with running a modern economy.  </p>

<p>Even a casual comparison of Sistani's rules and those of Iraqi law on the matter of the Court's decision is instructive as to why this is.  Article 77 of the Law of Evidence imposes a writing requirement for transactions generally. The rules of Sistani, Khu'i and the classical Sunni jurists described above relate to a contract for sale.  This is because the traditional Islamic rules have no general theory of contract, but instead divide contract into nominate forms, among them sale, lease, partnership, and the like.  If the Court actually wanted to take these rules seriously, it would then have to examine the validity of Article 77 as against each shari'a based nominate form of agreement and the rules of formation related to them, effectively obliterating the general theory of contract upon which modern commercial systems are founded.  To describe this as devastating from an economic perspective if carried out broadly is to understate the matter considerably.</p>

<p>Given the material realities, to ignore the bulk of Islamic rules as they pertain to commerce seems the only option, and the one taken by Islamic states and commercial actors alike, even devout ones.  This gives the Court some purchase to use somewhat provocative reasoning to reach the conclusions it does respecting written contracts without fear of causing a juristic reaction.  After all, if Iran's controlling juristic authorities do not care to adopt Islamic rules on contract, it is hard to believe that jurists in Iraq, given their restraint, will be very exercised about what the Court does to legitimate, on Islamic grounds or otherwise, thoroughly transplanted rules with roots now reaching back decades upon which its modern economy is based.  The fact that the Court was dealing with a specific instance where juristic derivations seem the most peculiar. This is a rare, but by not means unique, situation, where the Qur'anic verses do indeed by their plain meaning seem to contradict the juristic presumptions in favor of oral contracts--surely played a factor as well.</p>

<p>The juristic reaction would certainly not be the same were the Court to tread upon areas of religious doctrine that modern Muslims take more seriously, outside of commerce. If the Court, for example, were to reinterpret the Qur'an to adopt more expansive rights to women's divorce than those the jurists provide, the reaction would almost surely be swift and vociferous, and the Court would almost surely find its legitimacy challenged.  While it is growing in strength and independence, the Court has nowhere near the authority to challenge the jurists on such core matters of shari'a as family law.  Its influence for the moment probably lay at the very margins of modern shari'a, specifically, those areas where the historic rules are not taken very seriously at all and where their basis in Sacred Text is the most tendentious.  Still, the fact that the Court is willing to offer competition to the jurists on interpretation of Islam's sources is quite interesting, and worth following in more detail as the months and years progress.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Shafiq Jamoos</b> [Palestinian lawyer]: "The outbreak of the peaceful revolution of the Egyptian people was shocking - in every sense of the word - to many around the world. No one expected that Egypt, the "stable" country of the "wild" Middle East, would witness such an extensive revolution against the Egyptian government and even the "untouchable" President Hosny Mubarak himself.
                <p>What most of the world didn't know before the revolution was that Egypt's stability was quite illusory; it was based upon the oppression and fear of the people, and upon a tyrannical exclusion of political opponents. The suppression of Egypt's second voice could not in any way have derived from stable legal and political bases.</p>

                <p>Since the commencement of Mubarak's first term as president in 1981 and up to this moment, Egypt has been living under Emergency laws, which have diminished many constitutional rights and liberties, undermining every protection granted by the Egyptian Constitution to the people. The freedoms of speech, to work, to demonstrate, to nominate oneself to office, and to vote were all infringed on a daily basis via the regime's broad interpretation of the Emergency laws.</p>

                <p>In a country with 40% of its population living below the poverty line, a huge movement of privatization gave rise to a state-private alliance, which set up grand touristic, industrial and real estate projects. This regime was run in part by overindulgent businessmen, who reaped the benefits of privatization, but made the costs of living intolerable to ordinary citizens in light of their extremely low incomes. </p>

                <p>In 2007, rather than adopting laws and constitutional amendments that would alleviate the economic and political hardships of Egypt's citizenry, 34 amendments to the <a href=http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolcon.htm>Egyptian Constitution</a> were passed to crush every last hope of the Egyptian people to live in freedom and prosperity. Some of the most controversial amendments are:</p>
                <p>- Article 179: granting the police force more powers against the people with respect to search, seizure, interference, imprisonment and the restraint of movement. This made the Emergency laws a permanent feature of the Egyptian Constitution under "anti-terrorism" pretexts.</p>
                <p>- Article 76: requiring the consent of 250 votes of the two chambers of the parliament and the municipal councils in order to nominate oneself to the President's office. This minimized the opportunity of any politician other than President Mubarak to be a nominee in the first place, as all the foregoing institutions are controlled almost entirely by Mubarak's political party via unfair elections.</p>
                <p>-	Article 77: no amendment was suggested despite the people's persistent demand, as this article allows the president to remain in office for an unlimited number of 6 year terms.</p>
                <p>-	Article 88: terminating the judicial supervision of the elections, creating a huge deficiency of powers to the advantage of the Legislative and the Executive, undermining the last element of checks and balances in the Egyptian government. It's pertinent to mention that the Egyptian judiciary is quite respected by the Egyptians for its liberal and just attitudes. This attitude was the main reason behind the exclusion of the judiciary from the decision-making process.</p>

                <p>In light of these circumstances, Egypt during the last three decades has become a ready-to-use bomb that lacked a fuse; it was never a stable country nor was its political regime successful on any scale other than to promote narrow political and business interests. "Ex-Egypt" teaches us that equality and dignity are basic components of the human character that cannot be overlooked in any society; its experience shall also teach politicians a salutary lesson: that sometimes they have to listen to legal experts, and establish their regimes on the firmness of democratic institutions, peaceful circulation of power through honest elections, a government of laws not of men, the respect of human rights, and the upholding of the peoples' will.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute/about/who/shah">Naureen Shah</a>, from the <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute">Human Rights Institute</a> at Columbia Law School says that some Guantanamo detainees cannot go home and the US should design smarter monitoring protocols, let courts and the public test decide whether diplomatic assurances can prevent abuse, and resettle detainees who face too great a risk of torture....<br /><hrheight="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/shah.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0"vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he men still at Guantanamo may never see home again. But there are nearly two dozen who, like Farhi Saeed bin Mohammed, are so afraid of being tortured that they would rather stay at Guantanamo than be returned home. <br />
  <br />
It is difficult to fathom anyone preferring endless imprisonment to going home. But Farhi, who won a federal court order for his release after having spent more than eight years at Guantanamo, preferred just that. He worried that in Algeria, he would be tortured by the government or terrorist groups. But the U.S., having received "diplomatic assurances" from Algeria that he would be treated humanely, sent him to Algerian custody against his will. <br />
  <br />
Farhi's case is not the first of its kind. The U.S. has repeatedly sent detainees to possible torture based on "diplomatic assurances," promises from foreign governments with records of condoning, encouraging, and sometimes covering up torture, that this time, they will not torture. <br />
  <br />
Though the State Department checks up on returned Guantanamo detainees, torture is typically clandestine and hard to detect or deter. If an unreleased Wikileaks cable is any indication, the U.S. is not doing nearly enough to prevent delivery from the purgatory of interminable detention at Guantanamo to the hell of torture in the shadows. <br />
  <br />
The cable describes a U.S. embassy visit to former Guantanamo detainee Rukhniddin Sharopov whom the U.S. sent along with detainee Mokit Vohidov to Tajikistan in 2007. The State Department has reported "harsh and life-threatening" conditions in Tajik prisons, where beatings are "common." Security officials use "systematic beatings, sexual abuse and electric shocks to extort confessions." Unsurprisingly, and whatever the assurances, within months of their return, Sharopov and Vohidov cried out in open court that Tajik interrogators had tortured them. <br />
  <br />
Still, the cable shows the U.S. embassy behaving with baffling ignorance or indifference to the risk of further abuse. In late 2009, the Tajik authorities denied the U.S. embassy access to Sharopov for more than three months. During this time, they transferred him from general prison to pre-trial detention, allegedly for attempting to escape. That left Sharopov vulnerable to abusive interrogation again with no chance for U.S. officials to detect abuse or intervene. <br />
  <br />
When U.S. embassy staff finally met with Sharopov in December 2009, they may have put him in further danger. Flouting the basic rules of torture monitoring, they interviewed Sharopov in the presence of his captors. If he even hinted at abuse, Sharopov risked retaliation. Yet, he might have made hints. The leaked cable says he "casually" referred to his time at Guantanamo as a "sanatorium" [sic]. Compared to torture at a Tajik prison, no doubt. <br />
  <br />
U.S. staff asked Sharopov to confirm he was treated "the same" as all the other Tajik prisoners- a perverse cross-examination given U.S. knowledge of widespread mistreatment. Yet they did not conduct a medical or psychological exam to catch signs of torture that he may have feared revealing or that Tajik authorities might have purposefully concealed. <br />
  <br />
We cannot know what became of Sharopov. Tajik authorities have blocked even the International Committee of the Red Cross from their prisons. But this kind of monitoring is bound to fail. In Bush-era rendition cases, there is proof it did. In December 2001, according to media and Council of Europe investigations, masked U.S. commandoes helped Sweden deliver asylum-seekers Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad Alzery to Egypt, based on diplomatic assurances. Five weeks later, the Swedes visited to check for abuse. They did not see bruises or bleeding. The men, also interviewed in the presence of their captors, evaded the Swedes' questions and simply pleaded with them to visit again. Both had been beaten and electrocuted. <br />
  <br />
The U.S. has gotten duped before, too. Other Wikileaks cables reveal "credible reports" that a Guantanamo detainee sent to Tunisia in 2007 was abused, with the Tunisian government blocking the U.S. from checking on him later. That prompted the U.S., rightly, to refuse more transfers, provoking the now fallen Tunisian government's ire. <br />
  <br />
But the Justice Department has not foreclosed the option of sending another detainee, Umar Abdulayev, into Tajik custody. Across the board, the U.S. is shirking judicial review of torture questions, wrapping itself in rhetoric of national security and executive prerogative, all too reminiscent of the Bush administration. The Justice Department even waited to tell the Supreme Court about Farhi, the latest forced returnee, until after he was put on a plane, even though he had a pending petition with the Court. <br />
  <br />
With secrecy and obfuscation, the U.S. once again stands alone among its peers. The UK and other allies, dealing with terrorism suspects in deportation cases, give them a day in court by providing the terms of assurances and blueprints for better monitoring, including regular, private interviews of returnees, conducted by professionals trained to detect abuse. </p>

<p>The U.S. government should do the same: design smarter monitoring protocols, let courts and the public test claims that diplomatic assurances can prevent abuse, and resettle detainees who face too great a risk of torture. To truly end the legacy of Guantanamo, the U.S. should ensure the safety of the men too afraid to go home again. <br />

		<title>UNITED STATES: Birthright Citizenship and the Fourteenth Amendment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Medeiros, Hamline University School of Law '14, is an accomplished writer living in Minnesota. He writes about the Fourteenth Amendment's birthright guarantee...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> remember the day as if it were yesterday.  After several weeks of studying the US Constitution in eighth grade Civics class, on the last day before our winter break, my closest friend, Juan Castillo, and I were emptying our lockers.  "I have something I want to tell you," he said, almost secretly, "but I cannot tell you now. I'll call you later tonight."  I could sense a sadness in his eyes as they refused to meet mine, and there was a slight crack in his voice.</p>

<p>That night Juan called, and his voice just above a whisper. "What's going on?" I asked. "What's the big news?"</p>

<p>"I have to tell you something that I don't want anyone else at school to know.  I'm telling you this because you're my best friend - I'm not returning to school after break." He paused and added, "My family is moving back to the Dominican Republic right after Christmas."</p>

<p>Juan was born in the United States, but his parents were not.  He and his family returned to the Dominican Republic when he was a baby, and they moved back to the States when he was ten years old. "Why are you moving back?" I asked. "I mean, don't you like it here?  Can't you even wait until summer?"</p>

<p>"My father is getting transferred back there," he replied. Then he lowered his voice again and added, "Don't worry about me; I'll be alright."</p>

<p>That was the last I would ever hear from Juan.</p>

<p>When I returned to school after break, our Civics class continued to study the US Constitution. Ironically, we picked up with the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.</blockquote>

<p>As I looked at the empty chair where Juan used to sit, everything started to make sense. Having been born here, Juan was a citizen of the United States, but his parents were not.  It was not long before I realized that saying his father was "transferred" was Juan's way of telling me that his family was being deported.</p>

<p>That was my first exposure to immigration policy's personal impact, and it helps explain why I have spent my professional life studying and working in the field of immigration law.  Now, thirty years after I heard them for the very time first time, the words of the Fourteenth Amendment have become part of the public discourse as some members of Congress are attempting to limit the rights of immigrants by advocating the denial of birthright citizenship to those born to undocumented parents in the United States.</p>

<p>Under the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, all persons born or naturalized in the United States who are also subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are citizens. Much of the current debate turns on the meaning and intention of this clause. The argument put forth is that undocumented immigrants are not under the jurisdiction of the United States, and so the children of undocumented immigrants also do not fall within that jurisdiction. Therefore, such children, although born in the United States, should not be American citizens.</p>

<p>The argument is flawed when scrutinized in context. Upon passage, the Fourteenth Amendment effectively reversed the decision in the case of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZS.html"><span class="casename">Dred Scott</span></a>, a slave who sued in federal court for his freedom. The Supreme Court had held that neither slaves nor free descendants of slaves were citizens, and so the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted to specifically enable African-Americans born in the United States to obtain citizenship at birth.</p>

<p>Additionally, the author of the Citizenship Clause confirmed in his original debates that the clause subject to the jurisdiction of the United States was specifically designed to exclude only foreigners who belonged to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers, and Native Americans who maintained their tribal ties. This was confirmed in a number of cases, including <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0169_0649_ZS.html"><span class="casename">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</span></a> (1898), which involved a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were statutorily ineligible for naturalization because of their race.  The Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco, was, in fact, entitled to birthright citizenship, and stated in dictum that the term subject to the jurisdiction of the United States excluded two classes of people, other than Native Americans: children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomats of a foreign state. The phrase was never intended to exclude anyone else. (Incidentally, Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol4/html_files/v4p1165.html">Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a>, which granted full U.S. citizenship to Native Americans.)</p>

<p>Opponents of birthright citizenship also argue that because undocumented parents still owe their allegiance to a foreign country, their children who are born in the United States do not owe complete allegiance to the United States and, consequently, should be denied citizenship.  But it is important to remember that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment make no reference whatsoever to allegiance. This is because allegiance is loyalty to the place of one's birth, and not to the citizenship of one's parents.</p>

<p>So while there are some who believe the Fourteenth Amendment should exclude those born in the United States to undocumented parents, history suggests otherwise. However, the history behind the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment doesn't seem to be making its way into the public dialogue, and instead there is a movement underway to reshape the Constitution from a document historically interpreted to grant rights to those living in the United States, to one that limits and even denies those rights. The call is to redefine the Fourteenth Amendment to exclude citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are undocumented, or in temporary lawful status.</p>

<p>A popular explanation for this movement is that illegal immigrants specifically come to the United States to give birth, to gain citizenship for their children and thus obtain legal status themselves. Misinformed proponents of this theory callously refer to such children as "anchor babies" for illegal immigrants. However, the reality is that most undocumented people come to the United States for economic reasons, and "anchor babies" are simply not part of the immigration trend.  Under current law, US citizens must wait until they are at least 21 years of age to petition for adjustment of legal status for their parents.  Simply because a child is born in the United States does not mean that the parents are allowed to stay permanently. To the contrary, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly INS) is not reputed to be an agency designed to keep families together.  It was not so with my friend Juan, and it is not so today.</p>

<p>Equally misinformed is the argument that deporting "anchor babies" would decrease overall illegal immigration.  In <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/BirthrightInsight-2010.pdf">The Demographic Impacts of Repealing Birthright Citizenship</a>, September 2010, the Migration Policy Institute estimates that passage of the House-introduced 2009 Birthright Citizenship Act - which would deny US citizenship to children born to unauthorized immigrants - would actually increase the unauthorized population from its current 10.8 million to 16 million by 2050.  Worse still would be effects of implementing a stricter option being explored, under which citizenship would be denied to US-born children with one unauthorized immigrant parent, even if the other parent were a US citizen. In such a scenario it is estimated the unauthorized population would rise to 24 million by 2050. Amending the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution to prevent birthright citizenship would only escalate the very problem it is intended to resolve.</p>

<p>All three branches of our federal government have confirmed birthright citizenship, and to eliminate this right would be unconstitutional and impractical.  The law has not changed since <span class="casename">United States v. Wong Kim Ark</span>, and neither has the Fourteenth Amendment.  What have changed, however, are the escalating and complex problems of illegal immigration, and public opinion toward undocumented immigrants.  While it is true that our country has an immigration problem, that problem is not with undocumented immigrants, but rather with a broken system in need of significant reform.  While we may disagree over our country's immigration policies, we must agree that the way we respond to those policies cannot include tampering with the Fourteenth Amendment.  Doing so would show a blatant disregard for the provisions of the Constitution - provisions designed to expand civil rights, not limit them - and would violate over a hundred years of legal progress by undermining the civil victories of our past.</p>

<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ne of the legal consequences of failing to protect victims of human rights abuses is the state's obligation to provide full reparations for the wrongful act committed (<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,INTINSTRUMENT,,,3ddb8f804,0.html">Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts</a>, Articles 28 and 31). The responsible state has no justifications for failing to do so (Draft Articles, Article 32).  Although most serious violations, by their nature, are irreparable, reparation is an act by which the truth is acknowledged along with victims and their dignity. As a rule, the right to reparations must reflect the gravity of the violation; it must be "proportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered" (<a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/remedy.htm">UN Principles on Reparation</a>, Principle 15).</p>

<p>In October 2009, Uruguay enacted <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=18596&Anchor=">law 18.596</a> (also known as Uruguayan Reparations Law), which recognizes the right of victims to receive reparations for the human rights violations committed by the State between June 1968 and February 1985. With the Uruguayan Reparations Law, composed of 24 articles, the State recognizes for the first time its failure to protect fundamental human rights, in addition to its participation in systematic practices of human rights violations, such as torture and forced disappearances. Although this is a positive step towards complying with international standards, the Uruguayan Reparations Law remains restrictive. More disturbingly, and paradoxically, it acts as an amnesty law in disguise.</p>

<p>To properly identify the failures of law 18.596, the fundamental principles of reparations will be considered against the articles manifested in this law. The UN Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (hereinafter UN Principles on Reparation) has laid out five fundamental principles of reparation: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition.  </p>

<p><strong>RESTITUTION</strong></p>

<p>The first principle stated in the UN Principles of Reparations is restitution (<em>restitutio in integrum</em>). This principle is the primary form of reparations since it looks to "restore the victim to the original situation before the gross violations."  However, in practice, the possibility of restoring the victim to his or her original situation is close to impossible. Restitution includes: restoration of liberty; enjoyment of human rights, identity, family life and citizenship; return to one's place of residence; restoration of employment; and return of property.  </p>

<p>The Uruguayan Reparations Law makes reference to various laws covering some aspects of restitution. Some of the laws it refers to are: Law on the reinstatement of dismissed government employees (Law 15.783); Law on persons who were obligated to abandon the country (Law 17.449); Laws on the recuperation on pension and retirement benefits (Law 17.949 and Law 18.033); and Law on the declaration of absence of the forcibly disappeared (Law 17.894).    </p>

<p>Although these measures try to achieve some measure of status quo ante, they might not be sufficient. As an example, the Reparations Law fails to decriminalize the acts for which victims were arrested, and it does not require for the State to return victims' property expropriated during the dictatorship.     </p>

<p><strong>COMPENSATION</strong></p>

<p>Compensation, as defined in the UN Principles on Reparations, is a form of reparation that provides economic compensation for human rights violations. Important aspects to be considered in determining appropriate compensation include: physical or mental harm; loss of opportunities, including employment, education and social benefits; material damages and loss of earnings, including loss of earning potential; moral damage; costs required for legal or expert assistance, medicine and medical services, and psychological and social services.    </p>

<p>Those who will be compensated under the Uruguayan Reparations Law include the families of the disappeared or killed, the families of the children who disappeared for more than 30 days, irrespective of whether their identities have been revealed, and those who suffered grave harm. The law does not offer any monetary compensation to families or dependents whose family members were imprisoned, in many cases for years.    </p>

<p>The Uruguayan Reparations Law establishes compensation for a very limited group of victims, and the amount of compensation is the same regardless of individual circumstances. In other words, all families will be paid the same amount, without considering the different circumstances and different damages (e.g., loss of earnings).   Furthermore, the reparations law does not attempt to provide compensation for the loss of opportunities, for the loss of earnings and earning capacity, moral damage and costs of legal actions taken by victims' families.        </p>

<p><strong>REHABILITATION</strong></p>

<p>Victims of human rights abuses are also entitled to receive other forms of compensation, such as rehabilitation. Rehabilitation includes measures to promote physical, psychological and legal and social services "for as full rehabilitation as possible [sic]" (Article 14 <a href="http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=IV-9&chapter=4&lang=en">CAT</a>).   </p>

<p>The measures of rehabilitation in the Uruguay Reparations Law are few and limited in scope. The Reparations Law provides medical services free of charge as well as psychological rehabilitation, but only to those victims who suffered a violation of their physical and psychological integrity and who were imprisoned for more than 6 months.  This limited group excludes all families of victims.  </p>

<p><strong>SATISFACTION</strong></p>

<p>Satisfaction is also a form of reparation and helps restore dignity to the victims and their families. Satisfaction should include a judgment against the perpetrators of the crime, but this should be accompanied by a public acknowledgement of the truth and the recognition of the state's responsibility for wrongdoing. In addition, satisfaction can include public commemoration, which has the symbolic value of memory and justice. Public commemoration can take the form of naming streets after victims or creating public places dedicated to the victims.    </p>

<p>Satisfaction measures in the Uruguayan law have helped to restore dignity to the victims to a limited extent. The state, among other things, has recognized its responsibility for the wrongful acts committed during the dictatorship and has created public spaces to commemorate the victims. Nevertheless, the law does not mention if the government will acknowledge this responsibility publicly or if it will only remain in the form of a law. Furthermore, the state fails to grant other possible measures of satisfaction (compared to the reparation law from Peru Law N. 28.595), such as reconciliation acts in coordination with the victims, creation of a remembrance day for the victims, creation of a victims registry and individual letters sent to the victims and their families recognizing state responsibility.    </p>

<p>Measures of satisfaction in the Uruguayan Reparations Law, unfortunately, are limited in extent.  </p>

<p><strong>GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION</strong></p>

<p>Whereas an admission of wrongdoing helps restore victims' dignity, guarantees of non-repetition ensure that those human rights violation will never again occur. Guarantees of non-repetition include, inter alia, judicial, institutional and legal reforms; human rights training; effective control over military and security forces; protection of legal, medical, media and related personnel and human rights defenders; and observance of international human rights.  In the Uruguayan Reparations Law, the principle of guarantees of non-repetition is not mentioned.  </p>

<p><strong>URUGUAYAN REPARATIONS LAW - ARTICLE 22</strong></p>

<p>Victims of human rights violations have a right to truth, justice and to reparation. States have the obligation to ensure effective enjoyment of these rights guaranteed in international law. Under no circumstances should victims give up any of these rights for an exchange of the other, such as the right to seek justice.  </p>

<p>The Uruguayan Reparations Law surprisingly includes Article 22, which prevents a victim who has agreed to receive any form of reparation from seeking legal remedy.  Article 22 of law 18.596 reads: "Any [person] who takes advantage of the benefits/reparations allowed under this present law is prohibited from taking future action against the state of Uruguay, in any jurisdiction, whether national, foreign, or international."</p>

<p>Even without other limitations imposed by Uruguay's law 18.596, Article 22 alone delegitimizes the reparations law since it predicates the right to reparations on a waiver of the right to justice. Article 22 can thus be interpreted as an offer of reparations only to those willing to stay quiet. In fact, reparations and the responsibility to accord victims justice are never optional measures, but rather legal consequences of wrongdoings by the state.      </p>

<p>Unfortunately the Uruguayan law was approved and entered into force on October 2009.  After decades of waiting for justice to be done, some victims might find the decision of whether to exchange possible legal remedies for reparations difficult - some victims might view it as a "better than nothing" deal.  </p>

<p>Nevertheless, I do hope that victims will reject this Uruguayan Reparations Law in a symbolic affirmation of their legal rights and dignity and patiently wait (a little longer) for the decision by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in <em><a href="http://www.cidh.org/demandas/12.607%20Gelman%20Uruguay%2021ene10%20ENG.pdf">Gelman</a></em> [PDF]. <em>Gelman</em> is the first case before the Court against Uruguay, where the state's failure to provide justice and reparations for human rights violations during the dictatorship will be questioned and subjected to international standards. Victims of the Uruguayan dictatorship and international observers of human rights anxiously await and hope for a decision that, inter alia, will shed light on these fundamental principles of reparations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lindsay Green-Barber</strong> [PhD Candidate, <a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/dept/POLIT/pages/program/program.htm">CUNY</a>]: "Ecuador's President Correa will today sign an executive decree ordering a <em>consulta popular</em> (referendum) to be held within 67 days.  While the justices of Ecuador's <em>Corte Constitucional</em> have, with a majority of opinions, deemed President Correa's <a href="http://www.hoy.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/las-10-preguntas-del-referendo-y-consulta-453579.html">proposed <em>consulta</em></a> [Spanish] as constitutional, it remains anything but popular.  The debate over the <em>consulta</em> has revealed chasms within the ruling party, <em>Alianza PAIS</em> (Country Alliance; AP), and opened new spaces for critical discussion regarding President Correa's <em>Revolucion Ciudadana</em> (Citizens' Revolution) and the concentration of power in the executive branch of government.<br />
                <br />
                Critics of the consulta argue either that all or some of the five questions regarding <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-constitutional-court-approves-anti-crime-constitutional-reforms.php">changes to the constitution</a> and especially to the judicial system are, in fact, unconstitutional, or that the remaining five questions will hurt the Ecuadorian economy by destroying jobs in the gambling and bullfighting industries.  Some of this opposition has come from within President Correa's AP, the first real sign of discontent amongst this ruling block.  At least four <em>asambleistas</em> (assembly members) have renounced their AP affiliation, along with the constituent block, the <em>Ruptura de 25</em> (Rupture of 25).  Thus the <em>consulta</em>, by creating divisions within the AP, has potentially diminished President Correa's ability to push controversial legislation through the <em>asamblea</em> (assembly).<br />
                <br />
                Largely absent from this debate has been discussion regarding the proposed question about President Correa's controversial proposed <em>ley de comunicacion</em> (communication law).  Correa first proposed this law in 2009 and it has been debated through two sessions of Ecuador's <em>Asamblea Nacional</em> (National Assembly).  In its current form this law creates a government council -- with some representatives elected directly by the president -- to review all media productions to safeguard against offensive material and to check for truthfulness.  The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Organization of American States (OAS) have made formal statements in opposition to this law, arguing it violates human rights and freedom of speech.  The OAS even committed to sending a representative to Ecuador to observe the debate over the law this January.  However, Correa's political maneuvering has successfully removed this crucial debate from the <em>asamblea</em> and overshadowed it with questions regarding the <em>Corte Constitucional</em>.<br />
                <br />
                The <em>consulta</em> questions have the potential to concentrate power in the executive branch of government by giving the president a larger role in the selection of justices and in the judicial branch and in the controlling of media and media productions.  However, in a political context in which democratic values and freedoms -- especially those of freedom of speech and freedom of the press -- have been limited, the vigorous debate surrounding the <em>consulta</em> and the internal divisions becoming apparent within <em>Alianza PAIS</em> provide hope that Ecuadorian democracy has a foundation strong enough to withstand the antidemocratic tendencies of the current administration."</p>

		<title>The Middle East protest movements: each with a story, all with uncertainty</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a href=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=11787855&Itemid=326/>Dr. Jonathan Schanzer</a> [Vice President of Research, <a href=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php>Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a>]:

                "Across the Middle East, protest movements are taking hold. While each draws inspiration from the examples of <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php>Egypt</a> and <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php>Tunisia</a>, each country has a story of its own.</p>

                <p>In Iran, for example, the world may be witnessing a repeat of the demonstrations that rocked the Islamic Republic in the aftermath of the rigged elections of June 12, 2009. The prospect of another four years under <a href=http://www.president.ir/en/>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> drew hundreds of thousands of angry Iranians to protest in the streets. To the chagrin of the protestors  -- and democracy advocates worldwide -- President Obama did little to support the nascent Green Movement, emboldening the Iranian regime to mount a brutal crackdown on them.</p>

                <p>The return of the Green Movement has been anticipated for months. After nearly two years of dormancy, the people of Iran are drawing courage from the Egyptians and again coming out to challenge the regime. Will Iran's dissidents find support in the West this time? And can they withstand <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/iran-opposition-leaders-jailed-reports.php>brutal countermeasures</a> from the regime?</p>

                <p>Across the Persian Gulf, the tiny archipelago of Bahrain is seething. As it has for decades, the majority Shi'ite population -- which constitutes some 70 percent of the country's 700,000 residents -- is demanding its rights. The protests that began with calls for greater representation have evolved into brash calls to topple the Sunni monarch, <a href=http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38>King Hamad bin Khalifa</a>. This change in tone unquestionably came in mid-February, after Bahraini forces fired on the peaceful protestors in the capital city of Manama.</p>

                <p>For now, Hamad's insurance is Washington. The U.S. has significant interests in Bahrain: namely, a base that is home to the Navy's Fifth Fleet. Washington is understandably concerned that King Hamad's successor might not be as hospitable. If a Shi'ite government gains power in Bahrain, U.S. officials fear it could become an Iranian proxy.</p>

                <p>Another strategic ally under fire is Yemeni President <a href=http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php?lng=en>Ali Abdullah Saleh</a>. Saleh has been at the helm for 32 years, and is now fighting for his political life. Saleh is not unfamiliar with unrest in the country's south, where a secessionist movement has sought since 1994 to break from the north. But now, after weeks of protest, Saleh's tribal allies in the North have begun to defect, further weakening his base. Violence has erupted across the country, casting doubt on Saleh's ability to hold on.</p>

                <p>But, as with King Hamad in Bahrain, the U.S. cannot easily allow Saleh to go. Washington enjoys a quiet and important counterterrorism partnership with Yemen, which has helped the United States combat al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, the most active of the terror network's affiliates.</p>

                <p>There is also the question as to who would replace Saleh. The long-time leader has kept Yemen stable by placating its influential tribal patriarchs and paying them patronage. Thus, world leaders view him as an indispensible guarantor of stability, albeit an imperfect one.</p>

                <p>Then there is Libya's <a href=http://www.algathafi.org/html-english/index.htm>Muammar Gaddafi</a>. Rightly dubbed the "Mad Clown of Tripoli" by former President Ronald Reagan, Gaddafi has been in power for 42 years, and he has now dragged his country into <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php>civil war</a>.</p>

                <p>The people of Libya first began their revolt in Benghazi, the country's second largest city, near the Egyptian border in the northeastern corner of the country. This was particularly significant because the East has long chafed under Gaddafi's rule. Apart from regional and tribal distinctions, Benghazi is also the country's political weathervane. From student protests to Islamist insurrections, Benghazi has always been at the center of trouble for Gaddafi's regime. When protests spread to the countryside and to Tripoli, the regime has fired upon civilians from land and air.</p>

                <p>While most world leaders would likely welcome the fall of Gaddafi, the prospect still confronts them with a dilemma: who would maintain stability after he is gone? After four decades of one-man rule, the country has no other political institutions, and could quickly descend into a failed state if the regime collapses.</p>

                <p>With growing pockets of the country in the hands of anti-regime forces, Libya has now spiraled into a full-scale civil war. Change is on the horizon, but of what kind?</p>

                <p>In contrast to Gaddafi, among the more friendly dictators under duress is <a href=http://www.kingabdullah.jo/homepage.php>King Abdullah II</a> of Jordan. Protests led by the Islamic Action Front, the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, are agitating for change. For now, demonstrations have been largely peaceful, save one in which eight people were injured by a pro-monarchy mob wielding weapons. But a month's worth of sporadic unrest has hamstrung the young monarch. He will likely be forced to make changes to the constitution, and allow for greater representation. On the surface, this is a good thing. However, true democracy could bring challenges to the unpopular peace with Israel, trade agreements with the West, and even the country's nominally secular culture.</p>

                <p>Of course, Jordan's system of government is tipped in the King's favor; he can veto any parliamentary initiative. But how long can that power last, and how long will the country's military support a monarch who defies the will of the people?</p>

                <p>As new protest movements erupt from Morocco and Mauritania (and maybe Saudi Arabia), it is important to remember that the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions are not yet over. No one yet knows what they will yield.</p>

                <p>The complexions of these protests movements are all disparate, but their outcomes are similarly unpredictable. Some may yield democracy. Others may bring new dictators to power. Still others may produce Islamist polities. And these distinctions are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, it is not uncommon to see hybrids that share two of these traits (Islamist dictatorships and Islamist democracies).</p>

                <p>In the Middle East, states can also go through years of flux, before reaching stability.  Accordingly, the predictions of liberal democracy sweeping the region may be premature."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=http://www.farzanahassan.com/>Farzana Hassan</a> [Author, Women's rights activist]: "Much of the Arab world is in turmoil. The Shia majority in the tiny island kingdom of <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/bahrain.htm>Bahrain</a> has suffered years of oppression by the ruling Sunni minority and is now demanding freedom. The citizens of newly liberated <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/egypt.htm>Egypt</a> and <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/tunisia.htm>Tunisia</a> suffered economic hardship and repression before revolting against the Mubarak and Ben Ali regimes. Protests are also taking place in <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/morocco.htm>Morocco</a>, <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/yemen.htm>Yemen</a> and <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/algeria.htm>Algeria</a>, though they have not yet reached fever pitch.

                <p><a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php>Libya is still burning.</a> Muammar Ghadaffi has proved to be even more fiendish than Mubarak in crushing the revolt against his forty year dictatorial rule.</p>

                <p>The world is rightly concerned about the outcome of these widespread protests and revolutions across North Africa and the Gulf. The question is whether this Arab awakening is a struggle for democracy in the Western liberal sense, or a spread of radical Islam across the region. It is obvious that Arabs want freedom from dictators, but do they have a clear vision about the kind of society they wish to forge?</p>

                <p>In this regard, a recent <a href=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1874/egypt-protests-democracy-islam-influence-politics-islamic-extremism>PEW survey</a> is rather disconcerting. While young Egyptians demanded democratic reform, they also appeared to endorse <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/sharia.php>Shariah</a> regulations such as killing for apostasy and stoning for adultery.  Their understanding of democracy appears to be influenced by Islam's view of participative government as expressed in the principles of Shura (Consultation) and Ijma (consensus of the community). But do these principles as embodied in nascent Islam's political system represent democracy in the true sense, especially when greatly circumscribed by aforementioned legalities such as stoning for adultery and capital punishment for apostasy?</p>

                <p>Tunisia is still experiencing aftershocks from last month's revolution. One would hope for less Islamist influence in that country than in Egypt and Libya, but Tunisia's "moderate Islamist" party led by <a href=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/2011233464273624.html>Rachid Ghannouchi</a> is poised to play a key role in the shaping of a future democratic Tunisian government.  Yet among the recently revolutionized countries, Tunisia perhaps has the greatest chance of reconciling Islam's "theo-democracy" with modern liberal values.</p>

                <p>In the rest of the Arab world, the prospects of such reform are less pronounced. There's much speculation on the role of Islamists in shaping the politics of these countries. The role of Islamist parties has been exaggerated at times and downplayed at others. But what also needs to be considered in this discourse is the extent of religious fervour observed among ordinary protesters on the streets. Images of hijabi and niqabi women protesting against Mubarak's regime are all too familiar. Would these individuals and their male counterparts be less inclined to resist a bill introducing punishment for apostasy should the Muslim brotherhood decide to propose one?  Would Coptic Christians have the right to seek top political office in Egypt? Will the religious fervour of the youth enable increased Islamization of laws due to their disinclination to resist it?</p>

                <p>Islamization need not monopolize political parties or organizations.  Moreover, democracy is much more than just electing governments. It also includes an acknowledgement of individual liberties, freedom of conscience and an independent judiciary. A state based on Islamic values would most likely be governed under some interpretation of Shariah law. Often, this would bar women and minorities from ever assuming leadership roles in the government. Shariah law would also not be subject to review, as it would be considered divine. Within the framework of such a system, therefore, could a minority representing a non-Shariah viewpoint ever have the opportunity to become the majority? And if not, can such a scenario be deemed democratic? Arabs must address these important questions before formulating a vision for their countries now caught in the firestorm of revolution and discontent."</p>

		<title>&quot;Genuine revolution&quot; in the Middle East has reached several points of no return</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <a href=http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/iais/staff/pappe/>Professor Ilan Pappe</a> [Department of History, <a href=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/>University of Exeter</a>]:

                "The Middle East is producing good and hopeful news for the first time in many years. For quite a while, the only potential progress in the region has been a series of attempts to resolve the long-standing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; but these junctures have failed to produce anything positive on the ground.</p>

                <p>This past month has seen many more genuine moments of change and hope. A main reason for renewed optimism is that ordinary people are attempting to create better and more just lives for themselves. These people do not articulate the noble ideas of 'justice' and 'freedom' in the typically cynical way as do politicians across the world; rather, they explain to us on a daily basis the meaning of these concepts. They die for 'freedom' and 'justice' in peaceful demonstrations dispersed by brutal force in Libya, Algeria, Bahrain, Iran and Palestine. They show up in millions at the Liberation Square of Cairo to demonstrate their craving for a fundamentally decent life, ensuring that we understand their commitment just like the man who ignited the new <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-inspired-protestors-face-violent-crackdowns-by-arab-governments-hrw.php>wave of genuine revolutions</a> - a street vendor from Tunis who burned himself to death as as a victim of the <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/01/un-rights-chief-urges-investigation-into-protestor-deaths-in-Tunisia.php>oppressive regime</a> now gone in his country.</p>

                <p>While it is still too early to summarise what in essence is only the beginning of a process, we can already observe a defining moment in the region's history. And we are still likely to witness ups and downs before the full picture emerges. But there are several noteworthy points of 'no return' that affect not only life in the Middle East, but also the future relationship between the Middle East and the West. Let us consider four of them:</p>

                <p>Firstly, the revolutions have exposed just how little of the Arab world the West and its top academics and media experts really know. None of them predicted such changes. Even when the revolutions began, they maintained that the Egyptian regime would survive. This is more than just a failure to predict; it represents a total misunderstanding of the <a href=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/28/protests.democracy.islam/>Arab youth</a>, who constitute the majority of Arab populations. Young Arabs have finally defeated Orientalist depictions of them as indifferent, obedient and primitive. Much like their Western counterparts, the Arab youth now form an important actor in politics, society and culture. </p>

                <p>Next, there is an unprecedented impact on Israel's own and external image in the Middle East and beyond. The sight of democracy in action in the Arab world has driven home the message that Israel is not the "only democracy in the Middle East." In fact, the recent revolutionary month casts doubt on her being a democracy at all. The democratic forces, especially in Egypt, but also in Jordan and in the 'pro-Western' regimes in the area, regard a bolder stance against Israel's oppression in the Palestinian areas. Surely Israel will have to change its policy of demonizing the Arab world.</p>

                <p>The third point of no return is of particular relevance to the Americans and the British. The events so far have further proven wrong the idea of the Iraq occupation as a means of democratic reform. As we now know: instead of democracy, the occupation of Iraq destroyed that rich country and pushed it into perpetual anarchy. It has become apparent to us that Saddam Hussein would have been overthrown in any event. This lesson is bound to reformulate the West's relationship with the Middle East. </p>

                <p>Finally, the events so far have highlighted the multiple layers of what we in the West call 'Islam.' The revolutions have been carried out by young Muslim men and women (together with members of the various Christian minorities), who represented the many faces of a 21st century Muslim person. One hopes that the media will abandon its tendency to regard 'Islam' or 'Muslim' in a one-dimensional and reductive way, and instead reflect upon the pluralistic nature of these people and their world. Such a conception would include the free, educated, loving and democracy-seeking youth we have seen on our TV screens in the last month.</p>

                <p>In the past, the only plausible revolutionary scenario for the Middle East was that the current regimes would be replaced by an Iran-like regime. But in the wake of current events, even the regime in Iran is <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/iran-opposition-leaders-jailed-reports.php>in danger</a> of being toppled. It seems that the alternative to the present regimes would be a new political system: not one borrowed from the West, but one which would cater to the needs and aspirations of civil society in the most equitable and just way."</p>

		<title>US must develop grand strategy in light of Middle East regime changes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=http://patriciadegennaro.com/>Patricia DeGennaro</a> [International Security Specialist, Senior Fellow, <a href=http://www.worldpolicy.org/> World Policy Institute</a>]:
                "One Arab government after the other is falling - Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. Following their lead are Algeria, Yemen, Bahrain and perhaps even Iraq. The kings from Jordan and Saudi Arabia are handing out money to quell any rebellion. All of this is happening and the US are still struggling to define a new Middle East policy. Recently, the US passed up an easy chance to improve their credibility in the region by <a href=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/18/us-vetoes-israel-settlement_n_825391.html>vetoing a UN resolution</a> to declare Israeli settlements illegal. Further the Obama Administration has been taking the easy way out with nothing but tough rhetoric and clear indication of another massive intervention through war.</p>

                <p>As Libya's leader continues to bomb his people, the use of force or at least a strong military containment contingent may be the best option at the moment. But that does not preclude the reality that the US need a robust grand strategy for the region. Allowing dictators and repressive governments to rule while doing nothing more than safeguarding Israeli and foreign oil interests is no longer a feasible strategy. </p>

                <p>The Arab masses have spoken. The people want democracy and control of their own destinies. Further, they are willing to risk their lives for a new standard of rule "for and by the people." This is something that American policymakers have clearly forgotten how to support. The world has become global and multi-polar, but US policymakers have still not clued in. They forget that one act creates a domino effect that causes a ripple for the marginalized across the world. </p>

                <p>It is time for the US to style its policy after the military's approach to the future operating environment: via a multi-level, multi-pronged, intricate and ever moving framework. Secretary of State Clinton, to her credit, rightly talks about the "whole of governance." Though the efforts to get to this state of US foreign policy readiness is nowhere in sight. The military brings in its own civilians while the Department of State and USAID place a full scale initiative toward integrative partnership on the back burner.  All of this precludes the formulation of a comprehensive and effective policy in the Middle East.</p>

                <p>The Secretary of State is stepping up, but far too slowly. There is an initiative to create country task forces, bring in humanitarian aid, and work with international partners. However, again, there is no clear idea as to the direction in which these efforts are going. Otherwise, Israel would be included and further pushed toward a democratic state that is inclusive of all religious groups. The region needs democratic support of a kind that allows the people to define their idea of a workable democracy. The US must hold true, as the President's Cairo speech insinuated, to its promise to honor the peoples' desire to chart their own destinies.</p>

                <p>The US must be dedicated to developing a policy that works for all affected parties. Past policy, and not terrorism or Islamic extremism, has gotten the US and its international partners into this conundrum. The Arab people have demonstrated that the current political system is not working by an insurgency against ruling parties, governments, and practices. It is time to align with their interests."</p>

		<title>Does Refusal to Accept the Filing of Charles Taylor&amp;apos;s Defense Closing Brief Serve the Interests of Justice?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Moira A. Imong, a research assistant at the <a href="http://www.arcadia.edu/abroad/default.aspx?id=22608">Arcadia Center for East African Studies</a> in Tanzania says that when the Trial Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone refused to accept the late filing of the Charles Taylor's closing brief, it violated the right of the defendant to be heard....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/fu.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n February 11, 2011, the Trial Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone deferred closing arguments in the trial of Charles Taylor. </p>

<p>This Court was established in 2002 through an agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone, following up on Security Council Resolution 1315 of 2000. The Court has jurisdiction to try those charged with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the laws of Sierra Leone. These violation were allegedly committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.</p>

<p>Charles Taylor, then President of Liberia, was indicted on March 7, 2003. On December 4, 2003, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for Charles Taylor. But it was only on March 29, 2006 that Charles Taylor was nabbed by the Nigerian authorities and flown to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, where he was arrested by the United Nations Mission for Liberia and handed to the  Court. He is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and has denied them all. </p>

<p>On October 22, 2010, the Trial Chamber ordered the parties to file their closing briefs by January 14, 2011. But, on January 10, 2011, the Defense requested a stay of proceedings pending the resolution of various outstanding motions before the Court. Those pending motions involved recalling witnesses, admission of evidence, and disclosure. These outstanding motions are obviously important because once resolved, they will contribute to the Defense's ability to present a conclusive and well-reasoned final brief. In other words, not knowing the judicial statement on those pending requests constitutes an impediment to a final analysis of one's case. </p>

<p>If the motion to stay proceedings were granted, it would have amended the October 22, 2010 Order, and a new deadline would have been set for the filing of the closing briefs. However, the Defense's request for stay of proceedings was dismissed on January 12, 2011 by a majority, Justice Sebutinde being absent. As a consequence, on January 14, 2011, the Defense filed a motion for a stay of proceedings pending resolution of outstanding issues. On January 27, 2011, the Prosecution filed a response to the application submitting that it should be dismissed for failure to establish, "exceptional circumstances." </p>

<p>The Prosecution further submitted that allowing the application condoned dilatory tactics and, "creates an inequity contrary to the interest of justice and expeditious conduct of proceedings." On February 2, 2011, the Trial Chamber dismissed the motion on the grounds that the Defense had not satisfied the conjunctive conditions of exceptional circumstances and irreparable prejudice required by the Court's Rule of Procedure and Evidence 73(B).</p>

<p>Additionally, on January 20, 2011, the Trial Chamber held a status conference to allow the Defense to explain why they had failed to file their final trial brief and why they refused to accept the Prosecution's final trial brief. </p>

<p>First, the Defense explained they failed to file a closing brief because at the time of the order, they were unaware of facts that were crucial to the case and were the subject of the pending motions, such as the leaked cables from the US Embassy in Liberia. </p>

<p>Second, the Defense explained that it rejected the Prosecution's final brief because they did not want to be accused of having tailored its final brief to the substance of the prosecution's submissions. At the end of the status conference, the Judges issued a majority ruling holding that the submissions were not sufficient to cause the Trial Chamber to review or amend the original order rendered on October 22, 2010. Justice Sebutinde dissented, reasoning that it was unfair to ask the Defendant to wrap up his Defense when there were outstanding issues that could have an impact on the Defense's case. Surprisingly, she then suggested that the Defense should file a piecemeal final brief. </p>

<p>On February 3, 2011, the Defense filed its Final Trial Brief, but the Trial Chamber refused to accept the late filling. As a result, On 8 February 2011 the Defense filed a motion seeking leave to appeal the decision of the Trial Chamber. The next day, counsel for the Defense and the accused left the Trial Chamber in reaction to the Chamber's refusal of their late filing. On  February 11, 2011, the Trial Chamber granted leave to the Defense to file an appeal against the decision rejecting the Defense Final Trial Brief, with Justice Richard Lussick dissenting. The trial was therefore adjourned until the Appeals Chamber decides on the Defense motion.</p>

<p>The final or closing trial brief is fundamental in a criminal trial. The brief summarizes the entire proceedings and at the same time it highlights the strengths of the party's case. But the final trial brief does not only benefit the parties, it also aids the Court when writing the Judgment because the trial briefs explain the arguments of the parties and their assessment of the evidence. In the particular instance of the Defense, the final trial brief responds to the Prosecution arguments introduced during the trial or in the Prosecution closing brief. Furthermore, the final brief is an important tool for the accused to exercise their right be heard. An accused person has an inalienable right to a fair hearing and the right to be heard is an essential component of the fairness of the proceedings. As a result, the final trial brief is critical and must be in the case file. </p>

<p>In the present case, expediency, rather than fairness, stands out. The Trial Chamber stipulated an early deadline for filling of final briefs which the Defense failed to meet. This failure has been interpreted as a "blatant breach of a Court Order." But one still wonders whether such a breach justifies the rejection of the Defendant's final brief. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Sebutinde points out that the interest of justice and the respect for the fair trial rights of the accused compelled her to respectfully dissent from the view held by the majority. In addition, she states that the Rules of Procedure of the Court stipulate that a party shall file a final trial brief not later than five days prior to the date set for the presentation of that party's closing argument. It was her opinion that the late filing of the Defendant's final trial brief was still within the ambit of the rules of procedure of the Court because the breach of the Court order is only a technical issue. Even though procedural rules are important, they not outweigh the service of justice and the requirement of a fair trial. Justice cannot fail simply because of the violation of a procedural order. Moreover, refusing the Defense final trial brief, besides being unfair to the accused, also prolongs the trial proceedings because now the trial has been postponed. In consideration of the gravity of the charges against the accused, the Trial Chamber should have been more concerned with the cause of the Defense's delay, rather than with the delay itself. </p>

<p>Precedents show that this very Trial Chamber accepted a late filing in another proceeding where it was in the interest of justice. In that case, the filing had been only a day late, as compared to 20 days in the present case. Or could it be that the Defense--unlike in the present case--had filed part of its motions in time? </p>

<p>The decision of the Trial Chamber is at odds with its own precedents and it would have been in the interest of justice to accept the Defendant's final brief. In conclusion one hopes that the Appeals Chamber will exercise some leniency and accept the Defendant's late filing in order to guarantee a fair hearing for the accused. Accepting the late filing will also maintain uniformity and consistency of the law where the precedent is concerned.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a>, professor of law at An-Najah National University in Nablus, Palestine, says the UN Security Council acted in an unusual manner against the government of Libya....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/curtisdoebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n 26 February 2011 the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1970 (2011) that takes harsh action against the government of Libya </p>

<p>In a way that is unusual, if not unique, in the practice of the Security Council, the resolution refers the matter of Libya to the prosecutor of International Criminal Court for investigation and demands that the prosecutor report to the Council within two months on how the investigation is proceeding. This is the first time a matter has been referred to the Prosecutor by a unanimous decision of the Council. When the situation in Durfur, Sudan was referred to the ICC, four States abstained.</p>

<p>Notably the resolution stops short of any type of use of force, including the establishment of a no-fly zone. There is also no mention of a right of intervention or the responsibility to protect that was urged by several States, but very much opposed by others. The dedicated discussion on the responsibility to protect that took place in the General Assembly in July 2009 showed that the overwhelming majority of States viewed any right of intervention as incompatible with the prohibition of interference with the internal affairs of a State. To stress this position the resolution's preamble reiterates the Council's "strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya...."</p>

<p>Despite adopting the resolution under Chapter VII, few States even attempted to substantiate their allegation that the situation in Libya formed a threat to international peace and security. For this reason, the aggressive measures that are found in the resolution are extraordinary.</p>

<p>The measures include not only the ICC referral, but also a travel ban on, and seizure of assets of any person designated in the resolution's relevant annex or so designated by the Committee. As these measures are not limited in time it will require another Council vote to change or remove them. The five permanent members of the Council will have the right to veto such efforts. The resolution also allows any Member State to submit the name of an individual to be designated for the travel ban or assets seizure.</p>

<p>The criteria for making such a designation is also vague. Paragraph 22(a) states that any individual may be designated if they have been "[i]nvolved in or complicit in ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses against persons in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, including by being involved in or complicit in planning, commanding, ordering or conducting attacks, in violation of international law, including aerial bombardments, on civilian populations and facilities." </p>

<p>While the paragraph is not limited to individuals working for the government, it would appear to allow the designation of a wide range of government actors. These actors could include military personnel and police who are acting to restore national security or public order. Both military officers as well as soldiers carrying out these orders could be designated. As such this broad language could be read to constitute a unique interference with one of the most significant domestic priorities of a government: the maintenance of security and public order.  </p>

<p>In the preamble to the resolution the Council recognizes that "the Arab League, the African Union, and the Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference" has condemned "the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that are being committed in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya." The resolution says little about the stress that each of these bodies has put on ensuring that these matters are resolved internally and do not lead to outside interference.</p>

<p>Just hours before the Security Council adopted resolution 1970, the UN General Assembly's Human Rights Council also adopted a resolution by consensus calling, most notably, for the General Assembly to suspend Libya from membership in the UN's main human rights body. On 28 February the General Assembly responded to this call by suspending Libya's membership in the Human Rights Council.</p>

<p>Although these efforts are evidence of the ability of UN bodies to act quickly when the political circumstances allow, they also highlight the hypocritical discrepancies that continue to exist between actions concerns powerful States and actions concerning the rest. </p>

<p>While action was taken in against Libya when an estimated several hundred people were killed, no action was taken against Egypt when hundreds of demonstrators were killed. More strikingly where was the UN when the United States invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and killed more than a million people in these two countries?</p>

<p>The rule of international law requires a more consistent application of this law. Otherwise, political power may be enough to get action in some instances, but some of the more egregious violations of international law, which are also some of most serious threats to international peace and security, will go unanswered. Such a state of affairs may do more to waken then rule of law then to promote it.</p>

Ali Khan</a>, Professor of Law at Washburn University says the Congressional hearings proposed by Representative King violate the dignity of individual Muslim Americans, encourage over-generalizations that promote public panic and fear, and reveal inflated concerns for homeland security...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/khan-ali.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>D</b></font>espite calls to stop the proposed Congressional hearings on the inflammatory topic of, "the radicalization of American Muslims," Representative Peter King--a Roman Catholic, the Republican Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, and a strong advocate for the Irish Republican Army--is determined to investigate the so-called homegrown Islamic terrorism. Numerous faith groups, including the Catholics, oppose King's Hearings as a crude attack on the religious dignity of Islam. Jewish leaders and rabbis, such as Rabbi David Saperstein, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, have been most vocal in condemning the undignified implication that, "there is an inherent link between Islam per se and terrorism [which] is not helpful to religious tolerance in America." <a href="http://www.interfaithalliance.org/news/422-interfaith-alliance-and-colleagues-raise-concerns-about-rep-peter-kings-planned-hearings-on-radicalization-of-the-american-muslim-community">A league of other faith groups</a> warn that, "singling out a group of Americans for government scrutiny based on their faith is divisive and wrong." However, King remains unpersuaded, reaffirming regrettable popular opinions that Islam poses a threat to national security, that mosques are turning into centers of radicalism, and that American Muslims are actively planning to engage in acts of terrorism. </p>

<p><strong>Dignity of the Individual </strong><br />
In addition to challenging the religious dignity of Islam, a religion now well-established in the U.S., Representative King's hearings violate the principle of human dignity, the bedrock of the law of human rights. Human dignity requires that group identity should not be the sole criterion for judging individuals. Every individual, regardless of his or her racial, religious, or other group identity, is entitled to human dignity. This principle of dignity of the individual, though it applies to all, is particularly protective of individuals of vulnerable minorities, such as American Muslims. King knows that several million Muslims living in all parts of the U.S. epitomize diversity and individuality. They all are not the same. American Muslims are South Asians, Arabs, African Americans, and Caucasians. They are immigrants and they are native-born; they are men, women, and children. They are cab drivers, students, doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Ignoring complex compositions of American Muslims as individuals, Representative King's hearings endorse an inaccurate impression that American Muslims constitute a violent monolithic community, or, worse, that each and every American Muslim poses a threat to homeland security. </p>

<p><strong>Harmful Overgeneralization</strong><br />
As public figures wielding influence, lawmakers are bound to avoid harmful over-generalizations that cause public panic or fear. Opponents of these hearings point out that Representative King is following Senator Joseph McCarthy, who in the 1950s tilled the popular American fear that Soviet-sponsored communist spies had infested the nation and were planning to overthrow the U.S. Constitution. Senator McCarthy was correct to the extent that communist spies had indeed infiltrated the U. S. What was incorrect with McCarthy's Red Scare was an irresponsible over-generalization under which every egalitarian person, every critic of free markets, and every opponent of the U.S. foreign policy was regarded as a communist spy.  Patriotic Americans who disagreed with Senator McCarthy's conservative agenda were seen as state enemies. McCarthyism is now associated with a phenomenon that morphs legitimate concern into an unlawful over-generalization.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, King's Hearings are charting the McCarthyist path. King underscores a legitimate homeland security concern. A few individuals would likely commit acts of terrorism and some already have. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized Muslim citizen, attempted to detonate a car bomb in Times Squares. In 2009, Major Nidal Hasan, a Muslim born in Virginia, killed 13 persons at Fort Hood.  However, select acts of terrorism, no matter how despicable, cannot be inflated into the collective guilt of an entire community. History teaches us, again and again, that over-generalizations lead to error and tragedy. Most Muslim Americans are like most other Americans, engrossed in their daily lives. They commute to work, they take their children to school, they work, they come home, and they look forward to a restful evening. Committing violence against their own country does not cross their mind. Committing the cardinal error of over-generalization, Representative King, despite legitimate concerns he has for homeland security, comes across as a prejudiced lawmaker determined to demonize American Muslims as violent radicals. At a time when the U.S. needs the goodwill of domestic Muslim communities to safeguard homeland security, King is widening the gulf of trust and mutual respect among Americans.</p>

<p><strong>Inflated Concerns for Homeland Security</strong><br />
Homeland security is a legitimate congressional concern. Members of Congress are bound by oath or affirmation to defend the U.S. Constitution against domestic and foreign enemies. However, it is the U.S. Constitution that members of Congress must defend. No responsible lawmaker would reduce the Constitution's complex rights-based architecture to mere homeland security. It is no secret that inflated concerns for homeland security can assault civil liberties and protected rights. For instance, Middle Eastern autocrats, as we witness the revolt against them, have for decades denied the people's freedoms in the name of homeland security. Rights-based democracies interweave homeland security into the precious fabric of rights and liberties. The internment of Japanese Americans during the Second World War was a grave error precisely because the internment policy threw away rights and liberties for the sake of homeland security. Congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the House, must not allow Representative King to conduct these hearings that challenge the religious dignity of Islam and promote harmful generalizations decline to treat American Muslims as individuals. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Javier Centonzio, Stetson Law '12, is an Iraq War veteran. He writes about the veterans issues addressed by Veteran Treatment Courts...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>hroughout our nation's history we have resorted to armed conflict to resolve differences among ourselves and other nations. We have been ready and willing to send our young men and women to far-off lands without much forethought or planning of how we would care for them once they returned home. The current conflicts in which our country is involved have produced over 2 million veterans, many of whom experience difficulties readjusting to life back home in America. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is tasked with providing federal benefits and health care to our nation's veterans. Their motto, "To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan," comes from President Lincoln's second inaugural address. These words were chosen to signify the commitment the federal government has to providing services and care for our veterans.</p>

<p>On January 11th, 2010 Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki addressed a suicide prevention conference held in Washington, D.C. During his <a href="http://www1.va.gov/opa/speeches/2010/10_0111hold.asp">address</a>, Secretary Shinseki confirmed the existence of an epidemic that many feared existed in our country. "Of more than 30 thousand suicides in this country each year, fully 20 percent of them are Veteran suicides. That means, on average, eighteen Veterans commit suicide each day." As a combat veteran of Iraq, the news that 18 veterans take their lives each day was not surprising to me. I know of many fellow veterans who chose to commit suicide. What was surprising was the apathy of the American people once the rate of suicide was made public. This apathy made me realize I had to serve as a voice for veterans and raise awareness. </p>

<p>The illusions I once had of returning to a grateful nation where veterans could enjoy the freedoms we fought to protect were replaced with the truth that we must continue to fight once we return. It is vital that we fight and advocate for those who have served, are serving or will serve in the future. Veterans represent every demographic in our society; whether rich or poor, black or white, gay or straight, they have all made a commitment to serve others and have selflessly done so. They give so much and ask for nothing in return but to be allowed to enjoy the freedoms and liberty they fought to protect.<br />
 <br />
Secretary Shinseki urged those attending the suicide prevention conference to identify their role in preventing suicide amongst veterans and to take ownership of the problem. What is the role of the legal profession in preventing suicide among veterans? The legal issues that veterans face are as diverse and numerous as they themselves are diverse and numerous. A precious few in our profession have set the example of what our role is in this fight. I had the honor of meeting one of these precious few, the Honorable Judge Robert Russell. Judge Russell is an Associate Judge for the Buffalo City Court and created Buffalo's Drug Treatment Court and Mental Health Treatment Court.</p>

<p>While presiding over these courts, Judge Russell noticed a growing number of returning veterans appearing on his dockets and other treatment court dockets in surrounding areas. This troubling trend sparked Judge Russell to take ownership of the problem and identify his role in helping veterans. On January 15th, 2008, Judge Russell established the nation's first-ever Veteran Treatment Court in Buffalo, New York. In creating the first Veteran Treatment Court, Judge Russell took a pro-active approach to dealing with problems faced by veterans by developing a specialized treatment court to meet their particularized needs. </p>

<p>The effects of war significantly contribute to mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, arrests and suicide among veterans. The Veteran Treatment Court provides judicially supervised treatment plans that are developed by a team of professionals working with the individual veteran. The team consists of mental health professionals, health care professionals, peer mentors and court staff. Once the veteran completes his or her program of treatment, he or she will have the charges dismissed or be given an alternative, non-incarcerative sentence. Soon after creating the Veteran Treatment Court, Judge Russell and his staff received numerous requests from other treatment professionals throughout the country for guidance on handling the growing number of veterans on their dockets. </p>

<p>Currently there are over <a href="http://www.nadcp.org/JusticeForVets">50 Veteran Treatment Courts</a> operating in 21 states. While the number of Veteran Treatment Courts is growing, it has not yet reached an adequate level to deal with the number of veterans needing the treatment these courts provide. With the growing trend of criminalizing homelessness in our country, the large population of homeless veterans would benefit greatly from the treatment provided through these courts. Judge Russell discovered one role that our profession can play in preventing veteran suicides and showing appreciation for their service. </p>

<p>On November 3rd, 2009 Secretary Shinseki unveiled the VA's <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/ODVA/TASKFORCE/reintegration/FiveYearPlan-PPT.pdf?ga=t">five-year plan</a> to end homelessness among veterans. Part of this five-year plan requires that yearly summits be held throughout the nation's VA facilities. On Thursday, February 3rd, I attended the Homeless Summit at the Bay Pines VA Medical Center to find out more about this five-year plan and how I could help as a law student. One of the first things that struck me about the event was the repeated requests for input and ideas from those in attendance. The room was filled with local health care professionals, mental health professionals, social workers, counselors, law enforcement officers and concerned citizens. The most intriguing part of the event came when they announced that Veteran Treatment Courts are now part of the plan.</p>

<p>The VA's recognition of the need to implement Veteran Treatment Courts is an important step in ensuring our veterans receive the treatment they need and the services they have earned. There are still many steps that need to be taken in order to create Veteran Treatment Courts in every state so that every veteran has access to justice. I urge those of you who are interested in helping our heroes to take action and contact your local representatives and members of the bar to tell them of the importance of helping our veterans obtain access to justice. We have lost too many of our bravest and brightest to suicide and a criminal justice system that was not designed to serve their particularized needs. When they took an oath to defend our great nation they did so without hesitation or concern for themselves, but this is no excuse for us to hesitate now when they need us the most. It is up to each and every one of us to show them that we are concerned about them and that we value the sacrifices they have made on our behalf.</p>

<p>Witnessing first hand the difficulties faced by those in countries devoid of the rule of law had a tremendous impact on me. While some among us may point to countries lacking the legal system we possess with a sense of pride and hubris, it is clear that our system is far from perfect. Our failure to address the legal issues and meet the needs of our heroes is clear evidence of our imperfection. Veterans deserve the very best of our profession and our legal system; a system that itself would cease to exist without their service and sacrifice.</p>

Whether it is Justice Scalia's closed-door constitution "teach-in" for the congressional Tea Party Caucus, or the news that Virginia Lamp Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas has now become a registered lobbyist for her Tea-Party inspired organization, questions are increasingly raised about whether the actions of some members of the high court are contributing to the perception that our federal courts have become increasingly partisan.  Indeed the Thomas' activities have caused the greatest alarm.  Last year Mrs. Thomas' created Liberty Central - a Tea-Party affiliated group for whom she raised large sums of money.  And just recently it was <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/48812.html">revealed</a> that Justice Thomas had failed for 13 years to comply with the obligation to provide information regarding his wife's income.  Thomas is also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/us/politics/15thomas.html?hp">under intense scrutiny by Common Cause</a>, for his attendance at a conservative confab in Palm Springs sponsored by the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer">Koch brothers</a>, powerful wealthy conservatives who have funded--among other conservative causes--opposition to health care reform.   Thomas' spokesperson first indicated that Thomas gave a talk and "dropped by" the event, but Thomas' disclosure forms from 2009 indicated a four-day stay at the meeting, and reimbursement by the conservative legal group the Federalist Society.  The Thomas' seemingly can't be shamed, and Congress simply doesn't have the stomach for another confrontation with the combative and resilient duo, so it's unlikely that much will come of Common Cause's concern.</p>

<p>But the pressure is starting to build.  Recently, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022304975.html?hpid=moreheadlines">over 100 law professors signed a letter</a> asking that ethical standards covering federal judges be extended to cover Supreme Court justices as well.  Congress got into the fray when over <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49166.html">70 Democrats signed a letter</a> demanding that Justice Thomas recuse himself from cases involving challenges to the health care law because of the appearance of bias.  Before this concerted action by concerned law professors, most commentators and legal scholars had <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/01/25/133195963/scalia-speaks-to-tea-party-caucus-democrats">soft-peddled concerns</a> with the justices' forays into the political realm.  Just last month Professor Noah Feldman in the Sunday New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/opinion/13feldman.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=noah%20feldman&st=cse">suggested</a> that concern with the appearance of impropriety in the justices' political activities is a tempest in a teapot. Supreme Court justices, he argues, have always been political.  Feldman points out that the first Chief Justice, John Marshall, served as Secretary of State, while he was a member on the Court.  But Feldman's comparison of 21st century Supreme Court ethical standards to the practices of justices nearly 200 years ago, or even in 1937 is unpersuasive.  Arguing that the Courts have always been political is like excusing South Carolina congressman Joe Wilson, who shouted "you lie" at President Obama during a speech before Congress on the grounds that more than a century ago South Carolina congressmen were known to resort to <a href="http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Caning_of_Senator_Charles_Sumner.htm">caning their opponents on the Senate Floor</a>. Just because it used to be worse doesn't mean it's not bad. </p>

<p>Justice Scalia's decision to engage in a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/21/scotus.scalia.tea.party/index.html">closed-door constitutional seminar</a> with the congressional Tea Party Caucus, cannot be likened to what Feldman deemed the political activity of several justices serving during World War II. And attending a weekend conference with conservative political benefactors, activists and lawyers can hardly be compared to serving as a prosecutor at the Nuremburg war tribunal trials (as Justice Robert Jackson did), or chairing the commission that investigated the attack on Pearl Harbor (as Justice Owen Roberts did). The latter two constitute public service engaged in on behalf of the entire country--not just in furtherance of the aims of one political party.</p>

<p>It's also not clear that our courts have always been as political as they are today.  It's worth remembering that despite deep divisions among the Court's members, some of the Court's most controversial cases in the past were decided by unanimous opinion (think, Brown v. Board of Education, Cooper v. Aaron, U.S. v. Nixon, Clinton v. Jones).  In those cases, the Court--although internally split--put the interests of the public and its own legitimacy ahead of the individual outcome desires of the justices.  The turning point perhaps was Bush v. Gore - a universally derided political 5-4 decision, in which the justices in the 5 member majority could not even sublimate their ego enough to sign on to one opinion justifying the decision to stop the vote recount.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/conduct/Vol02A-Ch02.pdf">Code of Judicial Conduct</a>, which applies to all federal judges, was enacted in 1973.  It's gone through several amendments.  Its purpose is to promote both the fact and appearance of impartiality for our federal courts.  Likewise, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/455.html">federal statute</a> which sets out when judges should recuse themselves from hearing cases was amended in 1974 to require that judges withdraw from a case in which their "impartiality might reasonably be questioned."  Both the Code of Judicial Conduct and the federal recusal statute reflect the demands of due process, which guarantees every litigant the right to appear before an impartial tribunal.  Requiring judges to withdraw from cases in which their impartiality might be questioned by a reasonable person, is designed to "<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=486&invol=847">promote confidence in the integrity of the judicial process</a>."</p>

<p>This focus on the appearance of bias, rather than on actual bias, developed during the second half of the 20th century.  In short, a seismic shift in our conception of impartiality and judicial ethics has taken place beginning in the early 1970s.  As a result, even justices who came from strong ideological law practices (like Thurgood Marshall) or who were forceful partisans in the government (like Justice Rehnquist) were held to the expectation that they would be circumspect in their political activity once they ascended to the bench.  At his confirmation hearings, Clarence Thomas insisted that he would "strip down like a runner" as a Supreme Court justice, and abandon the partisan advocacy he had undertaken as a member of the Reagan administration.  Thomas offered this reassurance (dubious though it may have been), because he understood that even in 1991 we still expected our Supreme Court justices to adhere to the standard requiring the "appearance" of impartiality, whatever their ideological view.  Now we're asked to shrug our shoulders and accept that "justices will be political" as fait accompli.</p>

<p>What has become increasingly clear is that too few legal ethicists are willing to acknowledge that the Supreme Court's leadership on this issue is necessary.  The Court should promote greater transparency and stand united in adherence to the letter and spirit of the federal recusal statute which compels judges to be attentive to activities in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned.  A major overhaul of Supreme Court recusal practice is in order.  The current practice is cloaked in secrecy and relies too heavily on an individual justice's discretion.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Roberts, as head of the Court could undertake a process of creating standards for the justices' political activity.  It might mean that justices would be discouraged from showing up at both Federalist Society and American Civil Liberty Union conferences, but this seems a small price to pay for reasserting the importance of the appearance of impartiality on the Court.  As <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Viewer.aspx?doc=/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/conduct/Vol02A-Ch02.pdf">Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct advise</a>s, "judges should accept freely and willingly restrictions that would be burdensome to the ordinary citizen."  It was gratifying to see the Chief Justice at the State of the Union address this year (although the 3 most conservative justices were absent).  If the justices must attend "political pep rallies," it's best when they do so in public and when their presence can demonstrate the unity of all three branches of our government, whatever our ideological differences.  </p>

		<title>Regardless of labels accountability must be sought in Libyan atrocities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about-us/staff/gabor-rona/><strong>Gabor Rona</strong></a> [International Legal Director, <a href=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org>Human Rights First</a>]: "Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi is committing atrocities against his people. His armed forces, police and mercenaries have been reported to be systematically targeting civilians in a misguided attempt to quell public demonstrations for democratic reform. A week ago, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said this to reporters in Los Angeles: "I have seen very disturbing and shocking scenes, where Libyan authorities have been firing at demonstrators from warplanes and helicopters. This is unacceptable. This must stop immediately. This is a serious violation of international humanitarian law."<br />
                <br />
                It is gratifying to see the Secretary General's unequivocal condemnation. But there's a problem. International humanitarian law is the law of armed conflict, otherwise known as the laws of war, detailed in the Geneva Conventions. At the time of Ban's statement, there was no war in Libya and so, international humanitarian law did not apply. Because the laws of war permit killing, the Secretary General unwittingly lowered the bar for use of official force even as he rightly condemned it. Whatever crimes were or are being committed by the Libyan regime outside the context of armed conflict, they are not war crimes. Human rights law would be the more appropriate benchmark; specifically "crimes against humanity," defined as a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population. The <a href= /paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php>"crimes against humanity"</a> label has been properly suggested by High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay and other UN human rights experts. <br />
                <br />
                Others have cried genocide, perhaps on the false assumption that what begins as murder - even mass murder - becomes genocide when some magic number of deaths is recorded. In fact, genocide is the destruction of, or attempt to destroy, an identifiable national, ethnic, racial or religious group. While one murder, or even no murders, might still be genocide (for example, forced sterilization of members of the group) genocide is not, at least for now, what's happening in Libya.<br />
                <br />
                In the week since Ban's statement, the situation on the ground has changed. Increasingly organized rebel forces, some of them dissident members of Libya's military, are engaging the government's forces. It's beginning to look more and more like civil war. Once the threshold into armed conflict is crossed, international humanitarian law applies and some important distinctions must be made. Targeting even one peaceful demonstrator in armed conflict is a war crime, while the widespread or systematic targeting of them remains a crime against humanity. On the other hand, humanitarian law recognizes the right of government forces to use armed force against rebels who directly participate in hostilities. In further recognition of the legal equality of parties to the conflict, humanitarian law also contains no prohibition against the rebels' use of armed force, although that would remain a crime under domestic law.<br />
                <br />
                By whatever name, atrocities appear to be taking place in Libya. They must be stopped and those responsible must be held accountable. The Security Council's referral of the Libyan situation to the International Criminal Court and the prosecutor's commencement of an investigation are essential steps on the road to accountability. But as long as we're giving those acts a name, let's use the correct ones."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/hamoudiha">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that even though Decision 88 may be troubling, Iraqi Constitutional Law is far from settled and that competing authorities must now recalibrate their efforts ... <br /><hrheight="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/hamoudi.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0"vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>N</b></font>ot long ago, Iraq's Federal Supreme Court issued a decision, published in early 2011, that has caused some level of uproar within Iraq's political classes.  The decision, Number 88 of 2010, effectively subjects independent agencies to some level of greater control by Iraq's executive, leading members of Parliament to describe this as the first step in a rising dictatorship.   Given the hyperbole, quite excessive in my view, that has been attached to some of the sentiments, it is worth exploring the decision, lengthy by Iraqi standards, what it means, and how the problems it addresses might be solved.</p>

<p>To be sure, though I am often a defender of Iraq's highest court, this opinion is troubling.  Nevertheless, the problem of constitutional interpretation with which the Court was faced was also quite real.  The provisions of Iraq's constitution as they concern independent agencies are anything but clear, and in fact leave a great deal to be filled in by post ratification constitutional practice.  The Constitution creates no less than thirteen independent agencies, with Article 108 specifically authorizing the addition of others "according to need and necessity."  But the greater difficulty lies not so much in the number of agencies, but in the nature of their relationship to the three branches of government.  Some are "connected" to the legislature and others to the executive.  Another, the Central Bank, is "responsible" before the legislature.  </p>

<p>Still others are to be monitored by the legislature, while a fourth set are connected to the legislature and coordinate with executive bodies and judges.  This is only a partial list. Leaving aside two independent commissions where the relationship is completely undefined,   I have been able to identify no less than seven different forms of interrelationship as between a given independent agency and other bodies of the state, all using terms as vague and difficult to understand as "connected," "responsible to," "under monitoring from" and the like.  The fact that these terms were not elaborated on was quite frustrating to the Court, as it would be to anyone seeking to understand the provisions.</p>

<p>In the more salient part of the opinion, the Court effectively distinguished as between two forms of relationship--"connection" <em>(irtibat)</em> and everything else.  The former term referred to the power of the body in question to establish general policies over the agency, though it did not authorize interference in day to day decision-making or expenses, as these are agencies which are supposed to be independent "financially and independently."  All other terms, whether they be "responsible," "monitoring" or anything else, were used exclusively as concerned legislative control, and thus they referred to the normal functions of a parliament to exercise authority over any branch of the executive.  </p>

<p>The problem, however, lay in the part of the opinion that dealt with <em>residual authority</em>.  This comes in two forms.  The first is that even as for those agencies that are considered to be "connected" to the legislature, the executive branch has some level of supervisory control over them, in keeping with its core executive functions as set out in Article 80(1) of the Constitution.   More troubling, as for those agencies where no connection is mentioned at all, including the all-important Central Bank and the Independent High Electoral Commission, the Court held that the executive holds the power to establish general policies, meaning such agencies are by implication "connected" to the executive.  Legislatures globally by their nature, the Court reasoned, cannot exercise such powers of policy setting, and thus in the absence of clear constitutional directive, and given (in the Court's mind) the need to connect these bodies to some branch of government that is accountable, the executive is the only possibility. </p>

<p>To some extent, the vociferous objections of members of Iraq's legislature and their insistence on the importance of maintaining the independence of agencies like the independent electoral commission might be taken with a grain of salt.  The same legislature had previously sought through legislation to exercise precisely the same level of control over the electoral commission the executive now possesses, by declaring the commission "connected" to the legislature in law even though the Constitution had said no such thing.  But self-serving diatribes aside, the concern remains. One hardly wants independent agencies like a Central Bank and an electoral commission to be excessively influenced by any political branch, and the Court's language, while stressing some level of independence, does subject them to the broad policy guidelines of the executive.  </p>

<p>Moreover, to continue with the criticism, it is fair to compare the reasoning of Decision 88 of 2010 with Decision 43 of 2010, where the Court interpreted Article 60 of the Constitution as denying the right of the legislature to make its own laws.  In that case, the Court indicated, properly, that Article 60(1) permits a "bill" to be presented by the executive to the legislature, and Article 60(2) only permits members and legislative committees to offer "recommendations of law."  The latter, the Court concluded, were supposed to be recommendations provided to the executive, to be turned into bills.   Leaving aside precisely what the purpose of a Constitution authorizing a "recommendation" of this sort is (couldn't any human being offer such a "recommendation" to Iraq's executive after all?), the reasoning is linguistically plausible given the odd distinction provided in Article 60.  Still, in decision 88, the Court was quick to point to the lack of legislatures globally to set policies for agencies.  If it had done the reverse in Decision 43 - if, that is, the Court had considered the general powers of legislatures globally, it surely would have noted that legislatures might not be generally empowered to set powers for agencies, but they are amply empowered to make their own laws.  The Court could also have read the general legislative power set forth in Article 61 (1) to "enact the federal legislation" in connection with Decision 43 as broadly as it read the powers of the executive to oversee government bodies in Article 80(1) in connection with Decision 88 and found residual power for the legislature in Decision 43 similar to that it granted to the executive in Decision 88.  </p>

<p>May we conclude from these cases that the Court is simply in the current Prime Minister's employ and is authorizing the rise of an incipient dictatorship as some in Iraq's parliament would attest?  Certainly not, as the Court does not always side with the executive.  Not only did it rule against his coalition on electoral results, it also ordered an ally of his removed from a post as provincial governor, and it recently held, over the executive's strong objection, in Decision 68 of 2010 that a recent Civil Service Commission Law was validly enacted even if the executive had second thoughts about submitting it.  The final of these should not be discounted. Such a commission has the potential to reduce considerably the executive power over personnel decisions, whether or not it is "connected" to the executive.  </p>

<p>Moreover, it does have to be noted that the executive's power to submit legislation and to set policy for independent agencies does not lie with the Prime Minister himself, but the Council of Ministers.  In many nations, that might not matter, as the Prime Minister controls his cabinet effectively.  In Iraq, this is hardly true, and in fact, until the recent decision, the criticism of Iraq's executive was that it was too broad-based, too weak, and too diffuse to be effective.  Surely it cannot both be ineffective because power is diffused too broadly within it and also be the vehicle for another centralized dictatorship at the same time.</p>

<p>But most importantly, and to get to the solution that naturally arises given the above, as the Court noted, Iraq is a parliamentary system, <em>and the legislature has ample tools to check executive power</em>.  It can call the heads of independent agencies in for questioning and ask about excessive executive interference. It can investigate credible claims of the same by a minister or the entire Council of Ministers.  It can even bring down the government through a vote of no confidence.  This is to say nothing of the fact that the Court has limited the extent of executive interference in independent agencies in its opinion. While the executive might have the powers implied by "connection," in all likelihood what that might mean as opposed to unlawful interference in individual instances is going to be litigated again.  We are at the beginning, that is, of a long period of wrangling as between different government branches.  One setback via a less than ideal decision, in a parliamentary democracy, is not a time for despair, only one for recalibration of efforts among competing authorities.</p>

		<title>FRANCE and UK: Securing the Confidentiality of Information in International Arbitration Law: the Effect of National Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anna Mandel, Boston College '11, writes about confidentiality obligations imposed by courts of arbitration and host governments in France and the United Kingdom...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>C</strong></font>onfidentiality has historically been an attractive element of international commercial arbitration because it is paramount for respondent companies to keep the content of negative allegations unavailable to the public. On the other hand, claimants often wish to expose the existence of a dispute and the monetary damages involved in order to posture themselves as strong and assertive while portraying the respondents as malevolent. Claimants often seek advice from their attorneys on whether they can publish information about an on-going arbitration, especially between a large, well-known respondent corporation and a smaller, lesser-known claimant company. </p>

<p>However, according to a recent international arbitration survey, parties sometimes make the dangerous assumption that confidentiality obligations apply even when an agreement or institutional rule is silent on confidentiality protection. In such cases, national rules on confidentiality in international arbitration would apply. For corporations concerned with keeping information surrounding arbitration confidential, local laws drive decisions on where to hold arbitration. For instance, London and Paris are both popular seats of arbitration, but maintain differing national laws on confidentiality. </p>

<p>A duty of confidentiality can come from a wide variety of sources, including an agreement, institutional rule, or national law. If an agreement specifies parties' duties of confidentiality, a tribunal normally respects the agreement. However, there are certain narrowly drawn circumstances in which the public interest may outweigh parties' rights to confidentiality, such as when public entities or States are involved in disputes. If no confidentiality agreement exists, lawyers review institutional rules such as those of the International Court of Arbitration of the <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a> (ICC) in Paris, or the <a href="http://www.lcia.org/">London Court of International Arbitration</a> (LCIA). </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/uploadedFiles/Court/Arbitration/other/rules_arb_english.pdf">ICC Rules</a> [PDF] are silent on confidentiality, except for the broad stipulation that a tribunal must "take measures for protecting ... confidential information." If no agreement delimits confidentiality obligations, national laws would apply under an ICC arbitration. To contrast, in keeping with English law's general rule that confidentiality is inherent in private proceedings, the LCIA provides extensive <a href="http://www.lcia.org/Dispute_Resolution_Services/LCIA_Arbitration_Rules.aspx">rules</a> on confidentiality, including a default duty of confidentiality refutable only by the express written consent of the parties. However, the duty is accompanied by disclosure exceptions for protecting other legal duties, pursuing legal rights, or enforcing or challenging awards in State courts. Such exceptions touch private legal interests, and national case law is often used to determine when an exception would apply.</p>

<p>Consulting national laws on confidentiality is therefore indispensible when agreements or institutional rules are silent, or when suspicion exists that private interests may override the obligations of confidentiality. Various approaches for filling such a lacuna in the confidentiality legal framework exist: civil law-based States, such as France, tend to favor confidentiality rights with very limited statutory exceptions, while common law States, such as England, provide protection with enumerated exceptions elaborated by case law. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/contents">UK Arbitration Act</a> does not mention confidentiality, but English case law provides an extensive analysis of the topic. Under English law, an implicit duty of confidentiality exists with the conclusion of an arbitration agreement. The duty is based on the principle that arbitration is a private, and consequently confidential, dispute resolution process. Exceptions to this common law principle exist, however. Companies seeking to protect sensitive information and still allow room to reveal information when necessary to protect their interests may therefore look to London as a seat of arbitration.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.uniset.ca/lloydata/css/19901WLR1205.html"><em>Dolling-Baker</em></a> case articulated the concept of implied confidentiality. The court prohibited one party from disclosing transcripts and an award from a previous arbitral hearing in court. The court affirmed that confidentiality is an "implied obligation arising out of the nature of arbitration itself." However, it hinted at the possibility of exceptions: "if ... disclosure and inspection is necessary for the fair disposal of the action." Such fairness exceptions were expanded in subsequent case law as private interests weighed against confidentiality protections, such as when the interests of justice collide with the implied confidentiality principle when disclosure of information surrounding an arbitration is "reasonably necessary for the establishment or protection of an arbitrating party's legal rights vis-a-vis a third party." The English court tries to protect individual rights insofar as disclosure of information is necessary to secure them; if it merely assists, the exception would not be met. </p>

<p>Further exceptions based on consent, court order, reasonable necessity and the interest of justice were also outlined in a ship-building contract dispute case, <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1997/3054.html"><em>Ali Shipping</em></a>. The confidential information in question was found in an arbitral award, opening submissions and two witness transcripts of oral evidence. One of the parties wished to rely on these documents to refute the allegations of the opposing side, but, citing the reasonableness analysis, the court confirmed that implying confidentiality into an existing contract would depend on "whether it is necessary ... [in order] to give business efficacy" to the contract, thereby necessary to establish or protect the arbitrating party's legal rights vis-a-vis a third party. Before allowing the appeal, the Court required proof of the reasonable necessity of disclosure. </p>

<p>English law thus provides a fair balance between protecting confidential information and ensuring due process by maintaining an implied duty of confidentiality with reasonably necessary private interest exceptions. For commercial actors seeking this type of balance, London is a good choice for arbitration.</p>

<p>In contrast, France, a civil law State, imposes one of the highest duties of confidentiality among popular international arbitration jurisdictions; the duty in France is subject only to a statutory right of information. According to the Paris Court of Appeal in the leading case, <em>Aita v Ojjeh</em>, "it is in the very nature of arbitration proceedings to ensure that the highest level of secrecy governs the resolution of private disputes in accordance with the parties' agreement." The Court ruled that disclosing a previously-rendered arbitral award by attempting to challenge the award in French national court violated the implied obligation of confidentiality of information. It found that challenging the previously-rendered arbitral award in French national court was jurisdictionally improper, and so the act of disclosing the award violated confidentiality. In <em>True North v Publicis</em>, the Paris Commercial Court confirmed that arbitration was a private procedure having a confidential character. True North was fined and prohibited from further publishing information regarding the existence of arbitration with the advertising agency Publicis. </p>

<p>Companies seeking such strong confidentiality protections may therefore look to Paris, where the ICC is headquartered, as a seat of arbitration. Since the confidentiality of information makes arbitration an appealing alternative to litigation, national legislation on international arbitration can alter the arbitral landscape by encouraging (or discouraging) commercial actors to choose certain jurisdictions. In fact, French arbitration law was recently modified to this end. While the new law only applies to domestic arbitration, it is meant to modernize and strengthen existing international arbitration practices, in order to maintain Paris as a popular arbitral seat. In this way, it is easy to see how domestic law often influences companies to act, just as commercial actors' needs or preferences may influence the creation or modification of law. Commercial actors therefore work reciprocally with the law, and this national legislative attention will continue to play an important role in maintaining certain jurisdictions as centers of international commercial arbitration in the future. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href=http://www.mideastmonitor.org/gambill/>Gary C. Gambill</a> [Editor, <a href=http://www.mideastmonitor.org/> Mideast Monitor</a>]:

                "Last month, an extraordinarily popular uprising against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was interrupted by a turn of events that is not uncommon when aging autocrats outlive their capacity to protect deeply vested interests - a bloodless seizure of power by generals promising a transition to democracy. Though the Supreme Military Council (SMC) appears committed to transferring power to a newly elected civilian government, its transition plan is designed to forestall the kind of systemic political reform needed to sustain democracy in Egypt. The <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12793484>constitutional referendum</a> this weekend may well determine if it succeeds.</p>

                <p>While the Egyptian military is widely respected by the public (owing to familiarity born of universal conscription and the fact that soldiers haven't been used to police the population), it is anything but a neutral arbiter in the struggle for political power. Its extensive penetration of the state's civilian organs (every president of Egypt and most regional governors have come from its ranks), institutional autonomy, and accumulation of vast, untaxed commercial enterprises make it by far the most powerful and united stakeholder of the <em>ancien regime</em> (evident in the ease with which it brushed Mubarak aside).</p>

                <p>The military's privileged status is symbiotically linked to the "super-presidential" political system laid down by Egypt's 1971 <a href=http://www.uam.es/otroscentros/medina/egypt/egypolcon.htm>constitution</a>, which grants the president a host of extraordinary powers (unilaterally dismissing the prime minister, dissolving parliament, imposing emergency law, etc.), without strong legislative and judicial checks. Under this system, the military needs only the cooperation of this one civilian officeholder to rule from the shadows. While most who played leading roles in the "January 25 Revolution" believe that the constitutional powers of the presidency must be drastically scaled back or abolished altogether in favor of a parliamentary system, the transition process mandated by the SMC is structured to preserve them.</p>

                <p>The council's six-month deadline for holding legislative and presidential elections works to the advantage of incumbents and others who have the financial resources and organizational capacities to quickly mount effective campaigns - mainly the remnants of Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) and the Muslim Brotherhood. Although a committee of prominent jurists handpicked by the SMC has drafted a series of constitutional amendments - set to go to referendum on Saturday - that will demonstrably enhance the integrity and transparency of the electoral process (in particular by restoring judicial supervision of elections and reducing restrictions on who can run for president), it is quite possible that political newcomers who spearheaded the demonstrations in Tahrir Square will be all but shut out of parliament (particularly if the country's winner-take-all electoral system remains in effect).</p>

                <p>Conspicuously ignoring the consensus of legal experts that a new constitution should be written by a constituent assembly elected for this sole purpose (which eliminates the inherent conflict of interest in rulers of government choosing the rules of government), the SMC has assigned this task to the very parliament it is rushing to instate.
                    It apparently anticipates that the principal beneficiaries of quick elections will oppose a major constitutional overhaul (NDP business elites can be bought off, while Islamists favor a strong presidency so long as they are allowed to freely compete for it), and there is widespread suspicion among pro-democracy activists that it reached a prior understanding with the Muslim Brotherhood to this effect. No matter who wins the presidency, the next occupant will have a clear interest in preserving the prerogatives of his office, a large bloc of parliamentary supporters, and considerable incentives to appease the military.</p>

                <p>In hopes of forcing the SMC to abandon its transition plan, most leaders of the January 25 uprising have urged the Egyptian public to vote against the interim constitutional amendments (without which elections cannot proceed), while the Muslim Brotherhood and what's left of the NDP are mobilizing their supporters to vote in favor.</p>

                <p>Much hangs in the balance. Although accelerated elections would still be the most transparent in Egyptian history and some improvement in constitutional provisions for political and civil rights is inevitable at this point, an SMC victory in the referendum will probably rule out sweeping structural changes to Egypt's system of government. In countries with a long legacy of authoritarian rule, presidential systems nearly always fail to provide for successful transitions to democracy. While former Soviet bloc countries that chose parliamentary systems after the fall of communism have overwhelmingly remained democratic, those with presidential systems (e.g. Russia, Ukraine) have regressed into tyranny. Without a constitution far better suited to escaping its authoritarian past, Egypt will have a very uphill struggle for democracy."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.psu.edu/faculty/resident_faculty/romero">Victor Romero</a> of Penn State's Dickinson School of Law says the current U.S. immigration system is broken.  Many states have created their own immigration laws, purportedly in accordance with federal policy, but these state laws cannot possibly capture the nuances of the federal system.  If states create their own regimes, we may end up with a more complicated system than we have currently...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Victor_Romero.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>R</b></font>egardless of one's political leanings, there is one thing upon which most agree:  The current U.S. immigration system is broken.  Given Congress's failure to fix the problem, what's a frustrated state or city to do?  Although the federal government grants noncitizens permission to reside in the United States, the states and municipalities more directly feel the impact of their presence, because - just like U.S. citizens - noncitizens shape their communities economically, politically, and culturally, simply by living and working there.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, states and localities have increasingly sought to address immigrant issues to both fill the gap and prompt federal action.  The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that the number of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=20244">state laws and resolutions increased almost nine-fold</a> from 39 in 2005 to 346 in 2010.  </p>

<p>Given the high profile enjoyed by <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">Arizona's controversial criminal trespass law [pdf]</a>, many in the public assume that state and local government laws are uniformly anti-immigrant.  While it is true that many of these initiatives are aimed at curbing irregular migration by limiting access to employment, driver's licenses, and public benefits, many resolutions celebrate America's ethnic diversity, supporting efforts to integrate new immigrants and refugees.  </p>

<p>Perhaps predictably, the split appears to be along "legal"/"illegal" lines:  State resolutions welcoming migrants extend only to those who are here legally (immigrants and refugees), while laws that retract that welcome mat do so for those who are not here legally (undocumented and irregular migrants).  Put another way, states and localities do not wish to create their own immigration regimes.  They simply wish to supplement the national government's efforts.  If federal immigration officials welcome a noncitizen, so should the states; in contrast, those denied entry or who have overstayed their visas should be encouraged to leave.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's not easy to separate the "legal" from "illegal" under current federal law.</p>

<p>While it is true that Congress tends to distinguish between those who are lawfully present and those who are not, our complex immigration regime allows for exceptions and waivers, where individual cases demand it.  For instance, overstaying a visa will not separate a single mother from her four U.S. citizen children where she can prove her deportation will cause exceptional and extreme hardship to them.  Similarly, Congress will occasionally issue a private bill to negate a deportee's removal, if it deems the person worthy of such legislative grace.  Finally, victims of domestic violence at the hands of their U.S. citizen spouses will not be deported, but instead allowed to self-petition to correct their status and move on with their lives.</p>

<p>Thus, while these state laws purport to rely on existing federal immigration laws, they cannot possibly capture the nuance and complexity of such laws, especially as applied to individual cases.  A state trespass law based on one's federal undocumented status may well end up complicating matters rather than simplifying them, given state officers' unfamiliarity with immigration law.  And if every state passes a slightly different trespass law, with different state law enforcement officers struggling to enforce it fairly, we may find ourselves in an even more complicated situation than we have currently.  </p>

<p>A critic might argue that denying states a role in immigration control devalues federalism.  State governments have inherent authority to regulate traditional areas of local concern for the health, safety, and welfare of their communities.  This means protecting state citizens from foreign nationals who have no right to be here, especially as the latter affect the local economy.  But even assuming one could easily distinguish local problems from national ones in our increasingly global marketplace, to the extent the impetus for local action is the impact of foreign citizens, then the federal government's interest in protecting U.S. citizens may well parallel state concerns. </p>

<p>A second argument claims that to let undocumented persons roam free is to undermine the rule of law.  Whether unauthorized border crossers or visa over stayers, the undocumented have no right to be here; their very presence makes a mockery of the legal system and unfairly disadvantages those who wait patiently in line.  While it appeals to principle, this critique fails to persuade when viewed from the ground.  First, when invoked in the context of irregular migration, this "rule of law" argument neglects the reality of selective law enforcement and citizen obedience.  No recent President has argued that, given our scarce law enforcement resources, all deportable noncitizens should be deported.  Prosecutorial discretion has dictated channeling resources toward those who are serious threats to the country through their criminal or subversive behavior.  This argument also rings hollow given the citizenry's selective approach to law obeisance.  Some of those who invoke the rule of law find little difficulty driving past the legal speed limit, jaywalking in a major city, or littering on a public highway.  </p>

<p>Finally, and fundamentally, the invocation of the rule of law should prompt us to ask the question whether the underlying law we are being asked to follow is a good one.  Is the line that we've drawn between "lawful" and "unlawful" migration sound?  When dealing with the undocumented, would it be better to remove or encourage attrition through self-deportation, or to find more avenues for the vast majority of them to come out of the shadows and be counted?  And to prevent undocumented migration, would it be better to punish transgressors with ever increasing sanctions, or to develop more legal avenues for short-term migration, with the possibility of permanent residence?  These are exactly the hard questions we should be asking ourselves when confronted with the naked invocation of the rule of law.</p>

		<title>India and Pakistan: A Tale of Judicial Appointments</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="font-weight: normal">JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/faculty/law/shubhankard.asp">Shubhankar Dam</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/index.asp">Singapore Management University School of Law</a> says that recent judicial appointments in India and Pakistan have led to battles between their respective judicial and executive branches...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/SHUBHANKARD.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b><t></b></font></div><div style="font-weight:normal">In a moment of remarkable constitutional coincidence, two appointments were set aside in India and Pakistan last week. First, India's Supreme Court invalidated the appointment of P. J. Thomas to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Days later, Pakistan's Supreme Court invalidated Deedar Shah's appointment to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).

<p>The CVC and the NAB have similar mandates; they are central to anti-corruption efforts in both countries. The allegations were similar as well. Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of the Opposition in India, objected to Thomas' candidacy. Criminal investigations were pending against him, and that, Swaraj argued, made him unfit for the post. And to Chaudhry Nisar, the Leader of the Opposition in Pakistan, Shah's long association with the ruling Pakistan People's Party made him unfit for an independent office. Eventually, both matters ended up in the respective Supreme Courts as public interest litigations, and both succeeded.</p>

<p>While judges in Pakistan are yet to offer their detailed reasoning, the short order when compared with the full decision in India suggests that largely similar issues were at stake. Without supposedly casting aspersions on Thomas' personal integrity, India's Supreme Court concluded that his appointment undermines the institutional integrity of the CVC.  The CVC stands for certain values, and his past is not in consonance with the duties to be discharged by that office.</p>

<p>Much of the Court's focus was on the CVC, its independence and impartiality and how individuals fit into that scheme. And while a candidate may be technically qualified, larger questions of "fit" must be taken into taken into account when making those appointments. "The institution and its integrity, including institutional competence and functioning, and not the desirability of the candidate alone," the Court said, must be looked into.</p>

<p>Though there are good reasons to applaud the Court's conclusion, the distinction between personal and institutional integrity is suspect; the two seem to go together. A person of impeccable integrity would be expected to uphold institutional integrity. Conversely, someone lacking in personal integrity is unlikely to further institutional integrity. The distinction merely seems to hint at a simpler idea: appointees to impartial offices must not only act impartially, but appear capable of doing so. And there are good reasons to wonder if Thomas' tarnished past brings into question that possibility.</p>

<p>Chaudhry Nisar, in his petition to the Supreme Court, made similar arguments in Pakistan. The NAB is investigating cases against President Zardari. Appointing an acolyte to the chairpersonship of that body undermines its institutional integrity; Shah's independence would be suspect in these circumstances. Or, to use the earlier language, while Shah's personal integrity may be matchless, his political association may appear to undermine the NAB's impartiality. To be sure, the Court hasn't declared its full reasoning yet, but given the uncanny factual and legal similarities, it will be worth watching if a similar personal-institutional distinction is relied upon in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Two things are worth pointing out here. While the zealous desire to guard these agencies from corrupt influences is intuitively appealing, getting the right people to the positions is only half the task. Presumably, what they do in those posts is equally important. And secondly, admirable as this "war" on corruption is, one would expect judges to exercise the same degree of intrusive probing in matters relating to their own appointments.</p>

<p>Judicial corruption, or at least allegations thereof, has reached epic proportions in India. There is an ongoing investigation against the relatives of the former Chief Justice for amassing wealth disproportionate to the known sources of income. This week, the Central Bureau of Investigation filed chargesheets against a sitting High Court judge on allegations of corruption. All this, barely weeks after a formal motion to impeach a former High Court judge was tabled in Parliament. The scene in Pakistan, one suspects, is not altogether different.</p>

<p>Judicial appointments, despite recent changes in Pakistan and proposed changes in India, remain monopolized: judges largely appoint themselves and if these self-appointing judges are to remain the guardians of constitutional values and good governance in South Asia, it is not too late to hold them to the same standards of probity as they have come to expect of other equal branches of government.  The law, as judges often remind others, must apply equally.</p>

<p>The immediate appointment drama, however, continues. India's Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, has apologized to an extent for his role in the appointment. Thomas himself, however, is in no mood to acquiesce. He has declared his intention to file a "curative" petition in the Supreme Court for a review of the decision. The reverse is true in Pakistan; President Zardari is in no mood to oblige and is exploring options to make the appointment retroactively valid. Despite this, Shah, the appointee in the middle of the controversy, has resigned, and stated that he has no intention of challenging the verdict.</p>

<p>The war on corruption is turning into a war between the courts and the executive. And there is surely more to come. </p>

Although Arab and Muslim countries had joined the coalition against their Arab and Muslim neighbor, none of them actually participated in the airstrikes by sending aircraft.<br />
 <br />
The attacks came after the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1973. In response to this resolution the Libyan government had officially called a ceasefire in the civil war that it was waging against armed rebels whose base is in Benghazi. Libya also announced that its airspace was closed. Western leaders responded to these actions by the Libyan government by claiming that they could not be believed and arguing that the fighting was continuing. Indeed, Libyan sources confirmed that the civil war was ongoing and that both sides continued to attack each other. On Saturday, 19 March, the Libyan rebels announced that a Libyan government fighter had been shot down over Tripoli.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Resolution 1973</strong><br />
 <br />
Resolution 1973 was adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter with 10 votes for, none against and 5 abstentions. Voting for it were the Council's permanent members United States, Britain, France and non-permanent members Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Gabon, Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal, and South Africa. Abstaining were permanent members Russia, China and non-permanent members Germany, Brazil, and India.<br />
 <br />
The resolution was adopted on Thursday, 17 March 2011 just after 18:30 local time in New York. American Ambassador Susan Rice described as strengthening the sanctions and travel bans in earlier resolution 1970.<br />
 <br />
It was promoted by the French and United Kingdom governments, but with the strong presence of the United States in the background pulling the strings. <br />
 <br />
At the meeting was the new French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Although as former Prime Minister he was not new to the UN, he arrived just weeks after his predecessor had been replaced for having accepted favours from a Libyan businessmen and just days after his government became the first Western government to recognize the forces fighting against the government in Libya's raging civil war as the legitimate representatives of the country.<br />
 <br />
The Libyan government did not have a representative present at the meeting after its nominated Ambassador, former President of the General Assembly Ali Abdelsalem Treki was denied admission to the United States.  Nevertheless, although officially relieved of his duties more than a week ago for defecting to the opposition former Deputy Permanent Representative Ibrahim O. A. Dabbashi was on hand at the Security Council Media Stakeout on Wednesday to make a statement and take questions.<br />
 <br />
Resolution 1973 contains 29 operative paragraphs divided into eight sections.<br />
 <br />
The first section calls for an "immediate cease-fire" in its first paragraph and for respect for international law including "the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance." <br />
 <br />
A curious second operational paragraph "stresses the need to intensify efforts to find a solution to the crisis" and goes on to qualify this as responding "to the legitimate demands of the Libyan people" and leading to "the political reforms necessary to find a peaceful and sustainable solution." Such vague and board language leaves open both the question of which Libyans legitimate demands must be met and what political reforms are necessary. Legally these requirements also appear to be a direct interference with Libya's internal affairs in violation of article 2(7) of the UN Charter, which all UN Security Council resolutions are bound to respect according to article 25 of the Charter. This apparently irreconcilable discrepancy will fuel speculation that the resolution is another example of politics refusing to respect international law.<br />
 <br />
Paragraphs 4 and 5 concern the protection of civilians with the latter paragraph focusing on the regional responsibility of the League of Arab States.<br />
 <br />
The largest operative part of the resolution is then devoted to the creation of a no-fly zone in paragraphs 6 through 12. Article 6 creates the no-fly zone "on all flights in the airspace of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in order to help protect civilians." Paragraph 7 then enumerates several humanitarian exceptions.<br />
 <br />
It is perhaps paragraph 8 that will focus the mind of most international lawyers where it states that States may "take all necessary measures to enforce compliance with the ban on flights." The use of the term "all necessary measures" opens the door to the use of force.<br />
 <br />
Paragraphs 13 through 16 call for an arms embargo and "[d]eplores the continuing flows of mercenaries" into the Libya. In doing so paragraph 13 decides that paragraph 11 of resolution 1970 (2011) shall be replaced with a new paragraph that "authorises Member States to use all measures commensurate to the specific circumstances to carry out such inspections." Again this language indicates that force may be used against seafaring vessels suspected of carrying arms to Libya in violation of the embargo.<br />
 <br />
In paragraphs 17 and 18 States are required to deny take off, landing or overfly rights to "any aircraft registered in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya or owned or operated by Libyan nationals or companies."<br />
 <br />
Paragraphs 19 to 21 extend the asset freeze imposed by paragraph 17, 19, 20 and 21 of resolution 1970 (2011) to "all funds, other financial assets and economic resources" that are "owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Libyan authorities ... or by individuals or entities acting on their behalf or at their direction, or by entities owned or controlled by them."<br />
 <br />
Paragraphs 22 and 23 extend the travel restrictions and the asset freeze in resolution 1970 (2011).<br />
 <br />
Paragraph 24 creates a new body, a Panel of experts, to assist the Committee created in Resolution 1970, to "[g]ather, examine and analyse information from States, relevant United Nations bodies, regional organisations and other interested parties regarding the implementation of the measures" in resolution 1970, to "[m]ake recommendations ... to improve implementation of the relevant measures," and to "[p]rovide to the Council an interim report on its work no later than 90 days after the Panel's appointment, and a final report to the Council no later than 30 days prior to the termination of its mandate with its findings and recommendations."<br />
Paragraph 27 says all States "shall take the necessary measures to ensure that no claim shall lie ... in connection with any contract or other transaction where its performance was affected by reason of the measures taken by the Security Council in resolution 1970 (2011), this resolution and related resolutions."<br />
 <br />
Finally, in penultimate paragraph 29, the Council "[d]ecides to remain actively seized of the matter."<br />
 <br />
<strong>Public Perceptions</strong><br />
 <br />
By the time the resolution was in the public domain the press British tabloids and broadsheets were already rallying the world to war. The French were convening a meeting being described as the planning meeting to use force. And while the American President was remaining cautiously ambiguous, other American officials were openly calling for military intervention in what had by now become a civil war in Libya.<br />
 <br />
In the emotional fury, international law seems to have been forgotten. One BBC commentator went so far as to suggest that political support for a no-fly zone by the Arab League was a legal justification for the use of force. Obviously, the use of force in Afghanistan and Iraq, which are widely considered as violating international law, seem not to have had much an impression on the British journalists.<br />
 <br />
Journalists elsewhere have also seemed oblivious to the international law in their consideration of Libya often calling for the invasion of this sovereign country by force despite not only the fact that article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations prohibits such a use of force, but so too does the language of Resolution 1973 itself.<br />
 <br />
Even opponents of the use of force seem unaware of the applicable international law. British MP Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons, for example, asked, if we use force against Libya to protect one side in a civil war, why don't we use it in Bahrain were dozens of unarmed protesters have been killed by national and foreign forces or in Yemen where about fifty peaceful protesters were slaughtered by army sharpshooters. This query at least appears to understand the fact that international law, to have real value in international relations, needs to similar situations in a similar manner. Failure to apply the law consistently seriously undermines the law and its restraints on international action.<br />
 <br />
<strong>International Law</strong><br />
 <br />
While decisions regarding the use of force against Libya seem to have been based more on emotions than on an understanding of the relevant facts, international law is not irrelevant. International law will continue to reflect the general rules that States use in their relations with each other long after the end of the armed conflict in Libya.  They are also, one might suggest crucial to peace and security in a world made up of people of diverse values and interests.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps the most fundamental principle of international law is that no State shall use force against another State. This principle is expressly stated in article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations.  No State can violate this principle of international and neither can the UN Security Council according to article 24(2) of the UN Charter that requires that the Council "shall act in accordance with the Principles and Purposes of the United Nations."<br />
 <br />
Narrow exceptions to the prohibition of the use of force are found in article 51 and Chapter VII of the Charter. The latter provisions, especially article 42, allow the Security Council to take action that "may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security."  Both resolutions 1970 and 1973 state that they are being adopted under Chapter VII. Neither, however, meets the requirements of article 42 that a determination has been made that "measures not involving the use of force" have failed.<br />
 <br />
In a civil war it is hard to see how such a determination can be made. It would appear that at the very least it would have to be based on on-the-ground fact-finding. Fact-finding missions by the UN Human Rights Council and the Security Council have not yet gone to Libya. While there is little doubt Western governments, such as the United States have significant abilities to determine what is happening in Libya with distant surveillance methods, this does not provide sufficient evidence of whether the government of Libya is complying with the Security Council's resolutions. Only on-the-ground observers can determine this as we have seen from the misinformation spread about Iraq's actions based on third party and distant surveillance sources.<br />
 <br />
Moreover the evidence of Libya's compliance is mixed. Libya almost immediately announced it would respect the terms of Resolutions 1973 after it was adopted. Nevertheless, in an unprecedented show of a lack of diplomatic intolerance and without confirmations of the facts on the ground Western leaders called the Libyan leader a liar.<br />
 <br />
Libya has also offered to accept international monitors, even extending invitations to them to visit their country. And in an extraordinary concession, the Libyan leader sent a message to the armed opposition when they had the upper hand and were approaching Tripoli, offering to step down and leave the country. It was only after this offer was rejected and opposition leaders said it was non-negotiable that the Libyan leader be captured and killed that the government's troops launched their offensive.<br />
 <br />
If international law allows States to use force in very limited circumstances, there are even fewer circumstances in which non-state actors are allowed to use force. One of those circumstances is when the right to self-determination is being exercised against a foreign and oppressive occupying power. This might entitle Iraqis or Afghanis to use force against occupying armies, but it would not entitle the Libyan people to use force against their own government.<br />
 <br />
Even the extrajudicial right of revolution that many international lawyers admit exists when the limits of the law have been reached has not been explicitly relied on by the Libyan rebels. If it had there may have been problems. While participation in the governance of Libya might have been a widespread problem, the country had the highest per capita income in Africa and among the best Millennium Development Goals indicators. Moreover, Libya has shown itself to respect international law in the past, implementing judgments of the International Court of Justice in the conflict with Chad and even turning over suspects for which there was questionable evidence for trial abroad in the Lockerbie affair.<br />
 <br />
Finally, the question of self-defense is relevant to the use of force against Libya. Rather than justifying the Western attack against Libya, however, it would appear to justify action taken by Libya against Western interests. In other words, as Libya has been the object of an armed attack that is likely illegal under international law, it has the right to defend itself. This right includes carrying out attacks against military facilities or personnel from any country involved in the attack. In other words, the attack against Libya by France and the United States makes the military facilities and personnel of these countries legitimate targets for attacks carried out by Libya in self-defense.<br />
 <br />
Regardless of the legality of the use of force by any party to the armed conflict, international humanitarian law or the laws of war will continue to apply. According to this law, all States involved in an armed conflict must take care not to attack civilians. The Libyan authorities alleged they were respecting this restriction in the civil war, although the rebels refuted this claim. International humanitarian law requires that the western forces may not be directed against civilians or civilian facilities in Libya and that Libya's right of self-defense must be exercised in such a way that it does not attack civilians or civilian facilities.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps the greatest harm to humanity will be the long-term effects on international affairs from the use of force in a manner that is outside of the allowed exceptions of international law. In the Pact of Paris in 1928 and again in the UN Charter in 1945, States agreed not to use force against each other to accomplish their foreign policy ends.  The Western world has appeared to repeatedly challenge this agreement in the last ten years, especially by its willingness to take military action against predominately Muslim States. In doing so they have sent an undeniable signal to the international community through their actions and despite some of their words, that international law does not matter to them. If this message is not answered by the proponents of international law then the advances we have made to ensure that the international community respects the rule of law may be undone for future generations.</p>

Kelly</a>, Professor of Law and Associate Dean for Faculty Research and International Programs at <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/">Creighton University School of Law </a>says that, for now, President Obama has the legal authority to commit U.S. military forces to establish the no-fly zone over Libya...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Kelly_150x200.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n March 19, 2011, a coalition of nations began air combat missions over the coastal areas of Libya to establish a no-fly zone, designed to protect civilians protesting Col. Muammar Gaddafi's rule from further bombardment by his military. The United States is part of that coalition.  Since President Barack Obama committed U.S. military forces, questions have been raised over the President's legal authority to undertake this action. <br />
 <br />
An American president contemplating significant military engagement abroad typically needs two authorizations for use of force: one international, the other domestic.  International legal authority can stem from sources such as the United Nations Charter or the North Atlantic Charter.  For example, in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.N. Security Council authorized force.  In Afghanistan, the locus of legal authority was the U.N. Charter's self-defense provisions together with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter - triggering NATO action.  In the Iraq War, there was no such international legal authority other than a shaky analogy to pre-U.N. Charter customary law.  Thus, that war was widely deemed illegal under international law. <br />
 <br />
In this case, the Security Council voted to authorize military action under <a href="  http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">resolution 1973</a>.  Despite what <a href="http://jurist.org/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">Curtis Doebbler</a> contends, it was generally understood to constitute the necessary authorization.  Moreover, his argument that <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 42</a> was not complied with is disingenuous.  Doebbler argues it does not meet "the requirements of article 42 that a determination has been made that 'measures not involving the use of force' have failed."  In fact Art. 42 contains no such requirement.  It merely says "should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate, or have proved to be inadequate, it may take [military action]. . . ."  The preamble to 1973 clearly indicates the Council considered such efforts would have proven inadequate and, given the exigencies of the situation (Gaddafi's troops closing on Benghazi and his threat to find and kill rebels "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/world/africa/23libya.html?_r=1">house by house</a>"), Mr. Doebbler's recommended delay would have cost thousands of Libyan civilian lives.<br />
 <br />
As for domestic legal authority, an American president must involve Congress.  Such involvement manifests itself either actively or passively.  The president can seek a specific authorization for use of force (AUMF) from Congress prior to commencing combat operations. Or he can rely on the already enacted <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/crs/RL32267.html#_1_21">1973 War Powers Resolution</a>, which to utilize is a political decision, but both may suffice.  Arguably, it is always smarter politics to involve Congress early and often with respect to major military actions.  However, President Obama chose not to do this.  He followed the path President Ronald Reagan did in 1986, when he bombed Libya without an express Congressional resolution in response to the Libyan bombing of a Berlin disco that killed several American soldiers.<br />
 <br />
Interestingly enough, every president since Richard Nixon has regarded the War Powers Resolution as an unconstitutional encroachment on his Article II executive power, but has nonetheless complied with the reporting requirements.  Under the WPR, the President may commit U.S. forces into armed hostilities, but must advise Congress within 48 hours that he has done so.  This report must explain the circumstances necessitating the deployment, the legal authority he is relying on, and the estimated scope and duration of hostilities.  A 60-day clock then begins ticking, at the end of which the president must terminate his military action unless (1) Congress has specifically authorized it, (2) Congress has extended the 60 days, or (3) Congress is physically unable to meet due to an attack on the U.S. But the President may extend the 60 days by another 30 days if he certifies to Congress that he cannot safely remove U.S. forces from combat without that additional time. <br />
 <br />
Thus, an American president operating under the WPR, basically has 92 days total to get his military business done abroad without specific Congressional authorization.  That said, Congress reserves the right to itself to pull the plug on any executive military adventures by concurrent resolution at any time.  However, no Congress has never done this and it is unlikely that any would.  President Reagan duly reported his engagement with Libya to Congress.  Likewise, President Obama duly <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/03/21/Obama-sends-War-Powers-notification/UPI-86431300749450/">reported</a> his own engagement with Libya to Congress. President Reagan's airstrikes were over quickly, so the legislative clock was not a factor.  It could be that Obama is gambling that Gaddafi will be gone within three months, thereby allowing him to "beat the clock."  But if Gaddafi is not gone, then Congressional authorization will be needed.<br />
 <br />
Again, Congressional authorization may be express or implied.  Express authorization is preferred, but frankly President Obama may have burned this bridge politically by not consulting extensively enough with Congress beforehand.  The implied, or constructive, Congressional consent can be pursued by following the Kosovo model.  There, President Clinton deployed U.S. forces to participate in a NATO-led bombing campaign against Serbia to force Slobodan Milosevic's troops out of Kosovo, where they were committing atrocities against the local population. <br />
 <br />
Clinton had neither the express backing of the U.N. nor Congress prior to this military action.  Russia, the traditional ally of Serbia would have vetoed any intervention, and Congress was still politically inhospitable to the recently impeached but acquitted president.  Instead, President Clinton used NATO for international authority and interpreted Congressional funding as domestic authority. A <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/final.htm">memo</a> from the Department of Justice concluded that  "the emergency supplemental appropriation for military operations in Kosovo, constituted authorization for continuing hostilities after the expiration at sixty days under section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution."  Obviously, this is a more tenuous legal position and perhaps one that would be ripe for litigation.  Nevertheless, the precedent is available.<br />
 <br />
The "no-fly zones" over Iraq that were established by the U.S., Britain and France traced a similarly tenuous backward route to legal authority in the Congressional and U.N. authorizations to use force in the run-up to the Persian Gulf War.  Arguably neither body originally contemplated a decade-long military presence.  American presidents must navigate tricky legal and political waters when undertaking endeavors such as establishing a "no-fly zone" or Libya.  A correct balance must be struck among several factors, not the least of which includes public acceptance, international backing, cooperation from allies, and endorsement from Congress.  Getting it right in all cases is rare.  Maintaining the security of the United States and saving lives on the ground are sometimes competing interests.  But where they dovetail, and the president summons the will to act, he is provided the tools to do so within the WPR framework.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=443">Courtney Minick</a> [Board Member, <a href="http://www.deathpenalty.org/index.php">Death Penalty Focus</a>]: "Governor Pat Quinn recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">signed a bill</a> to ban the use of the death penalty in Illinois.  The state has been wrestling with the issue of capital punishment for over ten years. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=3539&GAID=10&DocTypeID=SB&LegId=51489&SessionID=76&GA=96">Senate Bill 3539</a> was passed in both houses of the Illinois legislature, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle voting in favor of abolition.  It reflects a growing attitude nationwide that the death penalty is wasteful, flawed, and outmoded. </p>

                <p>This ban has been a long time in the making. In 2000, the Republican governor of the state, George Ryan, placed a moratorium on executions. He followed the recommendation of the <a href="http://www.idoc.state.il.us/ccp/index.html">Illinois Commission on Capital Punishment</a>, which found serious flaws the system. The Commission was convened after a series of <a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2011/03/a-toast-to-all-who-wrote-the-death-penalty-abolition-story.html">high profile</a> exonerations. Governors Blagojevich and Quinn kept the moratorium in place. </p>

                <p>Illinois is the fourth state in the country to repeal the death penalty since 2005, following New York, New Jersey, and New Mexico.  A total of 16 states and the District of Columbia no longer use the death penalty. Bills to abolish the death penalty are currently being considered in several states, including: Montana, Maryland, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas and Washington. The American Legal Institute, which promulgates the Model Penal Code, voted to remove it from the MPC this year. Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/death-sentence/?pagination=false">written critically</a> and forcefully against the death penalty. </p>

                <p>Public attitudes are shifting in this direction as well. A July 2010 Field Poll revealed that 42 percent of Californians preferred a sentence of life in prison without parole for individuals convicted of first-degree murder, while just 41 percent chose the death penalty. Editorials have favored scrapping the death penalty to save money, protect the victim family members, and spare the innocent. In California, debate rages over the unconventional and frankly bizarre methods that the government has employed to find execution drugs. </p>

                <p>Capital punishment has no place in modern civil society. It is a broken system rife with error and discrimination. It is expensive and delays justice for the victim's family. Governor Quinn did "the right, just thing" in signing this bill and eliminating capital punishment in Illinois. I hope to see other states -- including my own -- follow suit."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Remarkably the United Kingdom (UK) finds itself in a growing constitutional crisis over the disenfranchisement of prisoners. This unlikely issue has become a focal point for a set of broader constitutional questions from the rule of law through to the UK's relationship with Europe in a constitutional and political sense, and the effectiveness of the Human Rights Act.</p>

<p><strong>Prisoner Disenfranchisement</strong><br />
English law has long recognised that human rights do not end at the prison gate. A prisoner continues to enjoy such rights that are not taken away expressly or by necessary implication. However, one of the expressly denied rights is the right to vote (Section 3, Representation of the People Act 1983). Generally, prisoners suffer what is known as a civil death, irrespective of their sentence or crimes.  This penalty has long been a feature of English law, detailed in Blackstone, it can in fact be traced all the way back to antiquity.</p>

<p><strong>The British Human Rights Act</strong><br />
In 2003 the disenfranchisement of prisoners was challenged under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). The HRA gives domestic legal effect to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). But HRA did so in a limited way. The HRA does not incorporate the ECHR, but instead places public bodies under a new duty to act compatibility with Convention rights. And although the HRA creates a new modified form of judicial review of legislation, the Act went to almost comical extremes to ensure that Parliament remained sovereign. Indeed, the powers of the courts under the HRA are so weak that where legislation is found to be incompatible with the ECHR they may only issue a non-binding form of declaratory relief - the declaration of incompatibility - that is itself deficient in the terms of the Convention it seeks to protect.  In short, the HRA is a weak bill of rights that crucially lacks an effective judicial remedy in the face of incompatible legislation. Where a law is incompatible only Parliament or exceptionally the executive may remedy it.</p>

<p><strong>The Domestic Constitutional Challenge to Prisoner Disenfranchisement </strong><br />
In Hirst v. HM Attorney General [2001] EWHC Admin 239 the disenfranchisement of prisoners was challenged under the HRA. It was unsuccessfully contended that the disenfranchisement was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol 1 ECHR. The High Court ruled that 'Parliament has taken the view that for the period during which they are in custody convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed.' (para 40) In his judgment Kennedy LJ observed that 'in deference to the legislature courts should not easily be persuaded to condemn what has been done, especially where it has been done in primary legislation after careful evaluation and against a background of increasing public concern about crime.' (para 20).  Whether this was the case was debatable as the original law enacted in 1870 had only been spasmodically and cursorily reviewed since. An application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed with Simon Brown LJ concluding the case was 'jurisprudentially ... doomed.' ([2001] EWCA Civ 927, para 7).</p>

<p><strong>Popular Opinion and Bills of Rights</strong><br />
Hirst's cause may not have met with popular acclaim and support.  But such cases concern just the sort of issue that a bill of rights is intended to deal with.  The purpose of a Bill of rights is, as Jackson J observed, "to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts - one's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections." (West Virginia State Bord of Education v. Barnette 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943)) Moreover, when interpreting and applying constitutional laws it is not the business of the judicial branch to ascertain and further the vagaries of public opinion. (Reyes v. The Queen [2001] UKPC 64, para 20 Lord Bingham) Yet notwithstanding the view that that the HRA "fulfils the function of a Bill of Rights in our legal system" (McCartan Turkington Breen v. Times Newspapers [2000] 3 WLR 1670, 1686 Lord Steyn) the English courts failed to rise to the occasion by deferring unjustifiably to Parliament. </p>

<p><strong>The European Court of Human Rights</strong><br />
Having exhausted their legal remedies in the UK, the applicants then petitioned the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (European Court). Since 1966 British citizens have been able to petition the European Court, but only in cases where they have exhausted their domestic remedies. <br />
The European Court exercises a subsidiary jurisdiction. The European Court is not part of the United Kingdom's court structure. Its decisions although highly persuasive, do not bind British courts. Under the ECHR the primary responsibility for guaranteeing rights and freedoms rests with the contracting states. How states so this is a matter for them, though most have constitutional bills of rights that mirror the guarantees of the ECHR. The remedies that the European Court grants are limited too. It may grant declarations and if it thinks appropriate just satisfaction (damages). Of course as a matter of international law the contracting states agree to remedy the deficiencies in their legal order usually through a change in the law or an adjustment to executive procedures. The Committee of Ministers, composed of senior diplomats, oversees the execution of the European Court's judgments. However, the Committee's tools lack teeth.</p>

<p>The European Court was intended by its framers to act as a human rights watchdog, barking only when European states allowed the protection of human rights to drop below a minimum level. It was hoped that not only would the ECHR act as a bulwark against political extremism, but that it would also help sustain a genuine European respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy. And in this it has been remarkably successful.</p>

<p><strong>The International Challenge to Prisoner Disenfranchisement </strong><br />
In Hirst v. UK (No.2) (2006) 42 EHHR 41 the Grand Chamber of the European Court considered, as the English courts had done before, whether the blanket disenfranchisement of prisoners was compatible with the Article 3 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR. The European Court held that is was not. The total ban was disproportionate. Had the 1983 Act disenfranchised only certain classes of votes, such as those guilty of electoral fraud or of the most heinous crimes in the criminal code then it would have in all likelihood been held compatible. But the law did not. Of course, there is, in truth, nothing radical or revolutionary in the decision of the European Court. The European Court was, on one level, simply insisting that the punishment fits the crime.  Specifically the European Court held that that Article 3 of Protocol 1 includes a guarantee of individual rights, namely the right to vote and to stand for election. (para 57) In the European Court's opinion the universal suffrage is a basic constituent principle of an effective political democracy governed by the rule of law. (para 58-59). Thus the franchise is not a matter of privilege but a fundamental right. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the state may impose proportionate restrictions on the right in the pursuit of the public good (para 60). In doing so states have an area of discretionary judgment, within which they have more room for a range of policy decisions than elsewhere. (para 61) For instance, the European Court has upheld restrictions in cases where national law has imposed a minimum age of eligibility or where states have imposed residence requirements. With reference to prisoners the European Court concluded, as it has before, that such people continue to enjoy their Convention rights notwithstanding their incarceration. (para 69) No one simply forfeits his or her Convention rights simply by virtue of imprisonment. And unlike the English High Court, which was happy to defer to the will of the people expressed through Parliament, the European Court was emphatic in its dismissal of public opinion as relevant in this context: "Nor is there any place under the convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic disenfranchisement based purely on what might offend public opinion." (para 70) The Court then went on to conclude that disenfranchisement is not a measure that the state should undertake lightly save in cases where this severe penalty is connected with a legitimate aim and is executed in a proportionate manner. With respect to the restrictions in the 1983 Act the European Court accepted that the restriction pursued a legitimate aim in ensuring that voters were civically responsible individuals who had respect for the rule of law. However, the blanket restriction applying to prisoners was by definition disproportionate. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the argument of the UK government that the ban fell within the margin of appreciation received short shrift: "Such a general, automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important convention right must be seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be" (para. 83) Before disposing of the application the European Court was also critical of the way in which the disenfranchisement had been imposed: "It cannot be said that there was any substantive debate by members of the legislature on the continued justification in light of modern day penal policy and of current human rights standards for maintaining such a general restriction on the right of prisoners to vote." (Para. 79) As we shall see it was this point that was to later provide the inspiration for the backbench debate on prisoners voting.</p>

<p><strong>The Consequences of Hirst</strong><br />
Two consequences followed as a result of the Grand Chamber's judgment in Hirst. First, the UK government came under an obligation under international law to implement the judgment (Article 46 ECHR). Not surprisingly in the intervening years the then Labour administration showed little enthusiasm to do so. In fact by the time that Labour left office in 2010 it had simply carried out a protracted two-stage review of the issue (one consultation in 2006 and the other in 2009). Remarkably as part of this review process the government canvassed the option of retaining the blanket ban, the very policy found wanting in Strasbourg.  However, five years after the Grand Chamber's final ruling the incompatible law remains in identical form on the statue book. By the end of the consultation and review process the Committee of Ministers was evidently loosing patience with the UK authorities, adopting an interim resolution which expressed its serious concern that the forthcoming general election (2010) would be conducted under the same unaltered laws that the European Court had found wanting in Hirst (Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)1601). This concern and disappointment was subsequently reiterated as the UK failed to take any steps to implement the judgment. (See Decision 18, 1086th DH meeting - 3 June 2010. Decision 6, 1092nd DH meeting - 15 September 2010).</p>

<p>Second, the European Court affirmed its decision in Hirst in a series of cases:  Frodl v. Austria [2010] ECHR 20201/04, Scoppola (No 3) v Italy [2011] ECHR 126/05 and Greens v. UK [2010] ECHR 60041/08. As the European court noted in Frodl any penal sentence that disenfranchised a prisoner had to taken as a matter of discretion by the trial judge on the basis of the particular circumstances of the offence. (paras 34-35) By 2011 the principles set forth in Hirst had come to represent the clear and consistent doctrine of the European Court. Domestically, the judgment in Hirst has been considered in a number of cases (E.g. Smith v. Scott 2007 SLT 137, Chester v. Secretary of State for Justice  [2009] EWHC 2923 (Admin)). But British Courts, while now declaring the section incompatible, have quite correctly concluded that it is for Parliament to change the law.</p>

<p>The UK finds itself in something of a bind. On the one hand the Council of Europe is pressing for the UK to implement the judgment of the European Court. And on the other, members of Parliament show little appetite to do so. On 10 February 2011 the House of Commons debated prisoner disenfranchisement, ostensibly to show to the European Court that Parliament had fully considered the issue. However, the debate showed not only the naked hostility of many members to European institutions but also an depressing degree of ignorance that many members possess on elemental constitutional matters. Despite the pleas of the Attorney General that MPs focus on the problem of how to adjust the voting rights of prisoners, members instead chose to use the debate as an opportunity question the legitimacy of the European Court - shamefully dubbed a 'kangaroo court' by one MP - and in some cases to argue for withdrawal from the Council of Europe. Speaker after speaker argued that it was for Parliament to make the law, and not for unelected judges ignoring the reality that this is in fact their job under both the ECHR and the HRA. Many MPs were happy to argue that prisoners were in fact a class of second-class citizens who consequently enjoy fewer human rights. </p>

<p>However, the issue that particularly vexed most MPs during the debate was the interpretative doctrine employed by the European Court that treats the Convention as a "living instrument". MPs viewed this doctrine as little more than a conceptual ramp through which the court is illegitimately extending its jurisdiction and authority as little more than a naked act of judicial imperium. Of course anyone with familiar with human rights law would know what arrant nonsense this is. To begin with the idea is not a new one. And it did not originate in the European Court. In English law it finds its most eloquent exposition in the advice of the Privy Council in Edwards v. The Attorney General of Canada  [1929] UKPC 86. At issue in Edwards was the question of whether 'persons' who might be summoned by the Governor-General to the Senate included women. Before Edwards' Case the Canadian constitution had been interpreted as applying to men only. Lord Sankey LC famously disagreed and interpreted "persons" as including women: "The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits ... The object of the Act was to grant a Constitution to Canada ... Like all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention ... Their Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this Board - it is certainly not their desire - to cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal interpretation." The interpretative process employed by the European Court is identical. The provisions of the ECHR are to be interpreted generously, not only in light of contemporary society but also with reference in the penal context to developments and commonly accepted standards in the other contracting states of the Council of Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant Overseas Experience</strong><br />
One fortunate legacy of the United Kingdom's colonial past is the proliferation of the Westminster constitutions throughout the Commonwealth. Just as the US states are laboratories of democracy, so too is this family of nations. And yet at no point did the House of Commons consider the experiences of Canada, Israel, South Africa or Australia.  In Australia, for example, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth) was amended in 2006 by the insertion of Section 93(8AA) which prohibited all prisoners from voting in any Senate or House of Representatives election. This ban was challenged before the High court, which in Roach v Electoral Commissioner [2007] HCA 43 declared the ban to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. Within the Council of Europe Ireland whose electoral law was effectively the same as British law being a statute that dated from before 1922 and independence expunged the self same provisions from the statute book in 2006 (Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006). Similarly, Cyprus passed the Electoral Law Amendment in 2006 to give effect to the Hirst judgment. Yet in the home of the Mother of Parliaments legislators are now so parochial that they are either unwilling or unable to exam these solutions and experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Consequences of a UK Default</strong><br />
The subsidiary nature of the ECHR means that it falls to the state to comply with the judgments of the Court. Under the ECHR contracting states agree to fully and promptly to implement the judgments of the court. However, there are no effective sanctions to deal with a state that refuses resolutely to abide by the judgment of the Court in a particular case. Under the provisions of the newly implemented Protocol 14 the Committee of Ministers can refer a defaulting state back to the Court, though this needs a majority of two thirds to do so. And other than further and embarrassing censure by the Court, the only other sanctions are a suspension of voting rights in the Committee of Ministers and ultimately expulsion from the Council of Europe itself (Articles 7-8, Treaty of London). Both are unlikely. But in the febrile atmosphere of the debate some politicians have advocated that the UK should use the issue of prisoner voting a pretext for withdrawing from the ECHR and the Council of Europe.</p>

<p>This, however, is dangerous territory. The government is bound by the law. This includes, of course, judgments of international courts whose jurisdiction it has voluntarily accepted. In a country governed by the rule of law the other branches of government must be seen to accept and abide by decisions of the courts. A government should not brazenly defy the European Court as the UK is clearly tempted to do. This unprecedented action would not only undermine the moral and political standing of the UK, it would also undoubtedly give succour to other European nations whose human rights record is shameful. Not only do politicians have a special responsibility by virtue of their prominent position in society, they should know that their example encourages others to comply with the law. For when politicians are seen to question the law and then to defy it, a wider breakdown in justice and order at all levels will inevitably follow. </p>

<p><strong>Possible Solutions?</strong><br />
Clearly some sort of sensible solution will need to be found. The UK must change the law in order to comply with its international obligations, and to be seen to be complying with the international rule of law. To that end a draft Parliamentary bill could be prepared with a carefully tailored set of provisions that reflects the jurisprudence of the European Court. The Bill might extend the franchise to some prisoners while continuing the ban in other cases. For instance, people committed of offences under electoral laws could be disenfranchised during their incarceration, or those who commit fraud or corruption while in public office. Similarly, individuals sentenced to whole life tariffs might loose the vote on the basis there is little possibility that they will be released back into society. As a residual safeguard the trial judge could enjoy a discretion to remove the penalty where it is in the interests of justice. And so on.<br />
Given the uncertainty over just what provisions would pass muster under the ECHR further judicial elucidation would be very useful. Thus the draft bill could be referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC - in effect the Supreme Court) under s.4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833 for an advisory opinion. Strictly speaking although the opinion of the JCPC would be simply advisor, but it would be difficult for Parliament to ignore it. Moreover, because the issue would be fully argued and tested before enactment the resulting bill would be largely immune from challenge in the domestic courts. And, of course, if the issue comes before the European Court again, that court would have the benefit of the opinion, in effect, of the UK Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Equally, it is open to the UK government to propose that the text of the Convention is amended so that states would be explicitly able to impose restrictions. Since the original Convention was concluded its provisions have been supplemented and amended on numerous occasions through additional Protocols. It is open to the UK government to seek to change the text of the Convention so that the right in Article 1 of Protocol 1 could be qualified by national legislatures. Naturally this of course means delicate and protracted negotiations with the other parties to the Convention, and there is no guarantee of success. But on the issue of prisoner disenfranchisement this is taking the proverbial sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=http://en.rsf.org/><strong>Reporters Without Borders</strong></a> seconds the <a href= /paperchase/2011/03/un-urges-turkish-government-to-respect-freedom-of-expression.php>United Nations' call on the Turkish government</a> to "<a href=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37766&Cr=journalist&Cr1=>guarantee freedom of opinion and expression</a>," as the imprisonment and punishment of journalists on charges of challenging and acting to 'overthrow government via conspiracy' are ridiculous and unacceptable. In accordance with the UN, Reporters Without Borders believes it is inherent that Turkey comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in ensuring that Turkish journalists are innocent until proven guilty, and that their 'crimes' -- should there be any -- are legitimate and not politically motivated to satisfy the needs and desires of authorities who seek to keep them silent. </p>

                <p>Reporters Without Borders condemns the March 3rd arrest of two Turkish journalists charged for belonging to an alleged "terrorist" conspiracy known as "Ergenekon," Ahmet Sik (writer for Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and Bianet newspapers and author of several books about the "Ergenekon" case) and Nedim Sener (reporter for the liberal daily Milliyet). Seven journalists of <a href=http://en.rsf.org/turkey-three-online-journalists-jailed-in-18-02-2011,39590.html><em>OdaTV</em></a> have been arrested in the same case. Most recently, on March 25th, the <a href= http://en.rsf.org/turquie-seizure-and-destruction-of-ahmet-25-03-2011,39890.html>last unpublished draft copies of a book</a> -- which explores the relationship between the police and the influential Islamic "Gülen Movement" -- by Sik were seized and destroyed by authorities. </p>

                <p>Since then, <a href= http://en.rsf.org/turquie-courts-refuse-to-back-down-so-17-03-2011,39820.html>thousands have been demonstrating every weekend in Istanbul,</a> in response to a call from the Freedom for Journalists Platform (GÖP). Reporters Without Borders supports each and every one of these protesters and will continue in the fight to bring justice to Turkish journalists. This latest crackdown, unanimously condemned as targeting two of the most prominent Turkish investigative journalists with charges that are still "secret," has clearly exposed the limits of the "democratic progress" achieved over the past few years.</p>

                <p>This is not the first time Turkey has shined amid the spot light of press freedom violations. The twenty-year <a href= http://en.rsf.org/turkey-anti-terrorism-law-used-repeatedly-22-11-2010,38864.html>Anti-Terrorism Law</a> has been repeatedly used to muzzle journalists raising "taboo" issues such as Turkey's national minorities, abuses from the police, justice or the military, or the "Ergenekon" case. For instance, anyone taking an interview from a PKK member, even to criticise it, faces prison for "making propaganda on behalf of a terrorist organisation." An example of this is the case of Radikal journalist Ertugrul Mavioglu, whose trial is to start this week. Despite amendments that led to a dramatic fall in the number of sentences, the very existence of Article 301 of the Criminal Code, which punishes "insults to the Turkish nation and the Turkish Republic," constitutes a clear intensive to self-censorship. As recently as March 28th, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk was condemned in appeal to pay a 6,000 TL fine for mentioning the massive killings of Kurds and Armenians perpetrated in the early 20th century. The Turkish Law 5651 on the Internet provides for the widespread mass blocking of websites, including on such grounds as "offence to (Mustafa Kemal) Atatürk." As a result, <a href =http://en.rsf.org/turkey-youtube-completes-a-year-of-being-05-05-2009,32964.html>YouTube</a> was blocked in May 2008, myspace.com in September 2009, Vimeo in September 2010 and Google-owned Blogger platform in March 2011. </p>

                <p>Because of repressive instances such as these, Reporters Without Borders classifies Turkey as a 2010 country under surveillance for online freedom of expression, and the country is ranked 138/178 on the 2010 <a href=http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html>Press Freedom Index.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>AZERBAIJAN: Detention of Youth Activist Highlights Failure to Provide Alternative to Military Service</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sarah Paulsworth, University of Pittsburgh School of Law '12, writes about the absence of alternative military service in Azerbaijan and of protections afforded to conscientious objectors (COs) under international law...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<strong>The Imprisoned Activist and condition of CO's in Azerbaijan</strong><br />
<img alt="Bakhtiyar Hajiyev" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Bakhtiyar%20Hajiyev%201.jpg" width="300" height="321" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />On March 4, 2011 well-known Azerbaijani activist, former parliamentary candidate Bakhtiyar Hajiyev was arrested for evading obligatory military service and sentenced to one month of pre-trial detention. According to a handwritten <a href="http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/2329607.html">letter</a> [Azeri] he managed to have delivered to friends from his place of detention, Hajiyev was beaten, verbally abused, threatened with rape and denied medical attention in early stages of his arrest. In his letter, Hajiyev also announced he was starting a hunger-strike (which has since been called off) and implied that he may be suicidal. Hajiyev had previously asserted to law enforcement and military officials, who have been harassing him since November 2010, that he wished to exercise his right to perform alternative service, in lieu of traditional military service, consistent with Azerbaijan's Constitution. Hajiyev's continued detention highlights serious shortcomings in Azerbaijan's legislation related to its compulsory military service and COs.</p>

<p>COs are individuals who due to religious or other beliefs refuse to perform traditional military service. COs include those who object on religious grounds, like Jehovah's Witnesses, and those like Hajiyev who object for other reasons, such as pacifism. In addition to Hajiyev's case, there are a number of other recent incidents where conscientious objectors have been detained and even imprisoned in Azerbaijan. According to religious freedom watchdog <a href="http://www.forum18.org/">Forum 18</a>, on January 25 of this year Azerbaijan's Supreme Court rejected an appeal of a nine-month prison sentence for Jehovah's Witness Farid Mammedov, who was prosecuted for evading military service and is now serving his sentence in a labor camp. The Supreme Court upheld a lower courts prosecution of Mushfig Mammedov (unrelated to Farid Mammedov) in a similar case in December 2010. Mushfig Mammedov and Samir Huseynov, also prosecuted for military evasion, have filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (Application 14604/08). </p>

<p><strong>Legal situation for COs in Azerbaijan</strong><br />
<img alt="Military Parade" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Military%20Parade.jpg" width="300" height="205" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />In Azerbaijan, all male citizens of between the ages of 18-35 must serve between one and one-and-a-half years of military service unless they are deemed physically or mentally unfit for service. However, according to Article 76(II) of <a href="http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_a.pdf">Azerbaijan's Constitution</a> [PDF, Azeri], "If beliefs of citizens come into conflict with service in the army then in some cases envisaged by legislation alternative service instead of regular army service is permitted." Parallel with this, freedom of conscience for everyone is guaranteed under Article 48 of the Constitution. Those accused of evading military service in Azerbaijan are prosecuted under Article 321 of <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1658/file/4b3ff87c005675cfd74058077132.htm/preview">Azerbaijan's Criminal Code,</a> which provides for up to a two-year prison term in peacetime for evasion and a three to six-year prison term when the nation is at war.</p>

<p>Prior to 2002, the Constitutional provision on alternative service was not present; however, Azerbaijan added it consistent with the conditions of its accession into the Council of Europe (COE). Specifically, the Republic of Azerbaijan undertook the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?Link=/documents/adoptedtext/ta00/eopi222.htm">obligation</a> [PACE opinion 222] before the COE to adopt legislation on alternative service and pardon all COs. Although Azerbaijan did alter its Constitution, more definite steps to clarify who qualifies for alternative military service, under what circumstances, and what alternative service entails have not been forthcoming. Azerbaijan's l<a href="http://militarycourt.gov.az/ru/index.php?menu=36">aw on military service</a> ["Hərbi Xidmət Haqqında" Azərbaycan Respublikasinin Qanunu, in Azeri] contains no provisions on alternative service, nor is alternative service envisaged in separate legislation. In the interim, the prosecution and persecution of COs, including Hajiyev, has persisted, leaving Azerbaijan in breach of its obligations before the COE and also the broader international community for a decade.  </p>

<p><strong>International Standards</strong><br />
Azerbaijan's prosecution of COs contravenes the right to freedom of conscience, which is enshrined in a number of international human rights instruments that Azerbaijan has ratified, including Article 18 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) and Article 18 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/pdf/ccpr.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR). In the past, some legal experts looked to ICCPR Article 8 and concluded that obligatory military service for COs was lawful, since Article 8 prohibits forced labor but not in the context of "[a]ny service of a military character and, in countries where conscientious objection is recognized, any national service required by law of conscientious objectors." However, in considering the cases of two COs from South Korea (<a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/26a8e9722d0cdadac1257279004c1b4e?Opendocument">CCPR/C/88/D/1321-1322/2004</a>) the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) said Article 8 "neither recognizes nor excludes a right of conscientious objection." It therefore decided, based on ICCPR Article 18, that the conviction and sentencing of a CO "amounts to a restriction on their ability to manifest their religion or belief." Furthermore, in <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument">UN Human Rights Commission Resolution 1998/77</a> the UNHRC reminded States with obligatory military service to set up a system of alternative service for COs that is "of a non-combat or civilian character, in the public interest and not of a punitive nature." On the basis of these human rights instruments, and UN decisions and resolutions, the continued prosecution and persecution of Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, and other people like him, who seek to perform alternative service in lieu of traditional military service, is clearly a breach of Azerbaijan's obligation before the international community to ensure freedom of conscience. </p>

<p>Azerbaijan's prosecution of COs also contravenes Article 9 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR), which encompasses the right to freedom of conscience. As member of the COE, Azerbaijan has a positive obligation to respect and uphold the rights envisaged in the ECHR. Furthermore, the COE requires new member-states with obligatory military service, including Azerbaijan, to implement legislation allowing for alternative service for COs. Azerbaijan unequivocally undertook this obligation during its accession. In addition, pursuant to <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta01/EREC1518.htm">PACE Recommendation 1518</a>, the Assembly sought to have the Committee of Ministers compel other (older) COE members to adopt legislation allowing conscientious objectors to be exempt from compulsory military service and put in place a system of alternative service. </p>

<p><strong>Europe's Problematic Jurisprudence</strong><br />
Interestingly, despite the protection afforded to COs in both international and European human rights instruments, the ECtHR and its now defunct gatekeeper, the European Commission on Human Rights, have been less than clear on the issue of rights afforded to COs. This has seriously undermined the full realization of freedom of conscience for COs in COE member states, including in Azerbaijan for Bakhtiyar Hajiyev. </p>

<p>In <em><a href="http://strasbourgconsortium.org/document.php?DocumentID=4538">Grandrath v. Germany</a></em> (1966) [French] and <em>X v. Austria</em> (1973) [See generally <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/2053881B-5606-42C4-977E-120AF07B8C73/0/FICHES_Objection_de_conscience_EN.pdf">ECtHR fact sheet</a> on COs], the European Commission on Human Rights found that states were free to determine whether COs are exempt from military service. Then, in <em><a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=Turkey%20%7C%20%DClke&amp;sessionid=67762560&amp;skin=hudoc-en">Uelke v. Turkey</a></em>, the ECtHR considered the case of a CO under the ECHR Article 3 prohibition against torture and found a violation in light of the aggregate effects of numerous imprisonments and the fact that the petitioner was not exempt from military service even after serving his prison sentence. The ECtHR, however, refrained from making a decision with regards to Article 9, and the case therefore seems to have limited applicability (if any) on cases like the situation of Hajiyev, where the petitioner has not yet been subjected to numerous arrests but is being punished for his beliefs.  </p>

<p>This jurisprudence is disturbing, but the ECtHR stands poised to change this trend in <em>Bayatyan v. Armenia</em>, a case the Grand Chamber will soon decide. In October 2009, the ECtHR issued a chamber decision in <em><a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=Armenia%20%7C%20Bayatyan&amp;sessionid=67762579&amp;skin=hudoc-en">Bayatyan</a></em>, a CO case that the Court has finally considered under Article 9. However, the Chamber decision was surprising, to say the least. In this decision, the ECtHR said that Article 9 "clearly left the choice of recognizing conscientious objectors to each contracting party." It added, "[A]rticle 9, read in light of Article 4 Section 3(b) [prohibition against forced labor outside the context of compulsory military service] does not guarantee a right to refuse military service on conscientious grounds." This decision has been widely criticized and appears to be in direct conflict with UN obligations, the ECHR, and principals that the COE itself has promulgated and imposed on its member-states. </p>

<p>In May 2010 the ECtHR's Grand Chamber accepted a referral of the case, so the Bayatyan decision is not yet final. According to the dissenting opinion of Judge Ann Power, the ECtHR failed to interpret the Convention as a "living instrument." In this sense, even if Article 9 and 4 Section 3(b) were once read as allowing states to not exempt COs from compulsory military service, this understanding could be reinterpreted in light of recent UN and COE activity and in a manner consistent with current standards. Additionally, consistent with the concurring opinion of Judge Elisabet Fura, the case could be assessed within the framework of the statements made by Armenia during COE accession in accordance with the International Court of Justice's <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/59/6159.pdf">Nuclear Tests Case</a> [PDF]. Pursuant to this case, legally-binding obligations can arise from statements made by government officials. During its accession process to the COE, Armenia made statements clearly committing itself to instituting a system of alternative service, and under international law those statements "may have the effect of creating legal obligations." Similarly, Azerbaijan may be deemed to have incurred legal obligations through statements it made during the accession process. This could be relevant to Hajiyev's case, because Azerbaijan has to date not adopted legislation on alternative service. In contrast, Armenia instituted this legislation in 2003, after litigation on Bayatyan was already underway. Finally, another important consideration in the Grand Chamber's forthcoming decision on Bayatyan will be the documents that it deems relevant. In the Chamber decision of October 2009, the ECtHR excluded the ICCPR, by which Armenia is bound, but included the European Union (EU) Charter on Fundamental Rights, by which Armenia is not bound as it is not a member of the EU.  Additionally, the ECtHR could include <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/hrcom22.htm">General Comment 22</a> of the Human Rights Committee on ICCPR Article 18, UN Human Rights Commission Resolution 1998/77 and CCPR/C/88/D/1321-1322/2004. In General Comment 22, the UNHRC says, "The Covenant does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection, but the Committee believes that such a right can be derived from Article 18, inasmuch as the obligation to use lethal force may seriously conflict with the freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one's religion or belief."</p>

<p><img alt="Bakhtiyar Hajiyev2" src="http://jurist.org/dateline/Bakhtiyar%20Hajiyev%202.jpg" width="300" height="162" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 4px 10px 10px 4px;" />Due to the dissonance between the international standards and ECtHR jurisprudence on COs, the ECtHR's decision on Bayatyan could have serious implications for member-states like Azerbaijan who are bound by the ECHR but continue to persecute COs. The Grand Chamber should diverge from the Chamber decision, and embrace the internationally accepted view that an exemption from traditional military service for COs is envisaged in the Right to Freedom of Conscience. However, even if it does not rule in this manner, the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee on the South Korea case and the COE's mandate that member states should provide alternative service options to COs should be the guiding principal for any litigation that could proceed from Bakhtiyar Hajiyev's detention and prosecution.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br />
<ol><br />
<li>In the future, Azerbaijan must work to ensure that, consistent with obligations it has undertaken before the international community, alternative service is available to COs. It should adopt and implement legislation on alternative service as soon as possible and, in the meanwhile, cease the prosecution, persecution and detention of COs. </li><br />
<li>In parallel, the international community needs to encourage Azerbaijan to fulfill its international obligations with respect to COs. The Grand Chamber needs to ensure that its decision in Bayatyan is consistent with international standards, which clearly envisage protection for COs from compulsory traditional military service. </li><br />
<li>Finally, intervention is needed to ensure the safety of all COs in detention in Azerbaijan, especially Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, who has already been subjected to mistreatment and expressed that his physical and mental wellbeing are in jeopardy.  </li><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Lt. Col. Stephen Abraham (US Army, ret.), formerly assigned to the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, says that the Executive Order for the Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station is illusory in that it creates an unnecessary process that does not address the fundamental question of whether a person held at Guantanamo has been lawfully detained....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/stephenabraham.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0"vspace="2"></td><td><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n March 7, 2011, the President signed the Executive Order for the Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. While others will presume to weigh the political aspects of the Order, it is with the legal aspects - more fundamentally, the nature of the power exercised - with which I take particular exception.</p>

<p>The Order makes clear that it does not create a source for detention authority nor does it affect the scope of existing authority. (Section 1(b)). Though seemingly relegated to nearly the end of the Order, perhaps an afterthought, the Order concedes that "the process established under this order does not address the legality of any detainee's law of war detention." (Section 8). Giving due regard to the explicitly excluded aspects of detention, the discussion within the Order of the premise for detention (the necessity to protect against a significant threat to the security of the United States (Section 2)) is gratuitous if not outright misleading.</p>

<p>The Order has absolutely nothing to do with the legitimacy of indefinite detention. Instead, it is a self-indulgent exercise by which the Chief Executive, purporting to rely on such authority as the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, has declared his office to be the sole arbiter of how the nature of rights - no longer fundamental - are to be defined. With respect to that latter point, it is interesting to note that the Order reinserts an argument seemingly abandoned by the Administration for nearly two years, that the power to detain is to be found in the Constitution, specifically Article II, and not solely the AUMF. In that regard, the Order seems to do absolutely<br />
nothing to clarify the questions regarding the source and contours of powers to detain individuals, potentially indefinitely.</p>

<p>Instead, the Order speaks to yet another process for reviewing the continued detention of individuals held at Guantanamo, some now for nearly a decade. However, the Order is less about creating yet another administrative review process and more a pronouncement that what we might regard as the most fundamental of human rights - our liberty interest - is an indulgence, an exercise of Executive largesse upon which all other rights depend.</p>

<p>This conclusion is founded in Section 1(b) of the Order, language that speaks succinctly and chillingly to the power to detain indefinitely. However, it is not with the possibility of indefinite detention with which issue is taken but, rather, that the exercise of this power is ultimately subject to the discretion - the whim - of just one person. The Order emphasizes both the fact that the detention itself is discretionary and, as well, the process of review. Coupled with the stated grounds for detention and what emerges is a chilling view of the fine line between freedom and captivity.</p>

<p>In the criminal law context, prosecutorial discretion - the power to choose whether to bring criminal charges - has created a tension between the three branches of government that ultimately seeks to find a point of balance between the interests of the individual accused and society. Criminal laws are passed based on societal imperatives and not to target a specific wrongful past act; <em>ex post facto</em> laws are expressly forbidden by the Constitution. Judges arguably take a secondary role as prosecutors decide what laws to prosecute and the individuals against which to proceed, leaving largely to defense attorneys the responsibility for challenging the facts. As a result, the executive branch plays a prominent, if not dominant, role in the legal process. However, this exercise is not without limits. Though assiduously avoiding any hint of advocacy, judges serve the critical role of ensuring that the legal process comports with Constitutional due process.</p>

<p>Sadly, the process described within the Order has everything to do with prosecutorial discretion but without critical safeguards. More odious is the fact that the Order at once presumes the simultaneous and exclusive authority of the Executive Branch to decree law, dictate the manner of exercise, and decree the law's constitutionality, both in its<br />
expression and in its execution.</p>

<p>The Order creates another review process but one not targeted to the underlying validity of the detention. Rather, that detention is presumptively valid, subjecting the detainee only to a tri-annual inquiry of whether continued detention is consistent with security interests. Even were a specific detention is determined not to be justified on national security grounds specified under the Order, there is no legal obligation to effectuate the release of the person detained. In fact, provisions of the Order such as Section 5(1) speak to situations in which a person "whose continued detention has been determined not to be warranted," - as if to conspicuously avoid any possible suggestion of innocence or wrongful detention - could be held for eighteen months before the failure to effectuate his release is subject to review.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Order is an illusion. It creates an unnecessary process that does not address the fundamental question of whether a person held at Guantanamo has been lawfully detained. It will not distinguish between a person detained without evidence of wrongful conduct and one as against whom criminal charges are warranted.</p>

<p>Instead, the Order is merely another mechanism for the creation of a process, one not subject to meaningful scrutiny by an independent decision maker, through which continued - if not permanent - detention is all but assured.</p>

<p>If the last decade has proven anything, it is that our system of justice that has endured for more than 200 years is not a process that may be disregarded as a matter of expedience. There is to be found nowhere in our Constitution or the moral principles by which we have empowered and guided our democratic institutions such unilaterally decreed and specifically applied exceptions to due process and liberty interests. Guantanamo as a detention facility has been rendered legally irrelevant. But Guantanamo is not an adequate substitute for a judicial process that respects our laws and acknowledges the essential character of fundamental human rights; it is unacceptable, irresponsible, and ultimately unlawful. In that regard, the most recently issued Executive Order is an ill attempt to give cover to a process - indefinite detention without charge - that has rightly drawn opposition by so many, including a bipartisan group of over 140 prominent</p>

<p>Americans with which I have proudly added my voice.</p>

<blockquote>"When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it
means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.'

<p>'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you can make words mean so many<br />
different things.'</p>

<p>'The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which is to be master -- that's<br />
all."</blockquote></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=amos-guiora">Amos N. Guiora</a> of the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah says that new guidelines regarding questioning terrorism suspects undermine fundamental constitutional protections...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Guiora.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he Obama Administration just issued new guidelines to allow more extended questioning of terrorism suspects - before giving <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  Individuals suspected of domestic terrorism will thus be held for a longer time period than regular criminal suspects, because their alleged crime fits in the magic category of terrorism. At base, these new rules undermine one of the most fundamental constitutional protections of individual rights - the <em>Miranda</em> warning.</p>

<p>The 1966 case of <em>Miranda v Arizona</em> is arguably the seminal case in the constitutional criminal procedure revolution of the Warren Court. Millions of "Law and Order" viewers can recite the <em>Miranda</em> warnings in their sleep: "you have the right to remain silent; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law; and you have the right to an attorney and one will be provided to you if you cannot afford one."<br />
   <br />
In 1984, the Supreme Court in <em>Quarles v New York </em>recognized a public safety exception to Miranda. In cases of a threat to public safety, police officers can question suspects before issuing <em>Miranda</em> warnings in order to respond to that public safety threat.   Individual rights and state security - the <em>Miranda</em> warnings and the public safety exception protect the first and recognize the needs of the second.</p>

<p>Fair enough and good enough?  Not according to the Obama Administration.</p>

<p>The failed attempted bombings of Northwest Airlines #256, the so-called underwear bomber, and in New York's Times Square offered the first hints of a sea change in the law. In both cases, Attorney General Holder suggested <em>Quarles</em> does not go far enough. In other words, he argued for a significant expansion of the public safety exception. Although the Attorney General is the nation's chief law enforcement officer, his argument was political, not pragmatic.  This is critical because law enforcement was not the impetus.  Quite the opposite; the push came from the Administration. That is, our first responders, those on the front line of operational counterterrorism, who are first on the scene, had no complaints about their ability to enforce the law and protect the state and the public within the framework of the public safety exception.</p>

<p>It may seem like good politics, but denying <em>Miranda</em> protections to suspected terrorists shows a disturbing willingness to minimize rights for a loosely defined category of individuals in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack. Expanding the already established public safety exception to <em>Miranda </em>is fraught with danger. My skepticism draws strength from law enforcement officials who neither advocated nor requested such a measure. That tells me the existing standard is sufficient for lawful and effective domestic counterterrorism. Any expansion beyond that is both unwarranted and dangerous.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, American history is replete with examples of the high-price, innocent individuals have paid for executive branch excess, aided by an acquiescent Congress and a docile Supreme Court. This past highlights the extraordinary dangers inherent in an unwarranted expansion of executive power and the dangers of creating exceptions in the face of a threat, whether real or imagined. The timeless words of the poet and philosopher George Santayana, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it," should be our most poignant guide.  Here, it is critical to remember the purpose of <em>Miranda</em>. </p>

<p>There is little doubt that terrorism poses extraordinary dangers. The past decade has been marked by attack after attack against innocent people worldwide, unjustifiably and criminally defined as "legitimate targets" by terrorists.   Even in the face of this conduct, the core principles of both <em>Miranda</em> and <em>Quarles</em> are clear, and maintain their importance, with respect to terrorism.</p>

<p>In providing greater protections to individuals subject to police interrogation, Chief Justice Warren clearly looked back into the dark pages of interrogations in the U.S.  Extraordinarily clear and powerful, his words remind us of the values endangered by denying<em> Miranda </em>protections to suspected terrorists.  They remind us of the extraordinary, and unforgivable, price paid by untold numbers of people historically subjected to methods ranging from the third degree to the unconscionable. Chief Justice Warren's words were a clarion call to state agents that the rule of law demands protection for suspects, no matter what the alleged crime or who they are.</p>

<p>The criminal procedure revolution does not limit law enforcement's ability to detain for either interrogation or on the scene crime prevention. The criminal procedure revolution does impose on law enforcement the obligation to inform the suspect of the right to representation by counsel during interrogation and the right to remain silent. As the language of <em>Miranda</em> makes abundantly clear, creating, and protecting, both rights is essential.</p>

<p>Effective counterterrorism neither demands, nor warrants, broader exceptions to the balance between the needs of law enforcement and the rights of individuals.  Expanding the public safety exception beyond <em>Quarles</em> unnecessarily chips away at <em>Miranda</em> and undoes this vital balance.  While politics is understandable, an unwarranted exception is just that - unwarranted.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Michael Mintz of <a href="http://mymedialabs.com/">My Media Labs</a> says that while it makes perfect sense that copyright owners have been resorting to Twitter take-down notices in order to curb infringement, where secondary liability has been once removed infringement may no longer be an issue....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Mintz.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>C</b></font>an a tweet violate someone's copyright?  Apparently some copyright owners think so.  According to an article on Yahoo Finance, Twitter received 300 take-down notices from copyright owners in November 2010, alleging that users had posted links to pirated copies of their work. Twitter responded by removing the allegedly infringing tweets and reserved the right to suspend the account of those who sent the offending tweets. The take-down notices and Twitter's response have raised some legal questions; most notably, what makes posting a link to infringing materials infringement itself? </p>

<p>Courts have not yet given a definitive standard for whether the posting of links to pirated materials constitutes infringement, but <a href="http://support.twitter.com/entries/15795">Twitter is very clear on this</a> in their Copyright and DMCA policy:</p>

<blockquote>We respond to valid claims of alleged copyright infringement such as the unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as an account background or account avatar, or Tweets containing a link to allegedly infringing materials.</blockquote>

<p>Twitter also has points on its <a href="http://support.twitter.com/groups/33-report-a-violation/topics/121-guidelines-best-practices/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules">Rules</a> page warning users that it will respond to "clear and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement," and that users may not use the site for "any unlawful purposes or for promotion of illegal activities." The site's <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">Terms of Service</a> goes even further, stating:</p>

<blockquote>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, Twitter will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</blockquote>

<p>The Terms of Service that every user agrees to when they sign up for an account grant Twitter broad power to take down tweets and shut down user accounts even if infringement has not been proven. But from a purely legal perspective, is Twitter right to take down first and ask questions later? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/search.cgi?search=twitter">Chilling Effects</a> is an online clearinghouse run jointly by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other institutions. They started collecting the take down notices on their site at the end of November. Wendy Seltzer, founder of Chilling Effects, said:</p>

<blockquote>"It's interesting that they [Twitter] are receiving takedowns, given that most of what they're hosting is little 140-character bursts of expression ... Copyright holders are pushing the complaint out further, not going after the user who hosted, or even the user who pointed, but going after Twitter because it's made itself a central location for the collection of information."</blockquote>

Why aren't copyright owners going after the infringers themselves?  Lawyers <a href="http://community.martindale.com/legal-groups/Lawyer_Tech_2/social_media_for_lawyers/b/social_media_for_lawyers-blog/archive/2011/01/03/140-characters-do-not-equal-fair-use-copyright-owners-target-twitter.aspx#comments">addressed this question</a> in a discussion recently on Martindale.com Connected.  </p>

<p>Jason Romrell, General Counsel for insuranceLeads.com said: <br />
<blockquote>"I've found it easier to direct my "requests" to Twitter than to go after the infringer." He says that when you go to Twitter they "resolve the issue in a matter of days." Pursuing infringers, who can be spread out across jurisdictions, hard to pinpoint, and potentially damage-proof (AKA poor) just doesn't make sense "when a letter to Twitter will work just fine."</blockquote></p>

<p>The typical scenario justifying the take-down notice involves a user who intentionally posts links to pirated movies and music, while encouraging other to consume this content. It is possible, however, that a tweet contains significant, original expression and incidentally used a link to infringing material to emphasize its point. With services like <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/deckly">Deck.ly</a>, users can now write longer posts via Twitter where 140 characters are displayed in the tweet itself, and then a link is provided to read the rest of the update on either the 3rd party client reader TweetDeck or via browser (a dedicated Home Page and site is in the works). There are a few implications to this twist in tweeting:</p>

<blockquote>1.	Links to infringing works now may be buried in Deck.ly past the 140 character tweet that shows up on the Twitter website, making it harder for copyright owners to monitor and pinpoint such links.
2.	Users expression via Deck.ly has the potential to be even more significant than a link to an allegedly infringing work, and issuing a take down without any opportunity for the user to respond or defend their "super-tweet" begins to look more like limiting free expression than defending copyright.
3.	An entire line of Fair Use defenses may be available for users who can establish that a link is like a quote, and that copyright owners should have targeted the source of the infringement (namely the original infringer on the target destination) rather than the poster of a link, which was secondary to the free expression in a Deck.ly post.</blockquote>

<p>With or without Deck.ly, there is still potential for cases of innocent infringement. Shelley Dunstone, Principal at Legal Circles, a consultancy service for the legal profession, said:</p>

<blockquote>"I can see how you could easily make a mistake by tweeting links to other people's articles - although this is a common use of Twitter, and most people would be happy to have their article referenced in this way.  I blogged a link to an article and the authors were very upset because their web site required people to sign up with their contact details before receiving it.  I changed the link to take the user to the sign-up form."</blockquote>

<p>Shelley's case brings up a relevant point in deciding whether copyright owners can go a step beyond the take-down notice, and directly sue the tweeter: intent.</p>

<p>There is potential for liability under the doctrine of contributory infringement when the defendant intentionally links to known, infringing material. The Copyright Act does not expressly hold that anyone can be liable for the infringing activity of another party <em>Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios</em>, but courts have developed common law doctrines to extend secondary liability as we have seen in <em>MGM v. Grokster</em> and more recently the Limewire case.  In both of these cases, however, the copyright holders sued the services making infringement possible through their P2P technologies. This would be more analogous in the current situations to a copyright owner going after the destination site of the link, rather than dealing with Twitter or the linking user, for whom secondary liability may exist.</p>

<p>As for services providing platforms for infringing activities, YouTube recently evaded a billion dollar lawsuit brought against it by Viacom who claimed that users uploaded infringing content that the defendant knew about.  The court granted summary judgment in favor of YouTube based on safe harbor provisions in the DMCA.  According to martindale.com Connected member and lawyer Evan Brown, the DMCA requires "non-knowledge" by the defendant of specific infringing material on the network.  He wrote: </p>

<blockquote>"The major issue in the case was whether YouTube met these conditions of "non-knowledge" (that's my term, not the court's) so that it could be in the DMCA safe harbor. Viacom argued that the infringement was so pervasive on YouTube that the site should have been aware of the infringement and thus not in the safe harbor. YouTube of course argued otherwise."</blockquote>

<p>Does the DMCA take the teeth out of secondary liability?  If a site like YouTube falls under safe harbor provisions of the DMCA even though they know that some users are uploading infringing content, how can it be concluded that a user sharing a link to content on a third-party site has infringed the copyright holders' work in significant enough way to warrant removing the tweet? Under the logic employed in YouTube, such users would not fall under secondary liability, or in this case could possibly be tertiary liability (user A uploads infringing content to site 1, and then user B broadcasts a link to user A's content on site 2). </p>

<p>Coming back to the ease that a take-down notice to Twitter entails, it makes perfect sense that copyright owners are resorting to it, but when someone is providing a link to a third-party site, where secondary liability has been once removed, does the original tweet really constitute infringement?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Luke Milligan of the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law says the debate over warrantless GPS surveillance has been distracted by form and hyperbole, and that because this constitutional question is open, judges will take a pragmatic approach...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Luke_Milligan.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>F</b></font>or years the public has debated the Fourth Amendment implications of warrantless GPS surveillance.  Yet hardly an episode of discourse on the subject has passed without the audience being prodded, from the right, by formalism, and, from the left, by hyperbole.  Formalistic moves in the GPS debate have generally hinged on canons of constitutional interpretation (originalism) and lines of Supreme Court precedent (<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=460&invol=276">United States v. Knotts</a>).  Hyperbole, for its part, emerges in noisy predictions of totalitarianism and gratuitous footnotes to George Orwell's <em>1984</em>.</p>

<p>Form and hyperbole are, of course, different types of devices (one distinction, among many, is that the first seeks to constrain the passions while the second to stoke them).  The devices nonetheless share the common objective to distract listeners from <em>pragmatic</em> inquiry.  A pragmatic discourse, in my mind, strives for three things: the examination of conventional wisdom, the sorting of the useless from the useful, and the reformation of conventional wisdom through the effective communication of findings.  Formalism and hyperbole, actively conflating the useless and useful, serve as drags on pragmatic inquiry.         </p>

<p>So let us resist the calls of form and hyperbole as we study the particular issue at hand: the constitutionality of warrantless GPS surveillance (or, more precisely, whether government GPS surveillance is a "search" pursuant to the Fourth Amendment).  A pragmatic analysis of this issue turns on two straightforward questions: (1) What are the societal costs of warrantless GPS surveillance programs?; and (2) Are these costs outweighed by the societal benefits of such programs?</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that only a subset of government GPS surveillance is at issue in this debate.  No matter the outcome, lawful channels for GPS surveillance will remain available to police.  After all, law enforcement will continue to be able to obtain warrants for GPS surveillance based on probable cause. Moreover, police will be able to bypass a warrant requirement whenever "exigent circumstances" arise.  A pragmatic analysis of warrantless GPS surveillance (and, more specifically, its concomitant review of costs and benefits) must be therefore confined to those situations where police (1) lack probable cause; or (2) have probable cause but lack an exigency or a warrant. </p>

<p>We begin our pragmatic inquiry with an assessment of costs.  While individual value-schemes of course differ across any population, it is undeniable that the vast majority of Americans share a deep commitment to certain "foundational" values like democracy, human dignity, autonomy, and open markets.  Many of these foundational values, it seems clear, would be weakened by programs of warrantless GPS surveillance.  As <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ny-court-of-appeals/1140764.html">recently illustrated by the New York Court of Appeals</a>, such programs permit government officials to arbitrarily track and record "trips to the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and on and on."  This type of surveillance, the Court observed, reveals not only "where we go, but by easy reference our associations-political, religious, amicable and amorous."  </p>

<p>The imposition of a warrant requirement will not by any means <em>immunize</em> our foundational values from GPS technologies.  GPS surveillance with a warrant or exigency will still track, for instance, stays at by-the-hour motels.  But this claim is beside the point.  Remember that the pragmatist cares not about immunity but rather the <em>marginal preservation</em> assured by a warrant requirement.  And warrants, as it turns out, do much to preserve our foundational values.  Warrants matter because they require police to reflect, before a particular instance of surveillance, on how any articulated need for such surveillance will be eventually assessed by an external actor (a judge).  In effect, warrants cast (if only temporarily) police officers in the role of a neutral arbiter.  Programs of warrantless GPS surveillance, to the contrary, permit police (at least when it comes to GPS) to remain comfortably in the role of law enforcer.  This invariably leads to more extensive GPS surveillance, and, in the end, a far greater erosion of our shared value-scheme.  Of course some will no doubt respond that this weakening could be otherwise avoided by <em>legislation</em> regulating GPS.  To this I would add that such weakening could be equally avoided if law enforcement voluntarily elected to not use GPS, or, for that matter, if GPS technology were impaired by a world war or economic depression.  But why would a pragmatist, facing this constitutional question at a time where judicial regulation of GPS poses no serious threat to the perception of a constrained judiciary (see discussion below), simply abstain and hope for the best?  </p>

<p>The second and final leg of our pragmatic inquiry relates to the societal benefits of warrantless GPS surveillance.  Our analysis of benefits, like costs, is limited to that subset of GPS surveillance where there is (1) no probable cause or (2) probable cause but no exigency or warrant.  How will GPS surveillance during these limited periods affect our crime rate, our crime detection rate, our apprehension rate, and the amount of government resources consumed by law enforcement (as relatively inexpensive GPS technology will surely present itself as an attractive substitute to human labor)?  While neither I nor anyone else can give definitive answers to these questions, my sense is that the gains from warrantless GPS surveillance will be quite small.  Visual surveillance, for instance, provides a decent substitute for GPS during the relatively small pre-warrant (and non-exigent) investigatory window.  Even assuming large efficiencies from warrantless GPS, I would still likely find these benefits outweighed by the expected costs of warrantless GPS surveillance.  Most of us, after all, are too risk-averse to pay for efficiency gains-even large ones-with the certain weakening of foundational values such as human dignity, autonomy, democracy, and open markets.</p>

<p>Now it is easy for me, writing as a citizen, to challenge the uses of formalism in our public discourse.  But when one is cast in the role of "judge," pragmatic analyses become necessarily more layered.  One of our prevailing narratives, after all, holds that we, the people, bestow jurists with power and political insulation; and in exchange we ask that their decision-making be constrained (either by legislatures, canons of interpretation, or "binding" judicial decisions).  Because our society values the <em>perception</em> of judicial constraint, and because such perception is strengthened by adjudicative formalism, a judge's flagrant disregard of form can be expensive for society.  The pragmatic judge must therefore incorporate the costs of being perceived as disregarding form into any instance of pragmatic adjudication.  On the other hand, the societal costs of purging hyperbole from adjudication are hardly obvious and most likely non-existent.  Thus, hyperbole should be resisted at all turns by the pragmatic jurist.</p>

<p>When it comes to the GPS issue, any societal costs ascribed to the perceived disregard of form will be <em>de minimus</em>.  After all, Supreme Court case law on this issue is, by any fair assessment, ambiguous.  On one hand, the "beeper" tracking device at issue in <em>Knotts</em> can be reasonably analogized to GPS.  But, on the other hand, the <em>Knotts</em> majority explicitly reserved the right to revisit the issue if warrantless tracking resulted in 24-hour "dragnet-type" surveillance.  The platitudes of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0389_0347_ZC1.html">Katz</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-8508.ZS.html">Kyllo</a> and, most recently, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1332.ZS.html">City of Ontario v. Quon</a> only muddy the water.  And the various canons of interpretation, for their part, can cut nearly any way on this issue.  The indeterminacy of the GPS question has been validated by the state and lower federal courts:  The 7th, 8th, and 9th Circuits, plus the supreme courts of Wisconsin and Nevada have viewed such programs as constitutional; while the D.C. Circuit and the high courts of New York, Massachusetts, and Washington have held them to be unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>All jurists are pragmatists at their core.  By this I mean that every prevailing decision, standard, doctrine, and canon of interpretation has "paid its own way" in the ruling judge's mind.  Because the constitutional question regarding warrantless GPS surveillance is unavoidably open, judges will not expect any societal costs to flow from a perceived disregard of form.  Relieved of the weight of form, jurists will dispose of this issue based on their sincere assessment of the societal costs and benefits of the underlying concrete policy: warrantless GPS surveillance.</p>

<p>Indeterminate constitutional questions like this reveal our judges' values and risk assessments.  While these revelations will be of great interest to the Court-watcher and legislator alike, nothing comes for free.  Revelations, after all, appear to only those who can see beyond form and hyperbole.</p>

		<title>Fukushima Illustrates Need for Nuclear Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist Tamar Cerafici of the Cerafici Law Firm says that the nuclear crisis in Japan highlights the need for an international response with clear, measured leadership from the United States. That leadership is hollow unless the United States adopts a coherent energy policy paying more than a begrudging acceptance of nuclear power....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/Cerafici.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he last four weeks' events at the Fuskushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant have distilled into two streams of necessary information: the first, technological and engineering response, are not reviewed in this note. Commentary and news feeds have addressed the issues admirably. The second, international legal and policy response, became important with French President Sarkozy's <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110331-french-president-sarkozy-nuclear-reform-fukushima-crisis-japan-earthquake">visit to Japan</a> just over a week ago.</p>

<p>President Sarkozy, currently the Group of 20 (G20) chairman, called for "international safety norms," and requested a meeting in May to fix new norms in the wake of the crisis. Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Sarkozy-Calls-For-Global-Nuclear-Safety-Standard-By-Years-End-118977029.html">agreed</a>. Their comments illustrate a sort of disconnect in the way nuclear safety is managed globally. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) makes safety recommendations and manages international nuclear diplomacy, but it has no enforcement power. Each country has sovereign regulations, and separate enforcement powers.  In Japan, Sarkozy asserted that such parochialism cannot support the continued global need for nuclear energy. In calling for an international review of the causes, response, and long term effects of the Fukushima crisis, Sarkozy is acknowledging that nuclear energy policy has global reach.</p>

<p>In contrast, Gregory B. Jaczko, Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) and the State Department, did no favors to anyone during the first week of the crisis when they overreacted and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/17/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-chairman-nuclear-regulatory-co">declared</a> a 50-mile exclusion, or "no-go," zone for Americans near the Dai-ichi facility. Chairman Jaczko illustrated the parochialism inherent in global energy policy, particularly in the face of Japan's exclusion zone of 12 miles. He also told Congress that there were "serious problems" cooling the reactors and that he believed workers would be exposed to potentially lethal doses of radiation. His statements, and a good dose of hyperbole from media outlets, helped trigger a run on potassium iodine tablets on the west coast. It doesn't help for the Chairman of this nation's nuclear regulatory body to yell "fire" while the President and the Secretary of Energy are urging calm. </p>

<p>We have yet to see a coordinated administration reaction to the events playing out at the Fukushima plant. The United States must produce a measured, careful response to the international issues emerging from Japan's handling of the Dai-ichi accident and subsequent cleanup. Long term, this response must include a coherent national energy policy. Currently, the United States does not have one. Instead we rely on a market-based mix of fossil fuels (69%), renewable energy (11%), and nuclear energy (20%).  This mix is the result of long term industrial reliance on cheap fossil fuel and the difficulty of financing nuclear plants with passive designs that can function under the same conditions that destroyed the Dai-ichi plant. However, as the energy needs of the country increase, a more consistent mix is necessary. </p>

<p>To highlight this critical policy need, James Conca and Judith Wright, in a <a href="http://www.progressivefix.com/getting-real-about-energy-a-balanced-portfolio-for-america%E2%80%99s-future">report</a> funded by the Progressive Policy Institute, suggest a starting point for this national energy plan: one-third fossil, one-third nuclear, and one-third renewable energy. Conca and Wright suggest we follow French, Japanese, and Korean models and make new and significant government and private investments in nuclear energy.  The United States is already the largest global consumer of nuclear energy. With 104 operating plants, use of nuclear power produces 73 percent of non-carbon electricity in the country. Lack of resources and political will have hampered any effort to scale up the use of nuclear. Even if policy makers wanted to dedicate more resources to nuclear energy development, public misconceptions about nuclear energy and the viability of renewable energy have limited the country's move to a post-carbon economy.</p>

<p>The events at the Dai-ichi plant have been a public policy nightmare here because the United States lacks a consistent energy policy that includes something more than a begrudging reliance on nuclear power.  This means the United States needs to overhaul a regulatory procedure that is rife with expensive uncertainties, develop a coherently communicated energy policy, and educate generations of users about the differences between nuclear bombs and nuclear energy. The administration should actively support President Sarkozy's call for an international analysis of nuclear safety protocols. The nuclear industry can also play a part by actively participating in the nuclear debate. Science doesn't always win an emotional debate, and the industry has for the most part kept its mouth shut and tried to let science evangelize for it. A coherent, open discussion of the situation at Dai-ichi and the status of nuclear plants in the United States would go a long way to limit the visceral reaction from much of the general public. </p>

<p>(Author's note: Readers seeking more technical information may review Murray E. Miles's excellent summary of the Fukushima accident, reported by the equally excellent Rod Adams <a href="http://atomicinsights.com/2011/04/fukushima-nuclear-accident-exceptional-summary-by-murray-e-miles.html">here</a>. It's highly readable and devoid of any pro or con rhetoric.)</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/faculty/facultymember.aspx?fac=202">Keith J. Bybee</a> of Syracuse University says that a mix of political preference and impartial principle may not only be present in our judiciary, but also may be expected by the public....<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/KeithBybee125x150.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font>lthough the lawsuits over health care reform will not reach the Supreme Court for many months, one verdict on the Affordable Care Act is already in:  the judges deciding the cases look like political partisans.</p>

<p>Two federal judges have struck down a key part of health care reform and three other federal judges have upheld the legislation. The two judges who found the reform unconstitutional were appointed by Republican presidents; the three judges who ruled in favor were appointed by the Democratic President Bill Clinton. The message seems clear. For judges - just as for politicians, pundits, and activists - views about health care appear to be a simple matter of party affiliation.</p>

<p>Given the bitter partisan debate over health care, it may not be too surprising that the arguments about reform have continued to look political now that litigation is underway. Yet the appearance of partisanship stands in sharp contrast to the image that participants in the judicial process are trying to project. The judicial rulings all dwell on issues of legal principle and are filled with careful arguments about the constitutional limits of Congress's power. Precedent, procedure, text, and the requirements of reason seem to be the only topics of discussion - and not only among the judges. As a lawyer in one of the health care cases told the New York Times, he had "not heard a single partisan remark" from his clients. "The people who brought this lawsuit," the lawyer said, "are all about the law."</p>

<p>How can such claims remain credible when judicial decisions follow an obviously political pattern? Will the partisanship of health care debate inevitably corrode public confidence in the judicial process, leaving people with the sense that the lawsuits over reform are purely a matter of politics?</p>

<p>These questions are prompted by the current litigation, but public opinion about the courts suggests that the concern is actually much broader. A new poll by Syracuse University's Campbell Public Affairs Institute, Harvard, MIT, and YouGov tells us that the public already sees a mix of political preference and impartial principle when it looks at the judiciary.</p>

<p>On one hand, the Campbell Institute Poll demonstrates that large numbers of Americans view courts as restrained institutions removed from the power-seeking motives of politics. Although a small percentage of the public thinks that conflicts end up in the courts because judges proactively attempt to involve themselves in controversies, Americans are far more likely to say that conflicts land in court either because elected officials have failed to deal with problems or because people themselves want the courts to intervene. The courts are busy because the public views them as trusted arbiters.</p>

<p>In fact, the Campbell Institute Poll indicates that the level of public trust in judges is one and a half times higher than trust in the president and five times higher than trust in members of Congress. The high level of trust in judges is coupled with a strong belief that courts are an arena where partisanship has no place. When asked whether judges should be shielded from outside pressure and allowed to make decisions on their own independent reading of the law, nearly 70% of those surveyed agreed.</p>

<p>At the same time, most people do not consider the judiciary to be a politics-free zone. The poll indicates that only a little over 7% of Americans think that the partisan background of judges has no influence at all on court decisions. Almost 45 percent of the public believes that judicial partisanship has some influence and another 42% believe that judicial partisanship has a lot of influence.</p>

<p>With an overwhelming percentage of Americans agreeing that political preference is a factor in judicial decision-making, the claim that judicial rulings are strictly a matter of legal principle is bound to be greeted with substantial skepticism. And, indeed, the Campbell Institute Poll shows that nearly 70% of those surveyed agree with the statement, "Judges always say that their decisions are based on the law and the Constitution, but in many cases judges are really basing their decisions on their own personal beliefs." When asked whether they actually believe the legal justifications that judges offer for court rulings, a large majority of Americans say no.</p>

<p>Much like the health care reform litigation, the poll raises the specter of a delegitimized court system, with beliefs about the impartiality and fairness of judges being eclipsed by suspicions of political decision-making on the bench.</p>

<p>Before raising the alarm about institutional collapse, however, it is worth noting that the poll also points toward another possibility. The fact that trust in judges persists in the teeth of widespread skepticism about judicial motivations suggests that a half-law-half-politics view of the courts may be a stable feature of public opinion.</p>

<p>People value the courts because they are ostensibly free from partisan influence. Yet people may also value judicial proceedings because they lend an air of principle and reason to the pursuit of personal interests and political attachments. Everyone wants to have a neutral and fair system of dispute resolution and everyone also wants to make sure that his or her own side prevails.</p>

<p>The result can certainly look hypocritical, with participants in the judicial process dutifully reciting the requirements of principle while appearing to exploit every opportunity to mold law to their own interests. And we may rightly criticize the unfairness of having judges who invoke law, yet seem to be deciding a case on the basis of politics. But this does not mean that the legal system faces a looming crisis. In the end, health care reform litigation may reveal less about a destructive politics of judging than about the contradictory demands we place on our courts.</p>

Obama's pledge, along with his accompanying executive orders banning torture and secret detention, heralded a return to the rule of law.</p>

<p>More than two years later, Obama's plan to close Guantanamo is in shambles.  While Obama has repatriated 67 Guantanamo prisoners, 172 remain.  Political opposition and legal hurdles now complicate further resettlement efforts.  Although the Obama administration clings to his goal of shutting the prison, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has acknowledged the prospects for closure are very, very low," and the Pentagon is pressing ahead with new military commissions at the base.  Last week, the administration formally abandoned its plan to try Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (KSM) and four other alleged 9/11 plotters in federal court, stating that they would be prosecuted in military commissions (as the Bush administration had originally planned).</p>

<p>The irony is that the United States is much further from closing Guantanamo now than it was after Obama's post-inaugural pledge. </p>

<p>Congress deserves much of the blame.  On top of previous legislation obstructing detainee resettlement, Congress has now barred the use of military funds to bring detainees to trial in the United States. This measure not only ensured the demise of the administration's plan to prosecute KSM in federal court. It also signaled the degree to which a vital tool in fighting terrorism--criminal trials--could be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.  <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2011/ag-speech-110404.html">As Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged</a> in announcing the KSM-reversal, both America's security and values are best served by federal prosecutions of suspected terrorists.</p>

<p>Obama, however, bears responsibility as well.  The administration did not lay the necessary political groundwork for the federal prosecution of KSM and his co-defendants, failing, for example, to enlist the key powerbrokers in New York, where the trial was to have taken place.</p>

<p>More generally, the president never capitalized on his post-election momentum to operationalize his promise to close Guantanamo.  Instead, he created a multi-agency task force to conduct a year-long study of detainee cases.  Without effective leadership from the White House, a fierce backlash filled the political vacuum.  Before long, the tide had turned, and what had once been a political challenge became a political impossibility.</p>

<p>The Obama administration's handling of Chinese Uighur detainees is emblematic of this larger failure. In 2008, a federal judge ordered the release of seventeen Uighur detainees after the government conceded that they presented no threat to the U.S.  Because the Uighurs could not be returned to China (where, as dissidents, they faced imprisonment and possible torture), the only remedy was release in the United States, at least until another home could be found. </p>

<p>Administration lawyers developed a plan to settle several Uighurs in northern Virginia. Resettlement would have helped demonstrate to the public that Guantanamo detainees were not all "the worst of the worst," as Bush administration officials had falsely branded them. More importantly, it would have helped persuade other countries to accept more detainees by showing America was doing its fair share to shut down the prison.  As Jane Mayer has detailed in the <em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/02/15/100215fa_fact_mayer#ixzz0hIzk4AUm">New Yorker</a></em>, Obama killed the plan after word leaked and Republicans declared their opposition to bringing any detainees to the U.S.</p>

<p>Obama's failure to close Guantanamo though is more than a matter of political missteps. It is also a consequence of his acceptance of the larger detention system that Guantanamo embodies.</p>

<p>In his May 2009 speech at the National Archives, Obama accepted several key premises of the Guantanamo system even as he repeated his pledge to close the prison itself.  To be sure, the president expressed a preference for prosecuting suspected terrorists in the regular court system.  But he also accepted that some detainees could be held indefinitely without trial while others could be charged in military commissions, a second-class justice system that lacks the constitutional safeguards and legitimacy of the federal courts.  Obama's recent executive order creating a system of periodic review for prisoners slated for indefinite detention institutionalizes this policy.</p>

<p>Obama, in short, sought only to reform Guantanamo not to end it.  Thus, rather than scrapping military commissions, the president backed legislation that propped up the commissions by making some improvements.</p>

<p>The result is not simply "Guantanamo lite," but something more corrosive. The failure to close Guantanamo has helped justify the policies of arbitrary detention and torture that spurred its creation in the first place.  Further, it has vindicated the politics of fear. "If Guantanamo is so difficult to close," Americans may wonder, "perhaps it should remain open."</p>

<p>Guantanamo was once seen as morally and legally unacceptable, and closure commanded strong bipartisan support. But today Guantanamo appears a necessary evil.  Better that Obama had never promised to close Guantanamo than to promise and to fail.</p>

<p>The question no longer is "Will Guantanamo close?"  (It won't, at least not anytime in the foreseeable future).  Rather, it is what form Guantanamo will take, and how broadly its core features of indefinite detention and military commissions will sweep.</p>

From the start, the trial has raised a lot of questions and doubts, both from people who agree with the prosecution of Wilders, as well as from those opposed.</p>

                <p>The underlying controversy started around 2007; Wilders, the leader of (now) the third largest political party in the Dutch parliament, made several statements in the press that many considered insulting or hateful. Most of the statements were directed towards Islam and the Koran, but some were also about Muslims in general. The movie "Fitna" added to the rage against Wilders. All this, however, was not ground for trying Wilders, according to the public prosecutor. Although Wilders said things about Muslims that could be seen violative of Dutch law, a politician should be able to contribute his views to relevant, public debate.</p>

                <p>By Dutch law, only the public prosecutor can bring someone to trial to enforce the penal code. So if the public prosecutor does not pursue a case, there often won't be a trial. However, if the Dutch people deeply disagree with this, they can ask the court of appeal to compel the public prosecutor to bring an individual before the court. This in fact happened around February 2009, when the court of appeal ruled that the public prosecutor had to bring Wilders to trial. </p>

                <p>A whole legal debate started, which goes too far to mention here. But at the end of the trial, Wilders did not believe that the three judges he had before him were impartial, and requested new judges twice. A panel of three judges decided on such a request; the first time it was <a href=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-rejects-bias-allegations-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php>denied</a>, the second time it was granted. This was at the end of 2010, and the result was that a new panel of judges had to completely redo the trial, which is now about to finish -- assuming, at least, the previous situation won't repeat itself. </p>

                <p>This trial raises all sorts of questions. From a legal point of view it is interesting on two levels; one of them is the question of the interplay between the freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This is most of all a discussion between Dutch and European law; Dutch law expressly prohibits the insulting of a religion, while European law frames the conduct as a violation of the freedom of religion. </p>

                <p>The second interesting question is whether a politician is within his rights to make insulting and/or hateful statements, and when doing so goes too far. By Dutch law, a politician can say or write anything inside the parliament building, where he has functional immunity. Outside the parliament building, this immunity does not exist. However, the idea of the immunity is that people in parliament have to be able to say whatever they feel is necessary for the country; it makes sense to apply this principle in "the outside world" as well, especially in the context of a very relevant public debate. </p>

                <p>Most Dutch jurists are predicting that Wilders will not be found guilty, and even the public prosecutor has admitted this from the very start. Wilders has claimed that the trial is mostly politically motivated, and this appears to be true. His ideas have captured both support and fervent opposition, including death threats made against him. </p>

                <p>About one thing, there is no doubt. Wilders will not stop what he has started. His second Fitna movie is coming out shortly, and his political party keeps expanding; the trial has only added to his party's growth. As well, Wilders is strengthened by a right-wing resurgence observable across all of Europe. Discussions involving the freedoms of speech and religion will continue to be relevant, seeing as Wilders will ensure that the two freedoms will keep colliding." </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/laurie-blank.html">Laurie Blank</a> of Emory Law School says the Goldstone "retraction" does not mitigate the report's damaging effects on the law of war.  Among the report's flaws, it ignored the element of intent for the war crime of intentionally killing civilians, and it failed to condemn Hamas' endangerment of its own civilians...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/laurieblank.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>J</b></font>ustice <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html">Goldstone's op-ed</a> in last week's Washington Post may lead some to think that the furor over the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/factfindingmission.htm">Goldstone Report</a> - and its conclusions about Israel's 2008-2009 Operation Cast Lead in Gaza - is coming to an end.  Justice Goldstone wrote that if he had known then what he knows now, the report would not have charged Israel with intentionally targeting civilians and would have recognized the validity of Israel's domestic investigations and that Hamas would not undertake any such investigations.</p>

<p>So does this "retraction" undo the bias, faulty legal analysis and unjustified conclusions that have made the Goldstone Report a lightning rod for extensive criticism?  Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Two of the Report's most damaging claims are that Israel intentionally targeted civilians and that Israel's own investigative apparatus does not meet international standards.  The op-ed piece surely takes the sting out of both of those claims and in that sense is a significant public relations victory for Israel.  But Goldstone's statement does nothing to mitigate the extraordinarily damaging effects the Report could have on the law of war, encouraging those who use civilians as a strategic tool.</p>

<p>First, the report incorrectly presumes intentionality from a lack of evidence.  The "retraction" does not undo that presumption, but simply supports a different conclusion in the face of "newly discovered" facts.  It thus leaves intact the report's flawed elimination of intent as a crucial element of the war crime of intentionally killing civilians.  </p>

<p>It may seem that stricter parameters on responsibility for civilian deaths would only increase civilian protections and therefore be a positive development.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Once intent is eliminated, it is a quick step to the faulty conclusion that any civilian death in war is a war crime.  Next, one party purposely places civilians in danger so that attacks by the other side will kill more civilians and lead to charges of war crimes, regardless of intent.  Such conduct is a horrifying exploitation of civilians for strategic benefit.</p>

<p>Second, the "retraction" does not even address - let alone reverse - how the Goldstone Report raises the specter of ever-greater danger for civilians in conflict zones.  This risk arises from the Report's failure to even discuss the legal obligations a defending party has to protect civilians and the precautions it must take accordingly.</p>

<p>After concluding that Hamas' rocket attacks on civilian areas of southern Israel were - and continue to be - war crimes, the report then pays little, if any, attention to Hamas' obligations to the people of Gaza in its 575 pages.  Just as Israel is obligated under the law of war to take precautions to protect innocent civilians when it launches attacks, Hamas has corresponding obligations to protect civilians from the effects of those attacks.  Israel undertook massive, extensive precautions in accordance with those legal obligations.  Admittedly, as Israel's own investigations show us, there were a number of violations of the law that must be, and are being, addressed and punished.  </p>

<p>Hamas, in contrast, not only took no precautions to protect its own civilians, but affirmatively engaged in conduct that exacerbated the danger civilians faced from Israeli military operations.  The law forbids placing military objectives in densely populated areas, yet Hamas uses this as its primary strategy.  The law mandates that those who are fighting distinguish themselves from those who are not.  Part of the fundamental principle of distinction, this obligation helps protect innocent civilians from attack by making it possible for soldiers to assess who is the enemy and who is an innocent civilian.  Hamas turns this obligation on its head and seeks tactical advantages by fighting in civilian clothing and from within the civilian population.  </p>

<p>One would think that an international commission tasked with investigating violations of the law of war - a law designed in part to protect civilians - would come down particularly hard on any violations that threaten that fundamental purpose.  Think again.</p>

<p>The Goldstone Report's failure to condemn - or even criticize in any way - these and other violations of Hamas' obligations to its own civilians serves only to encourage such violations in this and future conflicts.  Such conduct is not unique to Gaza, of course; the Taliban specialize in the exploitation of the civilian population for strategic and tactical gain in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   For this reason, we cannot allow any dilution of legal protections in wartime.  That is why Israel, the United States and other militaries must abide by the law of war even in the face of enemies who exploit it.  Equally important, that is why we must redouble efforts to hold accountable those who use the civilian population as a shield or for tactical or strategic advantage.</p>

<p>The Report's effects risk stretching beyond the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Until any retractions regarding the report strongly and unquestionably condemn such violations and reaffirm the obligations of <em>all parties</em> to protect civilians, the Report will continue to undermine the law and pose a danger to the civilians the law seeks to protect.</p>

		<title>Obama and Congress Should Work Together to Repeal DOMA</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David J. Brunell is a 3L at Stetson University College of Law and is president of the school's Lambda Legal Society and chair of the Student Bar Association Diversity Committee...<br />
<hr height="1"><br />
<font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecently the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it would no longer defend in court Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which says that for federal purposes marriage is only between one man and one woman. This would certainly seem to be great news for LGBT-rights supporters since the Obama Administration is taking a pro-LGBT stance on the issue. But I have to ask whether this action -- or more appropriately, inaction -- is constitutional.</p>

<p>What's the problem? Essentially, there are two issues with the DOJ not defending DOMA: first, whether it is failing to follow separation of powers mandates; and second, whether it is forsaking its duty to enforce federal law.</p>

<p>As Chief Justice Marshall famously wrote in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> back in 1803, "it is emphatically the province of the Judicial [Branch] to say what the law is."</p>

<p>Not only is the DOJ failing to perform its duty to enforce federal law by not defending DOMA, by contending that DOMA is unconstitutional the DOJ is also trampling on the courts' responsibilities by attempting to speak for the courts. In short, the DOJ is acting unconstitutionally.</p>

<p>What's the solution? Let's rewind to a few years ago when the Obama Administration came under fire for enforcing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," a law it inherited from the Clinton and Bush Administrations that requires that openly-LGBT people be barred from military service. At that time, the Administration asserted that because Congress had passed the law, it was Congress's job to repeal it. The Administration then constitutionally engaged with Congress in working toward repeal by proposing legislation for Congress to debate, pass and send to the President. Congress would write a new law to replace the old one and President Obama would sign it. And that's what happened. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 is now law (and soon to be effective). Bottom line: the President didn't have to do anything unconstitutional in repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." This is reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>So I wonder why the Obama Administration is taking a different approach with DOMA than with "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." The Administration, through the DOJ, is asserting that DOMA, which is now on appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, won't survive if the Court uses something that other courts haven't used when considering challenges to DOMA -- heightened scrutiny. When a court evaluates a law in this posture, which presumes that a law is unconstitutional because it is either restricting a fundamental right or burdening people based on suspect classifications (like race), most laws will fail. Therefore, if heightened scrutiny is used, which DOJ is advocating, DOMA could be ruled unconstitutional on one or both of the following grounds -- the court could find that DOMA violates fundamental rights, such as marriage, and/or discriminates against a suspect class, such as (possibly) sexually orientation a classification to which the Supreme Court has not yet applied heightened scrutiny in such cases as <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> or <em>Romer v. Evans</em>.</p>

<p>One has to applaud this holding as it would mean that the federal government would end up recognizing same-sex marriages.</p>

<p>The real concern here is not what's being done, but rather who's doing it. There are two possible outcomes to the Administration's new approach to DOMA. The DOJ can do its job and defend DOMA. The second and better option, though, is for the Administration to work with Congress to repeal DOMA and advocate in favor of such bills as the Respect for Marriage Act, which follows the precedent set by "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and does just that. Now, that would be cause for celebration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It must also reach men who possess themselves of great power and make deliberate and concerted use of it to set in motion evils which leave no home in the world untouched.</em> -Robert H. Jackson, Opening statement for the prosecution before International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg, Germany, Nov. 1945, in the Trial of German Major War Criminals.</p>

<p>As the dust of recent events swirl about the Middle East, in West Africa and in south Asia, civilians and combatants alike are caught in a death-grip of pain, suffering, and atrocity.  From the horrific self-immolation of one brave Tunisian farmer a few months ago, the resulting rising up of oppressed people across the Maghreb shone the bright light of liberty and self-determination on crimes long left alone in need of accountability committed by dictators, tyrants, and thugs, in most instances propped up by the West during the Cold War.  When the dust settles in the Middle East, so ends the last visages of that war.</p>

<p>The alleged crimes being committed today by stricken governments reeling from this unrest are being broadcast, emailed, tweeted, and posted around the world.  Events that just five years ago would have gone unheeded may now be instantly uploaded and viewed almost in real-time by the international community.  In some instances, the world knows about an event before those in command are aware of the actions of their military, police, and other pro-government organizations.  It is becoming more difficult to sweep an atrocity under the rug.</p>

<p>With this instant knowledge and awareness of criminal activity, the international community now has the legal capability to deal with such crimes.  The principles laid down at Nuremberg and expanded upon by the various modern day international tribunals and courts are reflected in the Rome Statute that created the permanent International Criminal Court (the ICC).  No longer can heads of state and their governments shield themselves behind sovereign immunity or a brokered domestic amnesty.  </p>

<p>In Libya, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, and even Iran, the shadow of the ICC darkens the future of heads of state that rule or ruled with impunity.  Over time, accountability, not political resolution, will be the norm.  Though politics is and will remain a bright red thread in the fabric of international justice, politicians and diplomats are beginning the trend of comporting their political considerations and deliberations to the law. The recent referral by the United Nations Security Council to the ICC of allegations of crimes against humanity committed by Moammar Gadhafi is a hopeful step in the right direction and reflects the point made.</p>

<p>Yet despite this step forward, the ICC is not the future of international criminal law.  The future is in domestic and regional justice mechanisms investigating and prosecuting those who commit international crimes under their law in their region or country.  The ICC is a court of last resort, a cornerstone for accountability in an uncertain world used only when a state is unable or unwilling to prosecute their own.  This principle of complementarity places the burden of seeking justice for victims of international crimes squarely on the shoulders of States Parties.  </p>

<p>The likes of Gadhafi, Mubarak, Gbagbo, and others now must understand that at the beginning of the 21st century those who rule with impunity, killing their own citizens, will pay a price for those crimes. Other heads of state are now reevaluating their policies and positions regarding political and personal freedoms in the hopes of averting accountability.</p>

<p>Modern international criminal law is not a panacea.  It is not perfect, but the steps mankind has taken towards a more permanent capability to end impunity is, in the words of Justice Robert H. Jackson at Nuremberg, "...one of the most significant tributes that Power ever has paid to Reason." As the rule of law moves forward so will the long shadow of that law over those tyrants who rule by the gun and not the law.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">Liaquat Ali Khan</a> of Washburn University School of Law says that the recent events in the US are a continuation of a Western medieval custom of desecrating the Qur'an...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/khan-ali.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he recent Qur'an burning by Pastor Terry Jones, the author of <em>Islam is of the Devil</em>, is the continuation of a Western medieval custom of assaulting the dignity of Islam, particularly personal integrity of the Prophet Muhammad, and the divinity of the Qur'an, a holy book that more than a billion people, including American Muslims, hold dear to their hearts.  In recent years, the West has invoked the freedom of speech to defend new assaults on Islam, including the Danish publication of cartoons of the Prophet. Unfortunately, the post-9/11 United States, where attacks on the Qur'an are a relatively new phenomenon, is in the process of adopting the medieval custom.</p>

<p>Over the centuries, Western Europe has used various theological, literary, and popular justifications to sustain its medieval custom. In nurturing this custom, however, the West stands alone. Africans, Asians, and Eastern Europeans, rarely participate in desecrations of the Qur'an. The Chinese and Hindus, while celebrating their own religious and metaphysical traditions, have generally refrained from disrespecting the Qur'an. The Western contempt for the Qur'an, however, refuses to abate even though the West itself has undergone a radical transformation from medieval religiosity to modern secularism. </p>

<p>This commentary provides a brief historical insight into the medieval custom of desecrating the Qur'an and argues that the United States should resist the custom that sows the seeds of hatred, provokes violence, and barricades a meaningful dialogue between the West and Islam. The commentary also proposes that the United States must find legal ways to prevent desecrations of the Qur'an.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Medieval Custom</strong>  <br />
During the Middle Ages, the West frequently demonized the Qur'an on the basis of hearsay because the Qur'an was unavailable in vernacular languages. The first English translation of the Qur'an appeared in 1649 without a named translator, publisher, or printer. Anticipating hostility, the preface defended the translation saying that the ugliness of the Qur'an would enhance the beauty of the Gospels, for the Qur'an is, "without head or tail ... confused, contradictory in many things, written in rude language, consisting of lies and useless follies." This medieval conception of the Qur'an is deeply etched in the West.</p>

<p>In 1736, Voltaire, the celebrated French belletrist, wrote a five-act play Mahomet to highlight the depravity of Islam, and perhaps all religions.  A few years later, however, Voltaire revised his views and appreciated the Qur'an for removing idolatry. In the past few decades, new Western scholarship promoted a sensational thesis that the Qur'an is a fraudulent book concocted centuries after the Prophet's death, projected back in time, and falsely attributed to the Prophet Muhammad. This thesis was later retracted by the authors.</p>

<p>Western artists also contribute to desecrations of the Qur'an. In 2004, Dutch filmmaker Van Gogh produced a short film, called <em>Submission</em>, to highlight the subjugation of women that the Qur'an allegedly advocates. The film shows nude women wearing see-through veils with Arabic verses of the Qur'an etched on their bodies, insinuating that the Qur'an perpetuates their lack of freedom. An infuriated Moroccan murdered Van Gogh. While condemning the murder, another filmmaker opined, "Longtime readers of Van Gogh's weekly column in the Dutch newspaper "Metro" know very well that his intention was not to reform male chauvinism, but rather to express crude bigotry."</p>

<p>In the post 9/11 United States, the Qur'an is a prime target. In 2007, the information obtained from the FBI files revealed that Guantanamo prison guards threw the Qur'an in the toilet to torture Muslim detainees. The so-called experts on terrorism frequently cite verses of the Qur'an to argue that the Qur'an inspires violence against Jews and Christians. This April, Pastor Jones accused the Qur'an of fomenting terrorism and put the Qur'an on trial. In this mock trial held inside a church in Florida, a jury heard the evidence and found the Qur'an guilty. Upon conviction, the Qur'an was punished by being burned in a fire. Pastor Jones seeks shelter under the First Amendment to defend his odious expressive conduct. </p>

<p><strong>Questionable Expressive Conduct</strong><br />
In the language of law, Qur'an burning would be an expressive conduct. The First Amendment is generous in protecting oral and written word. It is less so with respect to expressive conduct. The First Amendment shelters expressive conduct if it does not threaten to disturb the peace. The United States Supreme Court declined to outlaw the burning of an American flag because, "no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur." <br />
The flag precedent does not apply because Qur'an burning is an expressive conduct that incites actual violence. So far Qur'an burning has produced instantaneous violence outside the United States. Given the presence of a growing population of American Muslims, Qur'an burning threatens domestic peace. Media and blog invectives may have forced Justice Stephen Breyer to retract his otherwise sound intuition that the First Amendment would not protect Qur'an burning. </p>

<p>Invoking their constitutional right, American Muslims should petition the United States Congress for a redress of grievances. They must demand constitutionally sound legislation that outlaws desecrations of the Qur'an. For Congress, such legislation will demonstrate to American Muslims that the United States is prepared to break away from the medieval custom of assaulting the dignity of the Qur'an. It will also send a powerful message to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, and the entire Muslim world, that the U.S. is neither Islamophobic, nor anti-Islamic, a move that can undermine terrorist threats to homeland security. </p>

<p>To their credit, Western European nations have adopted anti-hate statutes, which would proscribe burning of the Qur'an. A few days ago, the British government arrested a Welsh politician who allegedly burned a copy of the Qur'an. The British government has also banned Pastor Jones from entering the United Kingdom.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin G. Davis</a>, an Associate Professor of Law at University of Toledo College of Law, says that the recent response by the US to the Spanish torture case outlines the Obama Administration's approach to torture...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/bdavis.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif"height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>R</b></font>ecently, the US response to the Spanish prosecutor in the Spanish torture case became <a href="http://warisacrime.org/sites/afterdowningstreet.org/files/dodspain.pdf">available</a>. Unfortunately for justice, and for reasons I will describe below, last week the Spanish prosecutor decided to close the case and refer the matters to the Justice Department. <br />
 <br />
So let us look closely at the Department of Justice letter. </p>

<p>The letter is useful in providing insight into how the current administration has addressed torture claims against the prior administration. The heart of the letter has two parts: the first part is the discussion of the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) report and the subsequent Margolis report, which found Jay Bybee and John Yoo exercised poor judgment in their legal memoranda on interrogation of detainees, but declined to make a criminal or ethical referral. The second part is the decision that it was not appropriate to bring criminal cases with regard to any other executive branch officials who acted in reliance on these and other Office of Legal Counsel memoranda. Additionaly, the letter includes a <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issues_OPRReport.html">link</a> to the successive Office of Professional Responsibility reports that were made over several years. </p>

<p>In making his decision, I hope that the Spanish prosecutor read the letter together with the OPR reports, as they are instructive in detailing the mendacious, verging on obstructive, approach of executive branch officials in their interactions with the OPR, which was required to work without having subpoena power. The detailing by the OPR of the difficulties it encountered in bringing forward its investigation in all the steps up to the final Margolis report is an instructive lesson. The lesson shows how our system operates to attempt to thwart investigations so that higher-ups do not face accountability, let alone criminal responsibility.</p>

<p>In making his decision, I hope that the Spanish prosecutor kept in mind the memoirs of both President George W. Bush and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These memoirs came out subsequent to the OPR report. Their defense of the torture, or blaming it on a "few bad apples," I hope rang a bell in the mind of the Spanish prosecutor from the dirty wars in South America.</p>

<p>In making his decision, I hope that the Spanish prosecutor kept in mind the recent reversal of US policy in deciding to start up the military commissions for certain detainees in the War on Terror, many of whom were subject to torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment. This approach puts the victims of torture back in a third-class system that is a hermetically sealed conviction machine reserved only for foreigners. These approaches should hopefully suggest that in these matters of torture, America departs from meaningful judicial norms and the political branches are intent on keeping all in the dark, including American citizens and the world, about torture through these irregular processes.</p>

<p>Moreover, we did respect judicial norms and forms such as in the Ghailani prosecution in our civilian courts. However, the uproar of our political class in response to the verdict should help demonstrate to the Spanish prosecutor that leaders of both political parties are far too invested in convictions of our enemies to be capable of meaningfully evaluating and prosecuting torture by our own higher-ups.</p>

<p>In making his decision, I hope that the Spanish prosecutor kept in mind all the civil cases that have been brought by former detainees with regard to their treatment in various American courts and which have inevitably floundered against the rocks of the state secrets doctrine and others. Contrast this reality with the experiences of detainees in systems like the Canadian and English. </p>

<p>The US response to the Spanish prosecution of the lawyers has been fascinating because this prosecution focuses on the key link - and the weakest link - in the superstructure of torture that was put in place. The lawyers' reasoning provides a faded fig leaf of respectability for those who try to hide behind their legal ministrations.</p>

<p>As I have detailed in an earlier article, <em>Refluat Stercus: A Citizen's View of Criminal Prosecution in U.S. domestic courts of High-Level U.S. Civilian Authority and Military Generals for Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment,</em>, the legal and prosecutoral calculations in the American system under American law appear incapable so far to prosecute high-level civilians or military generals in situations such as this at least in our recent history.</p>

<p>Now, another effort in a foreign court is turned back under relentless US pressure and referred to our Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Some day, it may be necessary for a foreign court under universal jurisdiction and applying an international standard to take a step towards accountability precisely because of our leadership class' obvious resistance or incapability to reach above willing low-level soldiers or CIA contractors being used as scapegoats. The Italians are the only ones who have done something.  Germany, France, and Spain have blinked at American torture.  So it goes.  It ain't over til its over and the statute of limitations is still running on these guys.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty-staff/cborgmann.html">Caitlin Borgmann</a> of the City University of New York School of Law says the new wave of anti-abortion legislation in Congress and state legislatures is aimed at pushing the limits of the current constitutional framework and prompting its abandonment...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/borgmann.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he scores of anti-abortion bills pending and passing across the country following the November elections, including that just passed by the House of Representatives, present an astounding array of schemes for curtailing abortion. The measures generally follow one of three lines of attack.  The first approach is to push at the boundaries of the constitutional framework currently governing abortion laws and to make abortions as difficult as possible to obtain, even as women's right to abortion remains theoretically intact. A second approach aims to goad Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court's swing vote on abortion, into beginning to dismantle that constitutional framework (which he helped to create).  The final and most radical approach ignores the framework altogether and seeks to ban abortion from the earliest stages of embryonic development.</p>

<p>When the Supreme Court decided <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> in 1992, the controlling opinion, jointly authored by three justices including Justice Kennedy, weakened the constitutional protection for abortion and allowed more pre-viability restrictions than had been permissible under <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.  In the wake of this decision, many states began to pass laws that did not ban abortion but made it more difficult to obtain.  As long as these obstacles did not rise to the level of an "undue burden," courts upheld them.  While some in the anti-abortion-rights movement have objected to this incremental strategy, it is supported by the National Right to Life Committee.  Two of its leaders in a 2007 memo argued that the mounting restrictions will "translate into more disfavor for all abortions" and thereby ultimately help in overturning <em>Roe</em>.</p>

<p>In keeping with the chipping-away strategy, the first category of abortion restrictions aims to test the limits of what constitutes an "undue burden" by placing new obstacles in the path of women seeking abortions.  South Dakota, for example, recently passed a law requiring women to wait at least three days (the longest waiting period in the country) after meeting with her physician before she can obtain an abortion.  The woman also must first visit an anti-abortion center whose mission is to "consult[] with women for the purpose of helping them keep their relationship with their unborn children."  These centers often feed women false, frightening information about abortion, such as it causes breast cancer, a claim discredited by leading medical authorities including the National Cancer Institute.  In another popular effort to curtail abortion access, both state legislatures and members of Congress are seeking to prohibit even purely private insurance funds from being used for abortions.</p>

<p>The second type of abortion restriction, rather than merely stretching the limits of the current constitutional framework for abortion, endeavors to change one of its fundamental precepts and thereby set in motion the entire framework's ultimate collapse.  The popular post-twenty-week abortion ban, first passed by Nebraska in 2010 and adopted by several other states in 2011, is the key example of this type of legislation.  These bans prohibit nearly all abortions starting at twenty weeks after fertilization, when most fetuses are not yet viable.  Currently, abortions may not be banned before viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus.  Because viability varies with every pregnancy (and sometimes never occurs, as for example when a fetus's brain does not develop), it must therefore be left for the woman's physician to determine. The viability principle was vigorously affirmed by Justice Kennedy and his joint opinion co-authors in <em>Casey</em>.  Relying on dubious scientific assertions that fetuses can feel pain at twenty weeks after fertilization, conservative legislators have defended the post-twenty-week bans on the theory that the fetus's alleged ability to perceive pain justifies prohibiting abortions at this stage of pregnancy, even if the fetus is not yet viable.  What they have not explained is why the legislation is not simply directed at alleviating this purported pain through the administration of anesthesia and instead bars most (though not all) abortions during the relevant period.  The bans' plain intent is to replace the bright legal line that fetal viability currently occupies within the constitutional framework with the contested and uncertain concept of the onset of fetal pain perception.</p>

<p>The post-twenty-week bans' supporters probably recognize that it would be hard to persuade Justice Kennedy to abandon wholesale the right to abortion he upheld in <em>Casey</em> and instead hope to convince him to make a more modest change to the constitutional framework. Other legislators are more impatient and seek to jettison <em>Roe</em> entirely by banning abortion at the earliest stages of embryonic development.  Some proposals do so by defining legal personhood as beginning at conception.  For example, Alabama SB 301 provides that the "term 'persons' as used in the Code of Alabama 1975, shall include any human being from the moment of fertilization." These measures are the most radical, since they would not only ban all abortions and some forms of contraception, but could sow mass confusion in many other contexts including criminal laws, tax laws, inheritance rights, census-taking, assisted reproduction and other medical care, and far more.</p>

<p>Another bill that attempts to ban abortions throughout pregnancy is Ohio's "heartbeat" bill, a measure that asserts the fetal heartbeat, not the onset of fetal pain perception, is the milestone in embryonic development on which bans should be premised.  This bill would ban abortions at the point when the embryo's heartbeat becomes "detectable ... according to standard medical practice."  During the legislative hearing at which two fetuses were supposed to "testify" via amplification of their heartbeats, an ultrasound of a woman nine weeks pregnant failed to produce an audible heartbeat.  Nevertheless, an embryo's heartbeat is generally medically detectable some time around four to five weeks after fertilization, meaning that such a ban would prohibit abortion from the beginning of the first trimester.</p>

<p>The variety of attacks on abortion seen across the country this year may seem scattershot and haphazard, but they all reflect the same unifying goal: to remove abortion as an option for women with unintended or untenable pregnancies and instead force women to carry those pregnancies to term.  While the different approaches hew to different timelines for obliterating women's reproductive freedom, supporters of all three envision a day when a woman's ability to determine the fate of her own pregnancy is a thing of the past.</p>

Westbrook</a>, of the University at Buffalo Law School, says that Congress should announce that Koran burning and other inflammatory gestures are inconsistent with American values ...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/westbrook_david.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>L</b></font>ast month, Terry Jones, the pastor of a Florida church, had a Koran burned and posted the proceedings on YouTube. In response, a mob in Afghanistan killed at least 20 people, many of them UN relief workers.</p>

<p>In what has become a routine, an act of violence against the expression of Islamic faith was answered by violence against persons. Criticism of Pastor Jones' clearly provocative act has been countered with an invocation of the First Amendment's right to free speech. The US government's failure to respond powerfully lends plausibility to assertions that the United States is hostile to Islam, undercutting our pursuit of both war and peace.</p>

<p>But Congress can act. Congress should address this impasse by declaring that burning the Koran and similar insults to Islam, or indeed to any faith, are inconsistent with U.S. values. </p>

<p>For Muslims, the "Holy Koran" is, itself, holy, not merely a text that may be reproduced, or destroyed, without consequence. As a result, actions like that of Pastor Jones cannot be dismissed by Muslims as ignorant publicity stunts.</p>

<p>The Muslim sensitivity to insults to Islam is not new. In many lands and over many centuries, Muslims have suffered hurtful indignities, including Koran burning. It is against this older and broader context that many Muslims are inclined to understand Pastor Jones. From this perspective Jones is not an anomaly but instead exemplifies the hostility to Islam traditional in the West.</p>

<p>The opponents of U.S. interests in Afghanistan and elsewhere need the United States to be against Islam. They need the United States to be the latest incarnation of historical enemies. So, for those who care about peace, it is vital that Muslims and non-Muslims understand that insults to Islam, especially Koran burning, are not acceptable in American society.</p>

<p>A declaration of American respect for Islam and all religions is perfectly consistent with our robust First Amendment jurisprudence, which precludes simply outlawing Koran burning. Even desecration of our own national symbols (flag burning) is allowed. Moreover, the United States is uniquely enthusiastic about labeling activities "speech," thereby making regulation virtually impossible. </p>

<p>It is hardly clear that our permissive understanding of free speech has actually produced better political discourse. Many Americans were appalled when the Supreme Court recently upheld, as constitutionally protected speech, the shouting of insults at the funerals of fallen soldiers.</p>

<p>But whether or not U.S. First Amendment protections are too permissive is not the point here. In dealing with politically troubling speech, as Justice Brandeis famously said, the traditional "remedy to be applied is more speech." What is needed now is precisely "more speech:" the United States Congress should respond to Pastor Jones. Nothing in the First Amendment prevents our representatives from passing a "Declaration of the Sense of Congress" condemning the burning of the Koran.</p>

<p>Of course, Congress cannot respond to every group in the United States that finds itself offended by the actions of some other group or individual. It is also true that the United States currently has military engagements across the Muslim world. Bin Laden and others have said that the United States is at war with Islam. But our citizens, our allies, and even our adversaries - especially our adversaries, or those who might become adversaries - need to know that Islam can be at home in the United States, and that our wars are fought in defense of core interests, not out of hostility to Islam.</p>

<p>The U.S. Congress therefore should declare something along these lines:<br />
<blockquote>We condemn acts intended as offenses to the Islamic faith. We condemn, in particular, the burning of the Koran.</p>

<p>None of the military operations of the United States reflect an anti-Islamic sentiment on the part of the American people, or an anti-Islamic policy on the part of the U.S. government.</p>

<p>It is the sense of Congress that offenses against all faiths are inconsistent with our national values. Islam is the faith of millions of our own respected citizens.</blockquote></p>

		<title>Why the Individual Health Care Mandate is Unconstitutional</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/somin_ilya">Ilya Somin</a> of George Mason School of Law says the lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act are far from frivolous. They deserve to prevail and have a real chance of doing so...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/Ilya_Somin.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>wenty-eight states and several private groups have now filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Obama health care plan</a>.  One of the cases was filed by twenty-six state governments and the National Federation of Independent Business in a federal court in Florida.  Another was initiated by the Commonwealth of Virginia in a federal court in that state. Numerous other suits have been filed by a variety of private groups.</p>

<p>When the first of these suits began a year ago, many denounced them as frivolous political grandstanding.  But it is increasingly clear that the plaintiffs have a real chance of winning.  More importantly, they deserve to win because the mandate really is unconstitutional.  If upheld, it would give Congress a dangerous power that greatly exceeds the bounds of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The cases focus primarily on challenges to the new law's "individual mandate," which requires most American citizens to purchase a government-approved health insurance plan by 2014 or pay a fine. So far, federal district court judges in the Florida and Virginia cases have ruled that the mandate is unconstitutional, while three others have upheld it in cases filed by private parties in Michigan, a different court in Virginia, and Washington, DC.</p>

<p>The federal government claims that Congress has the power to impose the mandate under the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Tax Clause of the Constitution. All three arguments have a common defect: if accepted by the courts, they would give Congress the power to enact virtually any mandate of any kind. Such a ruling would be unprecedented and would make a hash of the Constitution's carefully defined limits on federal power.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">The Commerce Clause</div>

<p>The administration has relied most heavily on the Commerce Clause, which was the basis of all three decisions upholding the mandate. The Clause gives Congress authority to regulate "Commerce . . . among the several states."  But the individual mandate regulates that which is neither commercial nor interstate. Virtually all purchases of health insurance are intrastate because a combination of state and federal law makes it illegal to purchase health insurance across state lines. Moreover, the object of the mandate is not even commerce at all. Instead of regulating preexisting commerce, the bill forces people to engage in commercial transactions they would have otherwise avoided. </p>

<p>At the time of the Founding, the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution consistently interpreted the Commerce Clause as only giving Congress the power to regulate interstate transportation and trade in goods and services across state lines. Even Alexander Hamilton, the strongest advocate of broad federal authority among the Founding Fathers, took this view. This was also roughly the approach adopted by the Supreme Court during the first 150 years of American history.</p>

<p>Many defenders of the mandate claim that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to impose any regulations that have a significant impact on interstate commerce. But that would render most of the rest of the congressional powers listed in Article I of the Constitution redundant. The very same phrase that gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce also gives it the power to regulate "Commerce with foreign Nations" and "with the Indian Tribes."  Obviously, both international commerce and Indian commerce (which was a much more important part of the economy in the 18th century than today), have a major impact on interstate commerce and the economy as a whole.  If the power to regulate interstate commerce gave Congress the power to impose any regulations that have an effect on the economy, these other powers become completely superfluous. The same goes for many of Congress' other enumerated powers, such as the power to coin money, the power to establish "Post Offices and post Roads," and even the power to "raise and support Armies." The exercise of all of these powers inevitably has major effects on the economy.</p>

<p>Defenders of the individual mandate often cite Chief Justice John Marshall's famous opinion in the 1824 case of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0022_0001_ZO.html">Gibbons v. Ogden</a> as a justification for their position. <em>Gibbons</em> did indeed define commerce as "intercourse." But the intercourse in question was economic trade across state lines. <em>Gibbons</em> did not give Congress the power to impose any regulations that might have some economic effect. To make the point clear, Chief Justice Marshall listed a wide range of regulations that fall outside the scope of the commerce power, including "[i]nspection laws, quarantine laws," and most relevant to the mandate case "health laws of every description."</p>

<p>A series of flawed Supreme Court decisions have expanded Congress' Commerce Clause authority well beyond what the text of the Constitution permits. These rulings allow the federal government to regulate almost any "economic activity." But even they do not give Congress the power to impose mandates solely on the basis of a person's residence in the United States. Far from engaging in "economic activity," people who decide not to purchase health insurance are actually <em>refraining</em> from doing so.</p>

<p>The most expansive Supreme Court Commerce Clause decision of all time was its 2005 ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZO.html">Gonzales v. Raich</a>, which held that Congress had the power to ban possession of medical marijuana that had never crossed state lines or been sold in any market.  <em>Raich</em> was an extremely dubious decision that pushed congressional power far beyond its constitutional limits. But even that opinion did not go far enough to justify the individual mandate. In <em>Raich</em>, the Court ruled that Congress could ban the possession of medical marijuana because the latter qualifies as "economic activity," defined as anything that involves "production, distribution, and consumption of commodities."  People without health insurance are not producing, consuming, or distributing a commodity of any kind. To the contrary, they have chosen <em>not</em> to do any of these things. </p>

<p>Some defenders of the law claim that the individual mandate is similar to federal laws banning racial discrimination by businesses such as motels and restaurants. But federal anti-discrimination laws apply only to preexisting businesses already engaged in commercial activity in the relevant industry. By contrast, uninsured individuals are not businesses and, by definition, are <em>not</em> participating in the insurance industry. The civil rights laws do not require anyone to open up a business or start hiring employees. They merely forbid discrimination by those who do.</p>

<p>In his decision upholding the mandate in the Michigan case, Judge George Caram Steeh argued that the mandate is constitutional under the Commerce Clause because deciding not to purchase health insurance is an "economic decision." "Economic decisions," he asserted, include decisions <em>not</em> to engage in economic activity. Similar reasoning was adopted by the other two district judges who have upheld the mandate. In the Washington, DC case, Judge Gladys Kessler argued that "[m]aking a choice is an affirmative action, whether one decides to do something or not do something." This approach would allow the Commerce Clause to cover any choice of any kind. Any decision to do anything is necessarily a decision <em>not</em> to use the same time and effort to engage in "economic activity." If I choose to spend an hour sleeping, I necessarily choose not to spend that time working, buying products, or purchasing health insurance. Under Steeh's logic, the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to force workers to get up earlier in the morning so that they would spend more time on the job.</p>

<p>Judge Kessler managed to go even further than this, suggesting that Congress has the power to regulate "decision-making" because it is "mental activity." Under her reasoning, the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate thought as well as action and inaction. After all, thinking of any kind is "mental activity" too.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">Is Health Care Special?</div>

<p>Recognizing that they probably cannot win under the Commerce Clause by arguing that Congress has the power to impose any mandate with some kind of economic effect, defenders of the insurance mandate have tried to get around the problem by arguing that health care is a special case. The federal government claims that forcing people to purchase health insurance actually does regulate economic activity because everyone eventually uses health care in some form. For that reason, Judge Steeh argues, people who choose not to buy health insurance are making "an economic decision to try to pay for health care later," using some other means of payment. Three district courts have upheld the law in part on this basis. But as Judge Henry Hudson pointed out in the Virginia decision striking down the mandate, "the same reasoning could apply to transportation, housing, or nutritional decisions. This broad definition of the economic activity subject to congressional regulation lacks logical limitation." This logic would give Congress the power to force everyone to purchase a car because everyone eventually uses some form of "transportation."</p>

<p>The fact that most people eventually use health care does not differentiate health insurance from almost any other market of any significance. If you define the relevant "market" broadly enough, you can characterize any decision not to purchase a good or service exactly the same way. Notice that the government does not argue that everyone will inevitably use health <em>insurance</em>. Instead, they define the market as "health <em>care</em>." The same bait and switch tactic works for virtually any other mandate Congress might care to impose.</p>

<p>Consider the famous example of the broccoli mandate raised by Judge Roger Vinson in the Florida case. Not everyone eats broccoli. But everyone inevitably participates in the market for "food." Therefore, a mandate requiring everyone to purchase and eat broccoli would be permissible under the federal government's argument. The same goes for a mandate requiring everyone to purchase General Motors cars in order to help the auto industry. There are many people who don't participate in the market for cars. But just about everyone participates in the market for "transportation." We all need to get from place to place somehow. How about a mandate requiring all Americans to see the new Harry Potter movie? After all, just about everyone participates in some way in the market for "entertainment."</p>

<p>In her decision upholding the mandate, DC district court judge Gladys Kessler argued that health care is special because providers are required to provide emergency services to the uninsured, which is not true of most other markets. But why is that difference constitutionally relevant? The answer seems to be that failure to purchase thereby has adverse economic effects on producers. Put that way, of course, failure to purchase health insurance turns out to be no different from failure to purchase any other product. Any time someone fails to purchase a product, be it cars, movie tickets, or broccoli, producers are made economically worse off than they would be if the potential buyer had made a different decision. This is true regardless of whether the producers must provide services to some consumers for free or not. At most, the latter condition exacerbates the negative impact on producers, but all sorts of other market conditions and government regulations can negatively affect producers as well. Moreover, Judge Kessler's approach would allow Congress to impose any mandate of any kind so long as producers must provide their product to at least some consumers for free. This too is a road to virtually unlimited federal power to impose mandates. Producers in any industry would be happy to accept a minor "free service" obligation so long as it was coupled with a more lucrative purchase mandate.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">The Tax Clause</div>

<p>The federal government also contends that the mandate is constitutional because it is a tax authorized by Congress' power to impose taxes for the "general Welfare." All four federal judges who have ruled on this claim so far have rejected it, including two who concluded that the mandate is constitutional under the Commerce Clause. They correctly recognized that the mandate is a financial penalty for refusing to comply with a federal regulation. As Judge Vinson pointed out, congressional leaders consistently emphasized before the law's enactment that it was not a tax.</p>

<p>As recently as 1996, the Supreme Court reiterated the crucial distinction between a penalty and a tax. It ruled that "[a] tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the Government," while a penalty is "an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act" or - as in the case of the individual mandate - an unlawful omission. The individual mandate is a clear example of a penalty, where Congress requires people to purchase health insurance, and then punishes them with a fine if they fail to comply.</p>

<p>In September 2009, President Obama himself noted that "for us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase." He was right. If the mandate qualifies as a tax merely because it punishes violators with a fine, then Congress could require Americans to do almost anything on pain of having to pay a fine if they refuse. It could use this power to force citizens to buy virtually any product, including broccoli, General Motors cars, or anything else.</p>

<p>Even if the individual mandate does somehow qualify as a tax, it is not one of the types of taxes that Congress is authorized to impose. The Constitution gives Congress the power to enact several types of taxes: Excise taxes, duties and imposts, income taxes, and "direct taxes" that must be apportioned among the states in proportion to population.</p>

<p>No one, including the federal government, claims that the individual mandate is a duty or an impost. The individual mandate is not an income tax because an income tax must target some "accession to wealth," in the words of <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/348/426/case.html">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Glenshaw Glass Co.</a>, the leading Supreme Court case on the subject. The fine imposed by the mandate does not target any accession to wealth or flow of income. It simply forces individuals to pay a penalty if they disobey the federal government's regulatory requirement. The fact that low-income individuals are exempted does not change this analysis. A fine for jaywalking would not become an income tax if low-income individuals were exempted from it. The same goes for a fine imposed for violation of a law requiring the purchase of health insurance.</p>

<p>It is even more implausible to suggest that the mandate is an excise tax. Excise taxes apply to economic transactions or the use of property of some kind. For example, a tax on the sale of alcoholic beverages qualifies as an excise. The individual mandate does not tax any kind of activity, use of property or economic transaction. It therefore cannot be an excise tax.</p>

<p>If the mandate is not a tariff, impost, income tax, or excise tax, it is either a direct tax or no tax at all. And if it is a direct tax, it would be an unconstitutional one, because it is not apportioned among the states in proportion to population as the Constitution requires.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">The Necessary and Proper Clause</div>

<p>The federal government also argues that the mandate is authorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause, which gives Congress the power to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution" other powers Congress is granted by the Constitution. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has defined "necessary" broadly to include anything that is "useful or convenient" for the execution of any federal power. Under this broad definition of "necessary," the mandate arguably qualifies. The federal government argues that requiring people to purchase health insurance is needed to ensure that people will not wait to buy health insurance until after they get sick, something they may be incentivized to do because the health care bill forbids insurance companies from turning away customers with preexisting conditions.</p>

<p>But even if the mandate is "necessary," it is not "proper" under our constitutional system of limited federal authority. In cases such as <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/95-1478.ZO.html">Printz v. United States</a> in 1997, the Court has emphasized that these are two separate requirements imposed by the Clause. Congressional legislation must meet both.</p>

<p>If the Clause allows Congress to adopt the individual mandate, the same logic would justify almost any other requirement Congress might impose on individuals, thereby gutting the principle of limited federal power. Pretty much any mandate could be defended as "useful or convenient" for the execution of one congressional power or another.  Since the Court has ruled that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate almost any "economic activity," any purchase mandate will fly. After all, such a mandate can always be portrayed as part of a plan to regulate the relevant market. Thus, the broccoli mandate would be upheld as an effort to regulate the market in food, the auto purchase mandate as a regulation of the market in cars, and so on.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has provided very little guidance on the definition of "proper." But evidence from the Founding era suggests that a proper statute must, at the very least, not depend on a constitutional rationale that gives Congress virtually unlimited power to impose any mandates of any kind. As James Madison explained in <em>Federalist</em> 39, the Constitution does not give the federal government "an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things." The federal government's interpretation of the Clause threatens to do just that.  </p>

<div style="text-align: center;">Why This Slippery Slope Matters</div>

<p>Lawyers are notorious for inventing imaginative but unrealistic slippery slope arguments. The slippery slope that would result from a decision upholding the individual mandate, however, is all too real. If Congress is given unconstrained authority to impose purchase mandates, many interest groups could follow where the health insurance industry has led.</p>

<p>There are numerous industry interest groups that would dearly love to get congressional legislation requiring people to buy their products. And Congress has a long history of enacting dubious interest group legislation. Indeed, the individual health insurance mandate was itself partly the result of such interest group pressure. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama harshly criticized Hillary Clinton for proposing the idea, saying that "[f]orcing people to buy health insurance [in order to provide them with health care] is like forcing the homeless to buy a house to eliminate homelessness." Yet he later reversed his position in part as a result of a political bargain the administration struck with insurance companies.</p>

<p>In a time of tight budget constraints, a purchase mandate has obvious attractions to politicians seeking to aid politically influential industries.  A mandate can transfer money to the favored industry without requiring additional government spending or tax increases.  It is difficult for the federal government to directly transfer as much money to an industry as it would by  forcing millions of new customers to make purchases.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is a wide variety of ways that purchase mandates could be sold to the public. Congress need not admit that they are intended to help powerful interest groups at the expense of the general public. They could instead use the same justification for government bailouts of banks and auto manufacturers - stimulating the economy by helping a vital industry. Forcing people to purchase broccoli or other food could also be defended as a public health measure. Indeed, paternalists have successfully advocated numerous coercive regulations on precisely those kinds of grounds. There is no reason why they could not use similar strategies to justify purchase mandates. An alliance between well-intentioned paternalists and rapacious industry interest groups is precisely the kind of "baptist-bootlegger" coalition that has often been successful in the past. Just as moralists once united with bootleggers to promote alcohol prohibition, paternalistic public health activists could unite with industry lobbyists to push through purchase mandates.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to emphasize the sheer range of interests that come into play here. The logic of the pro-health care mandate argument can justify virtually any mandate to purchase or do anything. This opens the door to the machinations of an extraordinarily large number of interest groups. It is likely that at least a few of them will figure out a way to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>The legal battle over the mandate is far from over. The five district court rulings issued so far are just the first stage of the process. All of them will be reviewed by federal courts of appeals. Eventually, the issue is likely to be decided by the Supreme Court. There, the anti-mandate plaintiffs still face a difficult struggle. The Supreme Court rarely strikes down a law that is a centerpiece of the political agenda of the president and his party. Nonetheless, it is now clear that the lawsuits are far from frivolous. They deserve to prevail and have a real chance of doing so.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin G. Davis</a>, an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Toledo College of Law, answers a few questions about Osama Bin Laden's death and discusses what it might mean in terms of foreign affairs and domestic attitudes towards torture...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/bdavis.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif"height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><tdcolspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>W</b></font>e have learned that Osama Bin Laden has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a>. Was this killing done in accordance with international law?</p>

<p>While the facts are a bit unclear, some points would seem clear.</p>

<p>1) Osama bin Laden was a legitimate military objective. In this armed conflict of either an international or non-international character, what seems patently clear is that Bin Laden was the head of Al-Qaeda, a non-state-actor that has declared war on the United States. Wars between states and non-state actors have gone on since antiquity and targeting the head of Al-Qaeda and the disruption of Al-Qaeda are clear military objectives by which we secure a military advantage.</p>

<p>2) The residence was also a proper military target. The residence in Abbottabad appears to have been constructed in 2005 and to have been in the form of what we would call a bunker or bunkerized residence - its high walls, barbed wire etc. It appears it was built for Osama Bin Laden and was a headquarters for him in running the Al-Qaeda operations since 2005. As such, if it ever had a civilian purpose, it had turned from a purely civilian to a military object once Bin Laden had his "quartier general" there and was sending and receiving instructions for Al-Qaeda through couriers.</p>

<p>3) A clear military advantage could be achieved through killing or capturing Bin Laden. He was a still active member of Al-Qaeda, leading Al-Qaeda efforts from this site. Killing or capturing him would be the classic decapitating type operation almost identical to Bin Laden's attempt to do the same to the United States on 9/11 in attacking the financial center as well as military and other top nerve centers of the United States government. Necessity of targeting Bin Laden as Al-Qaeda's spiritual, strategic and tactical leader who claimed responsibility for 9/11 to put him hors de combat would appear without doubt.</p>

<p>4) The attack on Bin Laden was proportional. There is a question whether Bin Laden's wife was a human shield (making Bin Laden responsible for her as war crime) or not (less responsible) and, logically, whether or not she was a civilian or an Al-Qaeda operative. Assuming that she was a true civilian then the question is whether her death as collateral damage was proportional. I think that given the military objective and military advantage to be gained and the approach of the weaponry in a situation of a firefight, this situation would be easier to see as proportional. I understand the other persons in the compound were either couriers or Al-Qaeda operatives who engaged in the firefight. These other persons were also legitimate targets with the exception of one - Bin Laden's son Khalid. Assuming that Khalid and Bin Laden's wife were true civilians does not change the proportionality calculus much given the enormous role of Bin Laden in Al-Qaeda.</p>

<p>5) Whether this operation is viewed under a law enforcement, self-defense, or armed conflict vision (the three visions discussed by those in this arena), the consent by Pakistan for such an attack on its soil by the US against Bin Laden was longstanding in the relationship with Pakistan as our ally in this war against Al-Qaeda. Whether, if needed at all, a specific consent was needed immediately before the specific operation appears related to the Pakistan-US bilateral relationship (international relations) more than international law. In the absence of a firefight, would we have been entitled to kill Bin Laden? I do not believe so. However, the firefight moots that discussion as deadly force is permitted in such a setting under any of the three visions provided. It meets the standards of necessity and proportionality already discussed. In the face of a firefight, I do not see the variations in standards under the three visions leading to a different conclusion as to the legality and the legitimacy of killing Bin Laden.</p>

<p>6) Whether there is a problem with Bin Laden's burial at sea relates to the question of what is done with the body of someone killed in armed conflict. I am not aware of a specific international rule on this point other than not to defile the dead. I believe that usually the person is turned over to the state from which they are from or to the family of the person, but I believe that burial of dead enemies also occurs. Here the military concerns about the future (creating a shrine for martyrdom similar to the concerns that led to Eichmann being buried at sea) militated against either of the first two options. Bin Laden being a Saudi national, if there are issues with the way his body was buried at sea, the Bin Laden family may seek to have their concerns espoused by the Saudis on their behalf or Saudi Arabia can take it up with the United States. I am not seeing the burial of enemy dead at sea as a war crime.</p>

<p>In any event, I do think that the martyrdom site issue is not laid to rest as the compound in Abbottabad is a likely candidate to become such a place for Al-Qaeda sympathizers. Having that compound torn down once its intelligence utility is exploited will be another aspect of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship.</p>

<p>7) On several websites the manner in which the intelligence was received on Bin Laden's whereabouts is being discussed and very quickly a meme that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/02/press-briefing-senior-administration-officials-killing-osama-bin-laden">"torture works"</a> [press release] is being presented (see <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/">lawfareblog.com</a>, <a href="http://www.keepamericasafe.com/">keepamericasafe.com</a>, and <a href="http://opiniojuris.org/">opiniojuris.com</a> for example).</p>

<p>This meme is no doubt migrating and metastasizing across the internet right now. The "torture works" theory seeming to be put forward is that the key courier was one for KSM and Al-Libbi and so their torture was how we got the name. From what I can see, the press briefing speaks generally of interrogation of detainees but does not address the question of whether this intelligence came from the torture. Once again, by those who long have tried to defend torture, what is being done is to instrumentalize the Bin Laden capture and the intelligence gathering related to it over a number of years to have us think that torture worked in some sense.</p>

<p>I do not know the timeline and I doubt that a true accounting will ever be provided, unless in a court of law. What I do know is that the twenty years these intelligence efforts have been going on belies the notion of imminence or hot pursuit of the infamous "ticking time bomb scenario." The whole tenor of what is described so far is dogged painstaking work, not Jack Bauer 24 style torture. I note the studied ambiguity in describing what happens has the unfortunate effect of leaving an impression that torture was of some significant role in this operation. This ambiguity may serve the purpose of deflecting momentum in the United States to criminally prosecute those who broke our laws by committing torture. This developing meme is a further example of the "acquiescence to torture" machine at work.</p>

<p>In our euphoria over Bin Laden's demise, we should not let ourselves descend farther into vengefulness. With lucidity, we should endeavor to continue the battle internally to hold accountable those who tortured in our name. Because of the speed of the "torture works" meme coming out, I would suspect that it was extremely counterproductive for the kind of work that led us to Bin Laden. People who committed the torture crime should be held accountable just as those who commit war crimes on the other side. Refluat Stercus.</p>

<p>8) As to prosecution, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22military%20commissions%22">military commissions</a> for those who remain in U.S. custody contrast significantly with the legality of the Bin Laden operation. Just like the "torture works" meme, let us stand firm against the military commissions meme to show the world - including those who vow revenge on the United States and ourselves - that we trust in our normal judicial structures to assure that justice occurs both in our ordinary judicial fora and at the barrel of a gun in a firefight in Abbottabad.</p>

<p>9) I fear that Bin Laden's demise is not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning of something that may be much crazier. As a citizen, I salute all those involved in getting this done and am eternally grateful for their efforts. At the same time, I have no illusion about this war being over. I do think the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22middle%20east%22+AND+protest">Arab Spring</a> provides an opportunity for internal self-determination in autocratic regimes, reducing the appeal of Al-Qaeda, but because the future of the Arab Spring is extremely hard to predict we must remain vigilant. Of the countries in the Middle East, I am worried most about Iraq and Syria as places where Al-Qaeda will get traction because of the questions for the people as to the legitimacy of their rulers. In my opinion, the current Saudi ability to buy off all of its population (unlike Iraq or Syria) makes it less of a concern for the near future. Libya is in a state of flux at present and the defeat of Gaddhafi would provide an opportunity for meaningful internal self-determination. As do the ongoing situations in Egypt and Yemen. At the same time, I am certain that Al-Qaeda will renew its efforts to gain control of aspects of the sovereign in all of these countries. Every monarch must watch their back. The times require from us a sustained and nuanced effort to encourage local means of internal self-determination in collaboration with the rest of the international community.</p>

<p>10) Though we may be so tempted, to avoid hubris we should not go it alone but continue the difficult task of coalition building with other countries to continue to fight the scourge of Al-Qaeda and confront the terrorists. This effort must include a willingness to address the Palestinian/Israeli concerns. There are good people that I love on both sides of the Israeli/Palestinian struggle and they need to find a way forward.</p>

<p><em><strong>Updated May 4, 2011</strong></em></p>

<p>The more recent reports have stated that Bin Laden was unarmed at the time he was killed. On the interrogation and military commission points&#8212;the wave of comments since May 2, 2011 do not alter my views.<br />
 <br />
There are three generic potential legal regimes that have been discussed regarding the legality of the Bin Laden's killing: the law of armed conflict (international humanitarian law or IHL), self-defense, and law enforcement. <br />
 <br />
Even though he was unarmed, the killing was clearly lawful under the law of armed conflict, clearly lawful under the law of self-defense, and a closer call under the law enforcement regime.<br />
 <br />
Under the law of armed conflict, Bin Laden can be a military objective.  For example, he could be shot unarmed sitting at lunch because there is a military advantage in killing him, it is necessary to kill him, and that approach would be proportional.  Killing him with a nuclear bomb in that scenario would not be legal because while there is a military advantage, a nuclear bomb is not proportional.  If, however, Bin Laden had already surrendered, then killing him would be an unlawful killing.  Unarmed does not mean that the person has surrendered and is no longer a threat.  We will have to see whether the reports of him having resisted are "walked back" also. I would note that there is a distinction made between armed conflict of an international and a non-international character but I do not believe that changes this analysis.<br />
 <br />
Under self-defense, the intersection between IHL and international human rights law (IHRL) is more significant.  Some say that IHL applies by analogy while others see IHRL as applying and some see it as mixed.  For me, the point is that issues of military advantage, necessity, and proportionality apply here also and the analysis leads me to the same place.<br />
 <br />
Under law enforcement, in trying to arrest Bin Laden one is aware that he has used deadly force on a massive scale or threatened the use of deadly force on a massive scale even though he is unarmed.  So a situation arose in which deadly force could be used even though he was unarmed. If he had not surrendered and had not resisted, the case is closer on the appropriateness of the use of deadly force in trying to capture him.<br />
 <br />
In none of the three cases should we assume he had surrendered and was a prisoner at the time the deadly force was used.  All we know is that he was unarmed, and the SEALS came upon him after a firefight in the compound in which people were killed or wounded.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a>, professor of law at Webster University and Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, says that the action against Osama Bin Laden violated international law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/curtisdoebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>W</b></font>hatever one might think of Osama Bin Laden&#8212;a terrorist for his alleged role in killing several thousand Westerners or a freedom fighter against American imperialism that has killed an estimated two million Afghanis and Iraqis&#8212;his targeted killing was a violation of international law.</p>

<p>International prohibits targeted killings in several ways.</p>

<p>First, a targeted killing, as this one was, is carried out often by the use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of a foreign state. In this case the President of Pakistan has made it clear that his country did not authorize the American action. Instead, the US sent about two dozen troops in helicopters into Pakistani airspace and attacked a house in a civilian neighborhood without the permission of the Pakistani government. National security, one of the most crucial attributes of both political independence and territorial integrity, was violated.</p>

<p>Second, targeted killings are summary and extrajudicial executions that violate the right to life. It is hard to believe that the US had no other option but to kill Osama Bin Laden. According to US reports he was killed by two gun shots to the head at close range fired from American soldiers' guns. Moreover, after he was killed, the US claims they took his body. These facts indicate that the well armed and protected US troops operating illegally on foreign soil could have made an attempt to capture Osama Bin Laden, but instead merely executed him.</p>

<p>When a life is taken in the course of an illegal action there is a prima facie violation of the human right to life. Even American law makes killing carried out during the commission of another crime a more serious offense. Moreover, if this was not the case, states could merely elevate a situation in which they were acting to the level of an armed conflict so as to label their targets combatants and thus enemies who may be lawfully killed. Such action is discredited, even by the US itself, who has admonished leaders in the Middle East for the use of excessive force against their people even when those leaders have claimed to be dealing with a war.</p>

<p>US President Barack Obama and other US spokespersons have claimed that the troops acted to ensure there was not a loss of life on their side of the operation. They seem to have no qualms, however, about killing an apparently innocent woman. They claim she was being used as a human shield, which even if true does not justify her killing. It is in fact a claim frequently made by Israeli soldiers to justify the murder of unarmed women in Palestine.</p>

<p>Similarly attempts to justify targeted killings as acts of self-defense or in the interest of national security are fanciful illusions usually put forward by unapologetic and energetic proponents of American exceptionalism to international law. Leading human rights groups like Amnesty International, the UN Human Rights Council, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions have roundly condemned targeted killing as violations of the human right to life. There is no credible human rights lawyer that supports such killings.</p>

<p>In any event, any American claims of justification in a situation involving the taking of life requires that the US prove it acted out of necessity or some other legal justification. Not only has the US failed to provide such proof, it has destroyed the best evidence&#8212;the body of the victim. It did so claiming that it had to provide Osama Bin Laden a traditional Muslim burial. A burial at sea after a person is killed on land and without their family and friends present is the farthest thing one can imagine from Islamic tradition. Instead, anecdotal evidence has emerged about how Osama Bin Laden and at least one woman were shot while unarmed and their bodies removed by their assailants. Moreover, the subsequent quick disposal of Osama Bin Laden's body at sea makes it appear as if those who executed him were trying to dispose of the evidence of their acts.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the US action, however satisfying to the America thrust for blood-retribution for the terrible acts against its people on September 11, 2001, may have set back efforts to bring peace and security to the world through the promotion of human rights. It may be true that Osama Bin Laden was taunting America, using the restraints of the rule of law. That he was saying: "If you think you can kill or capture me within your laws, try to do so." In the end, he and we showed it was not possible. Instead, the US had to act in violation of the sovereignty of another state and had to carry out an extrajudicial and summary execution.</p>

<p>For most people in the world little will have changed. The ongoing wanton disregard for international law that has characterized American foreign policy for some time will remain the greatest threat to their security. For the majority of the three billion people living in poverty around the world the US has shown once again that the mainly Western-written rules of international law mean nothing when they are intended to protect the less-powerful.</p>

<p>While powerful Western leaders have slaughtered millions of Iraqis and Afghanis with impunity; while Israel continues to carry out genocide against the Palestinians in full view of the world; while NATO continues to bomb the people of Libya irrespective of the UN Charter; the West is now celebrating the death of someone who, however misled and wrong-minded, was a person who was willing to fight for the poorest and the most vulnerable people in the world to the very end of his life. That the US had to kill him in violation of international law lends credibility to Osama Bin Laden's claims of Western hypocrisy and the need for a better alternative.</p>

A lawful military target during a time of armed conflict, Bin Laden was apparently disposed of within the parameters of those laws that govern armed conflict.</p>

<p>The laws of armed conflict in general govern the methods and means of warfare and protect those persons found on the battlefield.  These laws were codified in various international treaties, to include the Hague Rules of 1907, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Protocols Additional of 1977.  Within these laws, which codified centuries of custom and courtesies of war, there are procedures to care for and dispose of the dead found on the battlefield.</p>

<p>What were the obligations of United States Special Operations Forces related to the body of Osama Bin Laden?  The first obligation was not to defile, rob, or desecrate the body.  Secondly, the body was to be identified, personal affects collected and inventoried and then, thirdly the body disposed of appropriately as the circumstances dictate following religious customs.</p>

<p>The facts show that after Bin Laden was tentatively identified, he was taken via helicopter out of Pakistan, identified/photographed in Afghanistan, and then his body was transferred to a military vessel, the body prepared for burial according to Islamic tradition, and then buried at sea.  Apparently the burial was videotaped. End of story?</p>

<p>Alas it is not the end of the story.  The United States has complied with the law; yet public concern, skepticism, and interest over whether it was truly Bin Laden are putting pressure on the Obama administration to release photographs of the body to the public. </p>

<p>My advice would be not to do so as the laws of armed conflict generally preclude such action.  The general rule is that prisoners of war, detainees, and the dead are to be treated humanely, not ridiculed, defiled, or made examples of during their incarceration/disposal.</p>

<p>Releasing a picture of a deceased Bin Laden, particularly since the face was badly damaged in the fire fight, would only inflame his emotional and distraught supporters, even harden their resolve to fight on.  Bin Laden's greatest weapon was the media. Releasing those photographs could give him one more minor victory.</p>

<p>Bin Laden has been legally disposed of in a lawful military operation.  Let's not end the event with a questionable act, regardless of the political and public pressure to do so by showing sensational photographs of Bin Laden's corpse. Show the identification photos to those who have an official need to know and move forward taking the fight to the rest of the leadership of this international criminal organization.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=amos-guiora">Amos N. Guiora</a> of the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah says that although the killing of Osama Bin Laden was a legitimate military action, it is important to consider the implications of his death for counterterrorism efforts...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/Guiora.jpg" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>P</b></font>resident Obama's decision to target Osama Bin Laden was unequivocally the right call. The operation was planned and implemented flawlessly and the American people owe an enormous debt of gratitude to those who painstakingly&#8212;and anonymously&#8212;track and trace endless pieces of intelligence information. Although challenging, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless, connecting the innumerable dots is essential to effective operational counterterrorism. The reality of intelligence gathering is that finding someone can take years, particularly in extraordinarily complicated situations and locations.  The Navy Seals who carried out the attack should also be commended for their extraordinary performance. Indeed, the phrase "on behalf of a grateful nation" is truly apt.</p>

<p>Since President Obama's dramatic press conference, I have had the privilege of fielding innumerable media requests. Interestingly, in a departure from responses to past incidents, the questions have focused on the geostrategic and operational issues rather than on the legality of the hit.  In the aftermath of previous attacks on terrorists and suspected terrorists, the debate focused primarily on the legal parameters of self-defense and when an individual is a legitimate target of attack.  Such issues have not been the focal point here; rather Bin Laden's death has sparked enormously significant questions about the future of al-Qaeda, the future face of terrorism and the possibility of attacks in the days to come.  Indeed, this impressive tactical success does not eliminate&#8212;in fact emphasizes&#8212;the need for sober and cautious reflection.</p>

<p>The legality of the operation should not be lost amid the significance of the geostrategic issues.  After all, effective operational counterterrorism must be legal; that is the essence of the rule of law, regardless of the paradigm's complexity. That imperative was my advice to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commanders when I served as a Legal Advisor in the IDF and it has driven my scholarship in the past seven years.</p>

<p>According to the principles of self-defense enshrined in the UN Charter, the nation-state has a right to protect itself when attacked.  Notwithstanding important questions regarding the limits and legality of pre-emptive self-defense, Bin Laden's continued threats and his proven ability to successfully conduct attacks&#8212;9/11 in particular&#8212;unequivocally categorized him as a legitimate target at the time he was killed.  The attack, therefore, was not an act of retribution under international law.  It also adhered to fundamental international law principles, including distinction, military necessity, proportionality and alternatives.  As a result, the operation was the manifestation of lawful and legitimate self-defense.</p>

<p>More important, beyond the legal issues, we cannot allow the operation's success to gloss over important questions that also deserve our attention.  The key question: "where do we go from here?"  Although killing Bin Laden is a significant tactical victory, it does not mean defeat for terrorism or terrorists, unlike V-E and V-J Day. Perhaps, in fact, quite the opposite. </p>

<p>After all, the Hamas mastermind responsible for killing over 200 Israelis, Yihah A'yash, was killed in January 1996 in a sophisticated operation that penetrated his inner circle. A brutal series of suicide bombings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Ashkelon, killing scores of Israelis soon followed; in May of that year, Prime Minister Peres was stunningly upset by Benjamin Netanyahu. This example dramatically highlights the retribution motif of a terrorist organization that has been significantly attacked. Under such circumstances, the new leader's need to quickly prove his worth to multiple publics (his and ours, at the least) is a powerful motivation.</p>

<p>In addition, terrorist attacks over the past seven years suggest that the "global jihadism" threat was over-stated and exaggerated. After all, the Madrid train bombings, the London subway bombings, the plot to blow up 13 US bound planes, the failed Times Square bombing, the attack on a Beslan schoolhouse and the Fort Hood massacre were all committed by citizens or residents of Spain, Russia, the UK and the US. The attacks reflect a domestic terrorism in which the terrorists were radicalized to act in the name of religious extremism for the most part by local religious extremist faith leaders.</p>

<p>The question, then, is whether Bin Laden had become more a symbol rather than the operational brains behind al-Qaeda over recent years. That does not suggest the action was illegal; not at all. He remained a legitimate target and a credible threat to the US. However, there is a potential <em>future</em> cost to the action. We must ask whether turning Bin Laden into a martyr and inviting the all but inevitable retributive attacks was the right decision from a strategic perspective.</p>

<p>One final note: the celebrations that greeted President Obama's announcement were, for me, a moment to "cringe."   A person's death, even the death of a bitter enemy, is not cause for celebration.  As one family member who lost a loved one on 9/11 soberly noted, "I would prefer killing the idea, not the man."  It is noteworthy to recall that Americans were aghast at scenes of "dancing on the rooftops" after 9/11.  Bin Laden was responsible for horrific terrorist attacks but his death does not mark the death of al-Qaeda or the death of terrorism.  One can therefore hope that on the morning after, revelers also understand a cold reality: terrorism is here to stay.</p>

The highest-ranking officer, General Gratien Kabiligi, was acquitted of all charges in the December 2008 Trial Judgment. Ntabakuze and other defendants (even the notorious Bagosora) were also acquitted of conspiracy or planning to commit genocide. The Prosecutor did not appeal the acquittals.</p>

<p>In the interest of full disclosure, as reported in the <em>New York Times</em> April 28, 2011, I was Ntabakuze's lead counsel until the ICTR Appeal Chamber informed me on April 21 that my request to appear by video for the four-hour hearing was "unprofessional conduct." This decision came after threats on my life by Rwandan President Paul Kagame and unbidden PTSD symptoms following my release from imprisonment for medical reasons by Kagame's government last summer. My release came only after appeals by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and an international campaign. On April 30, the Appeal Chamber appointed co-counsel Andre Tremblay, who had been unable to appear on March 31 for medical reasons, as my replacement to argue the appeal in Arusha as we suggested before I was removed.</p>

<p>On January 27, the Appeal Chamber first announced the date for the hearing. This was the same day the Chamber denied Ntabakuze's Motion for the Permanent Stay of the Proceedings filed on December 17, 2010. Tremblay and I informed the Chamber of the conflict of interest situation, created when the Rwandan government arrested me last summer and threatened me with life in prison for the "crime" of writing articles in my office in the US describing Military-1 Trial evidence that challenged the one-sided story of the war.</p>

<p>The motion informed the Appeal Chamber that, after I was released, the threats to my life and safety did not stop, the Appeal Chamber was provided with:<ul><li>An email from a former Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) leader reporting a high level meeting in October 2010 during which Kagame told senior leaders that my release was a "mistake" and I should be returned to Kigali "dead or alive";</li><li>Notice that, by failing to extend UN immunity to writings about the Military-1 case beyond proceedings in court, the Appeal Chamber exposed all lawyers to prosecution because of Rwanda's universal jurisdiction claims over words written or spoken anywhere in the world;</li><li>RPF officials continued to insist that I would be prosecuted, and if I did not return to Kigali, INTERPOL warrants would be issued for my arrest;</li><li>Rwanda claimed all defense lawyers were "genocide deniers" engaged in a vast conspiracy, evidenced by conferences organized by defense counsel in Europe;</li><li>UN "functional immunity" was not meaningful protection from RPF extrajudicial assassinations and disappearances, as confirmed by asylum claims of opponents and former supporters of the Kagame regime as well as mass violence in the Kibeho massacre, invasions of the Congo, etc.;</li><li>Fear of extrajudicial violence was not abstract as evidenced by the murder of Professor Jwani Mwaikusa, ICTR defense counsel, in Dar es Salaam in July 2010; the attempted assassination of Kagame's former chief of staff in South Africa in June 2010; the beheading of the Green Party vice president in Rwanda in July 2010; the assassination of an opposition journalist in Kigali in July 2010;</li><li>Evidence that the stated reason for my arrest, "genocide denial," was discredited by the UN "Mapping Report" on October 1, 2010, documenting RPF genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Congo from 1993-2003;</li><li>Evidence of a cover-up at the ICTR trial level, confirmed in the 2009 memoirs of former ICTR Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte;</li><li>ICTR prosecutors' affidavits that confirm the ICTR knew of Kagame's responsibility for the assassinations of presidents Habyarimana and Ntaryarmira, touching off the genocide in 1997, and the Spanish indictment of Judge Abreu Merelles, which describes 325,000 people killed by the RPF in 1994;</li><li>The Military-1 Judgment in December 2008, acquitting the top military officers of conspiracy to commit genocide, contains UN files that show UN General Dallaire concluded that the RPF refused to use its military superiority to stop mass killings as part of its war plan.</li></ul></p>

<p>The motion alleged that this evidence, and more, made normal representation in Arusha impossible because RPF supporters and agents work at the ICTR and are present throughout east Africa. None of this evidence had ever been put before the Appeal Chamber before, although the Chamber must have known that the ICTR, with a mandate to prosecute all crimes, has only prosecuted only the vanquished.</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> article was too short to review the litigation leading up to the April 21 Order, but the following is reflected in the Military-1 litigation record. As early as December 17, 2010, the Appeal Chamber was on notice that threats to my life and safety made normal professional focus on my client's interests in Arusha illusory, at best:<ul><li>December 17, 2010 &#8212; Motion for Stay of Proceedings/Conflict of Interest because of threats to<br />
defense counsel;<li>January 27, 2011 &#8212; Motion for State of Proceedings denied, first notice of oral argument 60 days hence &#8212; March 31/April 1 (4 hours total);<li>February 1, 2011 &#8212; Co-counsel Tremblay requested ICTR Registrar for withdrawal for conflict of interest reasons. Waiver of conflict by client permits lead counsel to continue;<li>February 7, 2011 &#8212; Formal Request for Substitution of Co-counsel;<li>February 13, 2011 &#8212; Tremblay suffered injuries in a road accident. A British barrister, qualified to practice at both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and ICTR, engaged to replace Tremblay pending response from Registrar;<li>February 22, 2011 &#8212; No response from Registrar, Motion for Video Appearance by Counsel filed;<li>February 24, 2011 &#8212; Registrar Decision Denies Substitution of Co-counsel, rejected conflict of interest, ignored medical unavailability of co-counsel;<li>March 4, 2011 &#8212; Addendum to Request of Video re: medical condition of co-counsel;<li>March 15, 2011 &#8212; Motion for Video Appearance denied by Appeal Chamber;<li>March 25, 2011 &#8212; Confidential Medical Report Notice of Waiver of Appearance of Counsel by Defendant: Notification of onset of increasingly acute symptoms of PTSD as travel/hearing date of draws closer, Defendant waives presence of counsel;<li>March 31, 2011 &#8212; Waiver of Presence of Counsel by Ntabakuze: Public record of PTSD diagnosis resulting from Rwandan imprisonment and intense reactions brought on by impending life threatening situation;<li>April 15, 2011 &#8212; Counsel and co-counsel inform Chamber that counsel, pending medical approval, can complete 4-hour hearing by video or at The Hague after May 1 and co-counsel in Arusha, after June 1;<li>April 21, 2011 &#8212; Chamber Order removing counsel;<li>April 30, 2011 &#8212; Registrar Order replacing counsel with co-counsel Tremblay.</ul></p>

<p>The Chamber was also informed that ambassadors and agents of the Rwandan government had attempted to disrupt my academic speaking engagements at US law schools in New York, D.C., Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The Chamber was provided with copies of the propaganda churned out by the Rwanda media calling for my arrest and worse. Ntabakuze's concern for my life and safety was embodied in the March 31 Waiver of the Presence of Counsel that also explained PTSD symptoms but failed to convince the Appeal Chamber.</p>

<p>Now that I have been replaced, the final four-hour argument will be scheduled for some time after June 1 in Arusha as originally suggested. Ntabakuze will still benefit from the extraordinary efforts of Tremblay and Legal Assistants Me. Sandrine Gaillot and Joseph Holmes, Esq., who were prepared to assist during the March 31 hearing had the Appeal Chamber permitted him to proceed with the argument as requested.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important evidence in the many documents now before the Appeals Chamber for the first time is the evidence of RPF crimes that the ICTR failed to prosecute which was provided by former ICTR prosecutors Carla Del Ponte, Florence Hartmann, and Michael Hourigan, FBI Agent James Lyons, and UNAMIR's Amadou Deme. All of whom were fired or resigned when they insisted on prosecuting Kagame or the RPF for crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. The first defense attorney has now been added to their ranks and the evidence of the ICTR cover-up they could not put before the Chamber is now in the record and is a bell that cannot be "unrung."</p>

<p>It is important that my colleagues have a clear understanding of what will be required of them, should they accept the mandate to defend a case in the international system. Apparently, the "highest level of professional standards" permits participating in the cover-up of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity whether as a prosecutor or a defense attorney. At its "highest levels" professional standards require counsel to risk arrest by a criminal dictatorship for thought crimes, or assassination, to assist the court in perpetuating a cover-up, should the court so decree. Unfortunately for me, ethical rules in the US prohibit knowingly participating in a fraud. I wonder how others do it?</p>

<p>In addition to all this, on May 2 Rwanda Prosecutor Martin Ngoga announced he would insist on my return to Rwanda to answer false "genocide denial" charges. So, permit me to make clear: (1) I have never disputed the evidence that tens of thousands of Rwandan Tutsis were killed in Rwanda in 1994, under conditions that meet the definition of the Genocide Convention; (2) I have never disputed the UN characterization of the "Rwandan genocide" as having both Hutu and Tutsi victims; (3) I have never disputed the findings of October 2010 UN "Mapping Report," that between 1993-2003 the RPF, and others, committed mass violence against both Hutu and Tutsi victims.</p>

<p>Agreeing with the UN apparently makes anyone a criminal in the eyes of Ngoga and Kagame. The Rwanda Constitution was amended two years ago to officially rename the "Rwanda genocide," the "Rwanda Genocide of Tutsis." In Kagame's Rwanda, no victims other than Tutsis need apply, no matter what the facts might be.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/laurie-blank.html">Laurie Blank</a> of Emory University School of Law argues that any investigation into the killing of Osama Bin Laden must critically assess whether to apply the international law of armed conflict or human rights law in order to be effective...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/laurieblank.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>F</b></font>ive days after the US raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in his walled hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, UN special rapporteurs on summary executions and on human rights and counter-terrorism are calling for the US to disclose whether the Navy Seals offered Bin Laden "any meaningful prospect of surrender and arrest." The special rapporteurs are requesting this information in order to "allow an assessment in terms of international human rights law standards."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that investigations and assessments are critical tools to ensure that military operations and other uses of force adhere to the law&#8212;for the protection of innocent civilians in the area, the protection of those engaged in combat, the preservation of protected objects and sites, and for the maintenance of effective and disciplined operations. Police operations depend on post-hoc investigations as well, to ensure the appropriate and measured application of authority and&#8212;where relevant&#8212;deadly force.</p>

<p>But before we engage in an investigation and examination of the "rightness" or "wrongness" of the Bin Laden raid or any other operation, setting the parameters of the legal paradigm&#8212;how to determine the lines between right and wrong&#8212;is the essential first task.</p>

<p>During armed conflict, whether international or non-international, the law of armed conflict applies and governs the conduct of hostilities and the protection of persons and objects. The special rapporteurs' statement clearly demonstrates that in his view, and the basis for his proposed investigation, is that armed conflict is not the relevant paradigm for examining Bin Laden operation. Instead, the reference to human rights standards highlights the law enforcement paradigm.</p>

<p>The casual observer may think that whether we apply the law of war or human rights law is an academic question, one that does not really impact whether the operation was lawful. Not only is that an incorrect assumption, but the effect of the wrong choice of legal paradigm may have far-reaching consequences.</p>

<p>Investigations of military operations, both internal and external, can have significant and powerful effects on the conduct of future operations&#8212;it is axiomatic that we must examine the lawfulness of operations in order to ensure compliance with legal obligations. To do so, however, the investigations must have credibility with the very persons and institutions they purport to assess.</p>

<p>Since September 11, 2001, the US has categorized its fight against al Qaeda as an armed conflict, a framework upheld by all three branches of the US government. Is the armed conflict paradigm for state vs. terrorist group irrefutable? Not necessarily, as the continuing debate in the academic and policy worlds demonstrates. Beyond that, the armed conflict paradigm itself raises a host of interesting and important questions that bear on the conduct of military operations and the protection of persons, such as the parameters of the battlefield, the identification and status of enemy personnel and the rights they are due, and so forth.</p>

<p>To suggest, therefore, as the special rapporteurs do in their call for additional facts, that the Bin Laden operation should be investigated within a human rights framework with no regard for the question of whether that is the right framework, is not only an unreasonable assumption, but misses an opportunity to tackle some of these challenging questions. It is also a recipe for ineffectiveness and counterproductive results.</p>

<p>Under the law of armed conflict, whether Bin Laden was armed or unarmed is essentially an irrelevant question. As the leader of the enemy forces, he was a legitimate military target at all times, whether firing a weapon or brushing his teeth. The law of armed conflict includes no obligation to offer the enemy a chance to surrender&#8212;imagine how that would play out in the middle of a tank or artillery battle. The law does mandate that any operation comport with the obligations of distinction, proportionality and precautions, and based on the information currently available, the Navy Seals and those who planned the operation demonstrated great respect for these obligations.</p>

<p>Further exploration of how the operation met these legal obligations would be relevant and useful for the planning and implementation of future operations. We will not get that value, however, from an investigation blindly applying human rights standards. First, any such investigation will likely be ignored and discredited by the US, emasculating and rendering any findings largely irrelevant. Second, such an investigation can actually have negative effects through the importation of inappropriate standards into the law, leading to a rejection of the law as unreasonable. Interpreting the law to require warning shots before using deadly force against enemy fighters during armed conflict is not only wrong but dangerous for our soldiers on the ground. Requiring an invitation to surrender before using lethal force against legitimate targets during armed conflict will be equally dangerous.</p>

<p>When the law of armed conflict mandates the use of deadly force as a first resort and human rights law prohibits the use of deadly force except as a last resort, we can see that the two paradigms will often be irreconcilable when applied to the same incident. And yet both legal regimes have the protection of persons as a core value.</p>

<p>The broader risk therefore is that such an investigation can lead relevant persons to see the law itself as the problem, not the particular legal analysis at issue. And that places both innocent civilians and those who are fighting in the greatest danger of all. The choice of applicable law, therefore, must be neither cavalier nor determined solely by perspective or politics. If it is, the investigation will not be worth the paper on which it is written.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.syr.edu/deans-faculty-staff/profile.aspx?fac=152">David Crane</a> of Syracuse University College of Law says there is a fairly simple formula to determine the legality of the military operation that killed Osama Bin Laden... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/davidcranenew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>o assist in the important debate related to the targeting of Osama Bin Laden, I offer up a formula to assist in this important debate related to that targeting.  Though simplistic, and in acknowledgement of valid concerns legally and practically related to the targeting, this formula helps clear an intellectual path to a conclusion that perhaps his targeting was lawful.</p>

<p>The death of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan was a lawful military operation. It is a matter of (A) + (B) = (C). When a nation contemplates the use of force, that force must be done with legal authority (A) and within the strictures of the laws of armed conflict (B). If there is both legal authority and that force follows the principles laid down by The Hague Rules of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions of 1949 then there can be a justified result (C). </p>

<p>Let's break down the formula further using the facts that are apparent in the killing of Bin Laden. In the early morning hours of May 2nd (Pakistan time), United States Special Operations Forces dynamically entered the compound where Bin Laden, some members of his family, and others lived.  Let's consider (A) the legal authority. After September 11, 2001, Congress authorized the Commander-in-Chief at the time to use force against those individuals who had perpetrated the attack on the United States that fateful day. Under our constitutional scheme, the President could direct the National Command Authority to use armed force against Al Qaeda, including Bin Laden and others. Additional international authorizations via the United Nations and NATO followed. Overlaid in this authorization to use force was the basic international principle of the inherent right of a nation to self-defense, found in Art. 51 of the UN Charter. </p>

<p>Domestically, the authorized use of force was most certainly buttressed by a Presidential finding to kill Bin Laden as a hostile. By law the President must inform the leadership in Congress about these findings. This apparently was done years ago.</p>

<p>Thus President Obama had the legal authority to order Operation Geronimo and to executive the plan. The (A) part of the formula is complete. However in order to have a justified result (C) there must be the comporting of that use of force with the laws of armed conflict (B). Was Operation Geronimo conducted within the parameters of the rules of war?</p>

<p>When the Special Forces entered the compound they had to use the force authorized by following certain principles: military necessity, proportionality, and distinction/discrimination.  Bin Laden had been declared a hostile target and as such there was a militarily necessary reason to engage him, an act to further the military objectives of the international community and the United States against Al Qaeda, the Taliban and global terrorism. If there is no militarily necessary reason to engage a target then engaging it is illegal. There was a military necessary reason to engage Bin Laden; hence the principle of military necessity was satisfied.</p>

<p>When the Special Operation Forces entered Bin Laden's bedroom the force that they used was proportional to the threat proffered by those in that room. Bin Laden apparently showed no sign of surrendering and there were weapons close by him. The use of assigned small arms to engage the lawful target was a proportional response to the threat Bin Laden posed to the Special Forces. The principle of proportionality was thus satisfied.</p>

<p>A final relevant principle related to the use of force in the operation was that of distinction/discrimination. When force is used, the force must be discriminate with the target distinctly engaged. What does this mean? Those who use that force must aim at the target they intend to engage ensuring no one that is protected under the law of armed conflict, e.g. civilians, are hit. The intentional targeting of civilians is never authorized except in self-defense. Unintentional injury or death of civilians in a military operation is called collateral damage and, though unfortunate, not a violation of law. Here the use of force in Bin Laden's room was very discriminate, two well-aimed shots once in the chest and head of the military target, Bin Laden.  The principle of distinction and discrimination was satisfied.  The alleged shooting of a wife of Bin Laden appears to have been in self-defense according to the facts given by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Other persons in the compound were either protected, such as the children, or those who offered resistance or who fired on the Special Forces also were properly engaged as hostile at a minimum under the principle of self-defense. It appears that no civilians were intentionally targeted. Thus the essential (B) part of the equation was satisfied.  </p>

<p>Since (A) legal authority and (B) adhering to the laws of armed conflict were in place, the killing of Bin Laden, and those who engaged the Special Forces to protect him were justified killings under our domestic law as well as international law (C). The killing of human beings is never to be lightly taken and when it is done it must be done lawfully. The death of Bin Laden was lawful. It was a matter of (A) + (B) = (C) as well as a great deal of courage by our armed forces.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://web.law.und.edu/LawFaculty/Profile/gordon.php">Gregory Gordon</a> of the University of North Dakota School of Law says that in light of the case of Joshua arap Sang, and for purposes of educating the public and deterring future would-be perpetrators, we need a more accurate understanding of the rapidly evolving area of international speech crime law... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/gregorygordon.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font>n article posted this week on <em>The Atlantic</em> website regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC) case against Kenyan radio announcer Joshua arap Sang raises some important issues related to international speech crime law, but also creates much confusion. Arap Sang is <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-accuses-6-kenyans-of-orchestrating-2007-post-election-violence.php">accused of committing crimes against humanity</a> in part through broadcasting messages urging violence against certain Kenyan ethnic groups following the controversial 2007 presidential election. Unfortunately, in describing this case, <em>The Atlantic</em> article, "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/kenyan-trial-asks-can-journalism-be-a-war-crime/238692/">Kenyan Trial Asks, Can Journalism Be a War Crime</a>," confuses incitement to commit genocide with persecution&#8212;a crime against humanity under international law&#8212;erroneously indicating that arap Sang is being accused of the former. And the article gives a partially inaccurate historical account of the verdict against Nazi journalist Julius Streicher at Nuremberg. As international speech crime law is at a critical juncture in its relatively short history, I believe some clarification is in order.</p>

<p><em>The Atlantic</em> article is like other press accounts of international speech crime cases in which journalists understandably raise the specter of illegitimate suppression while trying to parse a complex body of law, forged primarily through cases decided at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). With recent speech crime allegations being leveled against embattled leaders in Libya and the Ivory Coast, as well as a recent South African high court judgment finding that controversial politician Julius Malema committed incitement to murder for singing "Shoot the Boer" at rallies, it is important to set the record straight regarding the case against arap Sang and the current state of international speech crime law.</p>

<p>Most of the problems in the article stem from confusing two different crimes&#8212;direct and public incitement to commit genocide and persecution. The crime of direct and public incitement to commit genocide was first formulated in the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html">1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</a>. This inchoate offense arises uniquely in the context of genocide&#8212;in other words certain acts (most prominently killing) performed with the intent to eliminate, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group, as such.  Given its inchoate nature (like attempt or solicitation), incitement gives rise to criminal liability even if the target offense is not consummated. Thus, resultant violence is not a necessary element. With respect to Streicher, given that he was convicted in 1946 before adoption of the Genocide Convention, <em>The Atlantic</em> is wrong in stating that he was found "guilty of incitement." In fact, he was found guilty of crimes against humanity&#8212;persecution on political and racial grounds (although, in fairness, the Nuremberg Tribunal stated Streicher committed his crimes by "inciting to murder and extermination").</p>

<p>Crimes against humanity, for its part, is different from incitement to commit genocide. Crimes against humanity consists of certain acts (including persecution) committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population. The ICTR has held that, in certain contexts, hate speech can constitute the crime against humanity of persecution. Although a trial chamber for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has taken the opposite position.</p>

<p>Interestingly, although arap Sang is accused by the ICC of crimes against humanity (persecution on political grounds), the persecution alleged does not stem directly from radio hate speech targeting ethnic minorities. Rather, the persecution is based on acts of murder and forcible transfer of population perpetrated against civilians on the basis of their political beliefs. The hate speech is implicated only indirectly&#8212;as part of various acts in support of a joint criminal enterprise between arap Sang and two co-defendants to commit the murders and deportations. So the potential free speech concerns should not be as direct as they would be if hate speech itself, qua hate speech, were the sole basis of the charge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, <em>The Atlantic</em> article inaccurately suggests that arap Sang is facing possible incitement to commit genocide charges. In fact, there are no allegations of genocide connected to the Kenyan post-election violence. <em>A fortiori</em> incitement to commit genocide is not at issue. Nevertheless, citing an ICTR holding on incitement to commit genocide, not crimes against humanity, the article erroneously concludes that arap Sang could be convicted even if his radio broadcasts are not causally linked to the Kenyan post-election violence. As just noted, since arap Sang is not even charged with incitement, this analysis is sloppy at best, and misleading at worst (as is the title's suggestion he is currently on trial&#8212;a hearing to confirm proposed charges is set for September). The analysis is especially problematic, given that arap Sang's broadcasts are not in and of themselves the basis of any criminal charges against him; they are only used in support of non-speech-related charges (murder and forcible transfer of population as part of a joint criminal enterprise with other defendants).</p>

<p>International speech crime law is still evolving and perhaps has yet to strike the ideal balance between properly protecting legitimate free speech and effectively preventing and punishing illicit violence advocacy. But it has made great strides. As the likes of arap Sang and Muammar Gaddafi face the prospect of justice in The Hague, for purposes of educating the public and deterring future would-be perpetrators, we need an accurate understanding of this rapidly evolving area of law. The press has its own challenges and biases in covering stories related to speech crime cases, which often appear simple on the surface but can be quite complex from a legal perspective. So it must do its homework. Of course, at the same time, we should not ignore the potential chilling effects of criminal speech cases, especially when journalists are involved. Let us hope that going forward such cases can be reported more accurately. Stoking public fears of judicial overreaching in the area of freedom of expression may sell more papers but it is not in our best interests.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> of the University of Houston Law Center says that the War Powers Resolution does not limit the president's options in Libya due to his constitutional authority and international obligations... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jpaust.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>P</b></font>resident Obama has decided that the US will continue to participate with other NATO members in military actions authorized by the UN Security Council in <a href="http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">Resolution 1973</a> (March 17, 2011), which "[a]uthorizes Member States ... to take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in" Libya. The Security Council has authority to authorize such measures under Articles 39 and 42 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> in response to "any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression."  </p>

<p>In this instance, the Council has decided that attacks on and continued threats to civilians and civilian populated areas in Libya "continue to constitute a threat to international peace and security" and the Council has decided to authorize all such protective measures, including the creation of a no-fly zone.  The Security Council's decision to authorize force is therefore binding on members under Articles 25 and 48 of the Charter, but because it merely authorizes force and does not require members to engage in such enforcement measures, each member has some discretion whether to join.</p>

<p>Although the US use of force in compliance with the Security Council resolution is permissible under international law, is President Obama's continued use of force also permissible under our Constitution without special congressional approval?  In my view, the answer is clearly yes.</p>

<p>Some have argued that US participation after 90 days violates the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/warpower.asp">War Powers Resolution</a>, but even a quick read of the congressional resolution demonstrates that this is not correct.  First, one should note that Section 2(c) of the Resolution (setting forth its "Purpose and Policy") merely speaks to the powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief and does not address the constitutionally-based powers of the President as the Executive under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section1">Article II, Section 1</a>, of the Constitution.  Additionally, it does not address the constitutionally-based duty and concomitant authority of the President under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section3">Article II, Section 3</a>, to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."  As the Executive with power and authority to execute laws, and especially with the unavoidable mandate that the President "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," and given the fact that treaties of the United States (such as the UN Charter) are supreme federal laws, it is evident that the President has constitutionally-based authority to faithfully execute US competencies under the Charter outside of the President's independent authority as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>In any event, the War Powers Resolution contains its own set of limitations.  One of these is found in Section 8(b), which allows members of the armed forces of the United States "to participate jointly with members of the armed forces of one or more foreign countries in the headquarters operations of high-level military commands which were established" previously "and pursuant to the United Nations Charter or any treaty ratified by the United States prior to" the War Powers Resolution.  NATO is a relevant treaty-based organization, although whether its "high-level military" command was previously established for purposes of the statute or, for interpretive purposes, is merely established for each specific operation may lead to disagreement.</p>

<p>Another set of limitations is contained in Section 8(d)(1), which assures in pertinent part that "[n]othing in this joint resolution is intended to alter the constitutional authority of ... the President, or the provisions of existing treaties."  As mentioned, the President's authority involves the Executive power as well as the concomitant duty and authority faithfully to execute the laws, such as treaties of the United States.  Execute is nearly the very name of Executive and, in any event, execute is encompassed within its meaning.  The War Powers Resolution was not meant to alter these forms of constitutional authority and, as constitutionally-based presidential power, a mere federal statute or joint resolution could not do so.  </p>

<p>Moreover, the War Powers Resolution is expressly intended to not alter the provisions of existing treaties and, therefore, it was not intended to alter provisions of the UN Charter or the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm">North Atlantic Treaty</a> establishing NATO.  With respect to treaty law, in this instance the President has chosen on behalf of the United States to accept and execute the authorization contained in the UN Security Council resolution and engage in enforcement measures with respect to Libya.  In so doing, the President has faithfully executed provisions of the UN Charter, including an outcome of that treaty's continued functioning (e.g., the Security Council resolution and its legal authorization which are also last in time vis-a-vis the War Powers Resolution, constituting prevailing law).  Faithfully executing the treaty is part of the President's constitutionally unavoidable duty expressed in mandatory "shall" language and, more generally, this duty involving compliance with and faithful execution of a treaty of the United States happened to be of fundamental concern to the Founders and Framers.</p>

		<title>The Societal and Economic Impact of Transgender Discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward SanFilippo, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2013, was recently a panelist at <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/events/2011/04/transgender-experiences-a-legal-perspective">Transgender Experiences: A Legal Perspective</a>, and writes here about legal issues confronting transgendered Americans. He argues that legalized discrimination is morally and economically indefensible... <hr height="1"><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he <a href="http://www3.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/home.html">Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law</a> recently published two studies pertaining to the transgender community. The first, titled "<a href="http://www3.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/pdf/How-many-people-are-LGBT-Final.pdf">How many people are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender?</a>" [PDF] and authored by Gary Gates, estimated the transgender population at approximately 0.3% of the total American population, or a little less than 700,000 people (other studies have estimated the population at twice this amount, but in either case the number remains significantly low). In pure <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html">numbers</a>, this puts the transgender population somewhere between the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community and the American Indian community. Discrimination and violence against transgender individuals in nearly every facet of their lives remains rampant, despite these small numbers.</p>

<p>The second study, authored by Jody L. Herman and entitled "<a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/news/ma-trans-employment-discrimination.pdf">The Cost of Employment Discrimination against Transgender Residents of Massachusetts</a>," [PDF] found that discrimination against the state's approximately 33,000 transgender residents costs the state millions of dollars each year. According to the study, "[n]ot only does the Commonwealth suffer lost income tax revenue because of discrimination, but each transgender person who loses a job may become eligible for programs that will cost the state hundreds or thousands of dollars." These programs include housing assistance, work-related programs, and public-assistance expenditures to replace lost income and insurance coverage. </p>

<p>The problem is not unique to Massachusetts, which protects only public employees from discrimination on the basis of their gender identity. Twelve states protect transgender workers from discrimination, but that still leaves individuals unprotected in most of the country. Even states with protections are not immune from the problem. Earlier this year, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court in Camden, New Jersey, in which a transgender male alleged discrimination after he was fired from his job. New Jersey law prohibits discrimination against an individual's transgender status. The plaintiff's former employer claimed in its January filing that the firing was legitimate, "since the sex of the employee engaged in that particular job position is a bona fide occupational qualification." Having a gender requirement for the position, which involves monitoring men as they give urine samples for drug tests, is a concededly appropriate exercise of an employer's limited discretion to delegate particular jobs on the basis of gender.  The question, though, is whether an employer can legally assert the gender of an employee, particularly one who has legally completed a transition from one gender to the other. </p>

<p>One would hope the answer to such a question is not in the affirmative, but legal precedent is less than encouraging. The 1999 Texas case of <a href="http://www.4thcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/HTMLOpinion.asp?OpinionID=8210">Littleton v. Prange</a> is a telling example. The appellant, a transgender woman named Christie Lee Littleton, filed a wrongful death malpractice suit after the death of her husband. The appellee doctor filed for summary judgment, challenging "Christie's status as a proper wrongful death beneficiary," and "asserting that Christie is a man and cannot be the surviving spouse of another man." Littleton had undergone full sex reassignment surgery and changed all of her relevant legal documents to be recognized as female prior to her marriage. Her surgeons testified that she was both physically and medically female, but the court granted the doctor summary judgment. </p>

<p>In affirming the decision of the lower court, the appellate court subsequently invalidated her revision to her birth certificate, as well as her Kentucky marriage license, ruling: "We hold, as a matter of law, that Christie Littleton is a male. As a male, Christie cannot be married to another male. Her marriage to Jonathon was invalid, and she cannot bring a cause of action as his surviving spouse." <em>Littleton</em> was cited last week in another Texas case, <em>Delgado v. Araguz</em>. In this case, the transgender widow of a firefighter killed in the line of duty had her marriage nullified and her inheritance diverted to the decedent's family, as the family had intended when they filed the action. The problem extends beyond the judiciary (and Texas)&#8212;several states are currently pushing legislation that would prohibit transgender individuals from marrying anyone at all. While the costs to the individuals facing discrimination in these situations is obvious, the less apparent costs are to the unnecessarily overburdened judiciary, a legislature debating pointless laws, and in the end, the taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for both.  </p>

<p>So far this discussion has centered only on issues pertaining to employment and marriage law, but the problem is much larger. The <a href="http://transequality.org/PDFs/Executive_Summary.pdf">National Transgender Discrimination Survey</a> [PDF] found that transgender people also face discrimination in housing, healthcare, and education, to name a few areas. Discrimination this pervasive comes at a tremendous cost not only to the individuals facing it, but also to society as a whole. The cost to the transgender community is tremendous and well documented, but what of those broader societal costs? If employment discrimination against transgender people costs Massachusetts $3,000,000 each year just for medically related expenditures, as Herman"s figures suggest, how much greater are these costs when the other forms of discrimination are included? How much greater when other related state expenditures are added? </p>

<p>Beyond Massachusetts, how great are these costs among the states nationwide? What about the costs on a federal level, when federal services are computed? At a time when the economy is struggling and many are calling for drastic cuts in government spending, does it make fiscal or social sense to continue such blatant and pointless discrimination? What benefits justify such a cost? Whether you support the transgender community or not, discrimination hurts all of us, from those being mistreated to those bearing the burden of the societal costs. There is no justification for its continuance. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about-us/staff/gabor-rona/">Gabor Rona</a> of Human Rights First says that the recent visit to the US by German Chancellor Angela Merkel highlights a fundamental difference between the US and Europe in the interpretation and application of international law in the war on terror... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/gaborrona.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>G</b></font>ermany and the United States see eye to eye on a lot. And so, German leader Angela Merkel got a 19 gun salute and what amounts to a state dinner last week (it is not called a state dinner because she is technically not the head of state, and therefore two guns shy of 21) even though her government refuses to share intelligence with the United States to conduct drone strikes in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Why is this fly in the ointment? It is not that Germany opposes the war. Merkel has, in fact, committed thousands of troops to Afghanistan. It is that Germany has doubts about the drone program's compliance with international law.<br />
 <br />
Publicly at least, the Obama administration expresses no such doubts, of course. So what causes the two strongest of allies see things so differently?<br />
 <br />
For one thing, the two countries have different visions of the purposes of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a>. In the European collective memory, war is as much a scourge on civilians as on combatants. For Americans, war happens elsewhere to US combatants, not to US civilians, the last major war fought on US soil having been a century and a half ago. In Europe, human rights and "humanitarian law" (as the laws of armed conflict are known there) are part of a broader school curriculum, as the Geneva Conventions require. In the US, the "laws of war" (as they are known there) are more exclusively the province of the military and you are lucky to find it taught in law school, let alone high school.<br />
 <br />
The two countries also differ greatly on enforcement of international human rights obligations. The main European human rights treaty, the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, is enforced by an independent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=echr">court</a>. The main human rights treaty to which the US is a party, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, has no enforcement mechanism applicable to the US. Meanwhile, American courts typically refuse to enforce the Geneva Conventions and human rights law.<br />
 <br />
In Europe, human rights law is understood to apply in war time, although subject to the laws of armed conflict. Not so much in the US.<br />
 <br />
In Europe, human rights law is understood to apply to a state's conduct beyond its own borders. Not at all in the US.<br />
 <br />
Because the US is such an outlier, countries with robust human rights protection mechanisms must tread carefully in their dealings with their indispensable ally, for fear of violating their own legal obligations.<br />
 <br />
It is not just Europe. Last month, a Canadian appeals court refused to extradite an indicted terrorist suspect to the US because he had been tortured in detention in Pakistan, with US complicity.<br />
 <br />
Part of the reason other countries may balk at sending suspects to the US is the fear that they will end up in indefinite detention in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=title%3Aguantanamo">Guantanamo</a> or tried by its kangaroo court military commission system, rather than in the traditional federal courts. This is not idle speculation. Congress is now debating a law to prohibit federal court trials and to require Guantanamo detention and military commission trials for terrorism suspects.<br />
 <br />
In Afghanistan, NATO forces fighting alongside US forces stopped turning al Qaeda and Taliban suspects over to the Americans after news broke in 2004 of torture at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Obviously, not even US coalition partners believed the "few bad apples" meme pushed by the Bush administration. But the Obama administration has come a long way from the illegal practices of the early post-9/11 Bush administration in matters of detainee treatment. So why is the NATO policy still in place? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the US continues to detain people without providing them the right to see or challenge the evidence, let alone to have a lawyer.<br />
 <br />
The US also continues to insist on broad authority to conduct drone strikes without articulating the legal criteria it uses to determine their legitimacy. It continues to insist on broad powers to detain people without trial under questionable interpretations of the laws of war. It continues to insist on the right to transfer suspects to countries with records of detainee abuse under a veneer of "diplomatic assurances" that they will not be tortured, and without giving the detainee a right to challenge the decision. It continues to subject terrorism suspects to military trials that fail to provide the minimum judicial guarantees required by either the Geneva Conventions or by human rights law. And it continues to ignore its legal obligations to hold accountable the architects and perpetrators of US torture and to provide remedies to their victims.<br />
 <br />
Winston Churchill famously said that the US always does the right thing&#8212;after it has exhausted all the other possibilities. The globalization of terrorism means that the US cannot win this battle alone. It needs international cooperation. No reasonably astute observer thinks otherwise. But the US has been slow to connect the dots between its failures to comply with international law and the decisions of allies to withhold essential cooperation, like intelligence sharing and transfer of terrorism suspects for prosecution.<br />
 <br />
This is not about being sensitive to European sensibilities. America has different traditions and there are many issues on which it is perfectly fine to have different views and policies. This is about US counter-terrorism policies creating an obstacle to cooperation with the US, and about other countries' ability to accept cooperation from the US. It is about nothing less than a common defense against terrorism and the realization that national security will be enhanced, not diminished, by bringing US policies into compliance with international legal norms.</p>

Beyond what is evident in the video, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/12/08/sri-lanka-army-unit-linked-executions">gathered information</a> on the likely time and place of the executions, the identity of one of the victims, and the specific army unit likely to have been involved. The need for a criminal investigation is obvious, yet the Sri Lankan government has refused to conduct one, even when confronted by such disturbing footage.

                <p>In fact, the Sri Lankan government has increasingly made it clear that it does not intend to investigate this or any other allegations of wrongdoing by its forces during the decades-long conflict with the Tamil Tigers. The executions in the video are not the only alleged laws of war violations by the Sri Lankan armed forces during the war's final months. There are also numerous credible reports of indiscriminate shelling of civilians, repeated attacks on known hospitals, and the enforced disappearance of a number of captured Tamil Tiger members. </p>

                <p>Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have been killed during the last five months of the war, and justice for Sri Lanka's war victims on both sides is crucial. Instead, the government's response has been to <a href="http://www.defseminar.lk/">organize a conference</a> to tout its war efforts as a "model of counterinsurgency" and call for a "re-evaluation of the rules of military engagement" in fighting terrorist groups, presumably to allow governments to ignore longstanding laws of war in counterinsurgency operations.</p>

                <p>Justice and accountability in Sri Lanka cannot rely on the government, but depends on strong and concerted action by the international community. A UN-appointed panel of experts established to advise the Secretary General on accountability in the aftermath of the conflict concluded that the conduct of both the government and the Tamil Tigers represented a "grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during war and peace." To prevent that "grave assault" from becoming the norm, the UN and its member states need to speak out and take action. The first step should be to establish a full international investigation of the executions in the video and other numerous credible allegations of war crimes."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Connecticut law offers comprehensive protection for transgender people</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/jenniferlevi.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://pages.citebite.com/y7q8p0v0klst"><strong>Jennifer Levi</strong></a> [Director of Transgender Rights Project, <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a>]: "Recently, the Connecticut Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-passes-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.php">passed a bill</a> that adds the phrase "gender identity or expression" to all existing state sex discrimination laws. The Senate's passage followed that of the House of Representatives where the debate had been much lengthier. Governor Dannel Malloy has pledged his support for this legislation which should be signed into law any day now. Governor Malloy's signature will make Connecticut the 15th state to adopt transgender-specific provisions into its non-discrimination laws. Adoption of the legislation is a significant step forward for the transgender community which has struggled recently in getting explicit non-discrimination laws passed in no small part because of the amped up opposition to such legislation from the right.
                <p>
                    Minnesota passed the first transgender inclusive non-discrimination law in 1993 followed by Rhode Island in 2001. Between 2001 and 2007, an additional 11 states plus the District of Columbia passed comparable laws. Advocates working on similar state laws since 2007 have faced much more organized and targeted opposition as right wing groups have increasingly set their sights on opposing protections for transgender people. Their primary strategy has been to reframe the terms of the debate by shifting focus from civil rights protections to rhetoric focusing on bathroom protections. While this strategy gained some traction during the six years Connecticut considered passage of the bill, it was ultimately defeated as transgender advocates waged a legislator-by-legislator campaign to educate members about the vulnerability of transgender people throughout the state.
                <p>
                    Advocates focused on high rates of unemployment and underemployment within the transgender community. A recent <a href="http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf">survey</a> [PDF] completed by the Task Force reported that transgender individuals experience unemployment at twice the national rate. The report also found that 47 percent of participants had experienced an adverse job event, including termination, as a result of their transgender status. Those educational efforts eventually paid off as the bill was passed 77-62 in the House and 20-16 in the Senate.
                <p>
                    The definition of the term "gender identity and expression" ultimately included in the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/TOB/H/2011HB-06599-R00-HB.htm">legislation</a> bears some mention. The law will define "gender identity or expression" to mean <blockquote>a person's gender-related identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth, which gender-related identity can be shown by providing evidence including, but not limited to, medical history, care or treatment of the gender-related identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender-related identity or any other evidence that the gender-related identity is sincerely held, part of a person's core identity or not being asserted for an improper purpose.</blockquote>The definition was introduced as a House floor amendment with little debate or discussion about its purpose. Notably, it offers different and non-exclusive methods by which a person in the protected class can establish their gender identity including medically and non-medically based sources. The language intends to capture the various ways in which a gender-related identity may be demonstrated to be "sincerely held, part of a person's core identity or not being asserted for an improper purpose." The term "or" is used in the disjunctive. At least one House member asked to amend the proposed language for the definition to change "can be shown" to "must be shown." That proposal was never even formally advanced to a vote.
                <p>
                    In addition to protecting against discrimination based on a gender-related identity, the law will also protect against discrimination based on "appearance and behavior," as well, "regardless of whether that appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth." The bill does not list illustrative methods for demonstrating the person's appearance or behaviors. As a result of the definition, the law will provide comprehensive protections for transgender people regardless of whether or not the person undergoes gender transition and regardless of the person's stage of gender transition."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.northumbria.ac.uk/sd/academic/law/staffprofiles/asavage/">Ashley Savage</a> of Northumbria University Law School in the UK says that in light of recent leaks to the media and through the Internet, there must be more robust protections for whistleblowers and more effective systems for addressing their concerns internally... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/ashleysavage.jpg" height="200" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he case of former senior National Security Agency (NSA) official Thomas Drake requires an examination of current whistleblower laws in the context of changes to information sharing, such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Wikileaks">Wikileaks</a> and other online outlets. Drake became concerned with the agency's decision to choose a data collection program costing billions of dollars over a less costly and less intrusive alternative. He believed that the program flouted privacy protections afforded to US citizens by the Fourth Amendment. Drake reportedly raised these concerns with his superiors before contacting the NSA Inspector General. When he did not receive a satisfactory response there, he contacted the Department of Defense Inspector General. Still dissatisfied, he escalated the matter to both the House and Senate Committees on Intelligence. When Drake still believed he had not received a satisfactory response, he contacted a reporter at the <em>Baltimore Sun</em>. The newspaper later published a series of articles detailing waste and mismanagement in the NSA. </p>

<p>Drake was indicted with the offence of "willful retention of classified information" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html">Espionage Act of 1917</a>. Drake maintained in his defence that despite discussing the situation with the reporter, he had been careful not to breach national security. In a spectacular back down, federal prosecutors withdrew the charges as part of a deal which resulted in Drake pleading guilty to the misdemeanour offence of "exceeding authorized use of a computer." The episode is particularly significant. Drake did not initially choose to leak swathes of unredacted documents to an outlet on the Internet. Instead, he followed the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=105_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ272.105">Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998</a> by exhausting the official mechanisms available to him.</p>

<p>In 2004, the 9/11 Commission Panel Report stated that "[d]emocracy's best oversight mechanism is public interest disclosure." In 2008, then presidential candidate Barack Obama proclaimed, "[g]overnment whistleblowers are part of a healthy democracy and must be protected from reprisal." The Drake prosecution, along with four other prosecutions for unauthorized disclosures, may present a significant departure from this ethos and may be part of what some consider as a "backlash" occurring against whistleblowers. For example, in December 2010, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S372:">Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act</a>, which contained measures to strengthen protection afforded to national security employees, failed to pass following a senator's anonymous hold. Following the leaking of thousands of documents to Wikileaks, the US Army introduced a new regulation entitled the <a href="http://www.dami.army.pentagon.mil/docs/r381_12.pdf">"Threat Awareness and Reporting Program,"</a> [PDF] which requires service personnel to report possible indications of subversion or leaks to the media. Lastly, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.754:">Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011</a> would have allowed the head of the respective intelligence agency to determine that a present or former employee had failed to obtain authorization for making a disclosure and should therefore lose their current or future pension benefits. The provision was blocked following a public hold by Senator Ron Wyden.<br />
 <br />
The recent developments, together with the Drake episode, are likely to have three possible outcomes for the would-be whistleblower considering whether and how to raise their concerns. First, they may decide that following Drake's experience, they should use the official channels available and be deterred from making an unauthorized disclosure. Second, conversely, the employee may decide that they do not trust the official mechanisms and that they cannot risk making direct contact with a journalist, and so anonymous disclosure to an online outlet such as Wikileaks is the best option. Such a course of action could be detrimental to the organization concerned and harmful to national security. Third, they may decide not to raise their concerns at all. Such an option would be detrimental to the organization, to congressional oversight, and to the wider public interest.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe has determined that authorized concern reporting "fuels less mistrust" within an organization than anonymous disclosures and makes it easier for the whistleblower to be protected against possible retaliation or victimization. However, when whistleblowing through official channels has failed or necessity demands it, one must consider whether it would be more appropriate to introduce a form of "safety valve" to allow for wider disclosures to the public or media. In a report outlining the best practice for intelligence services, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism identified whistleblower protections that should extend to disclosures to the media or the public if they are made "as a last resort" and "pertain to matters of significant public concern." These guidelines have been followed in Canada, where the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-5/page-1.html">Security of Information Act of 2001</a> aims to balance the public interest in disclosure against the public interest of non-disclosure, creating a positive obligation to utilize the official channels whilst allowing for external disclosure when the employee has not received a response in a reasonable time. However, these conditions do not apply if the disclosure was necessary to avoid grievous bodily harm or death.</p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding the Drake case offer a timely opportunity for US officials to carefully review how the situation was handled and assess the effectiveness of the response. The pace of technological advancements has made it easier and faster to publish unauthorized material. When leaks do occur, emphasis is often placed on punishment of the leaker and future prevention without a clear focus on why the leak occurred in the first place. Reliance upon outdated legislation such as the Espionage Act or the UK's <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/6/contents">Official Secrets Act of 1989</a> can only go so far to deter future unauthorized disclosures. Public servants will continue to be the ultimate arbiters of whether to use an authorized mechanism or to leak material. The provision of robust official mechanisms and a culture whereby raising concerns is actively encouraged through those channels may go part of the way in securing the objective of preventing future leaks, and do so by markedly less draconian means.</p>

		<title>Third Circuit Leaves Student Off-Campus Speech Rights Undecided</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pages.citebite.com/r7h9a0l2bnpo">Sara Rose</a>, Staff Attorney for the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a>, argues that although the recent Third Circuit ruling on student speech was the right one, it did not go far enough in ensuring the constitutional rights of public school students...<hr height='1'><strong>A</strong> middle-school student, annoyed after being disciplined by her principal for violating the school dress code, vents her frustration by posting a crude MySpace profile on the Internet parodying the principal. The profile, which the student created entirely from home and made available to a small group of friends, includes a photo of the principal but not his name or school. The profile only comes onto school grounds at the behest of the principal. Nevertheless, once the identity of the profile's author is discovered, the school suspends her from classes for ten days.</p>

                <p>Those are the facts of a case, <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084138p.pdf">JS v. Blue Mountain School District</a> [PDF], recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-rules-schools-cannot-punish-students-for-speech-outside-school.php">decided</a> in the student's favor by the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The case squarely presented an issue increasingly confronted by schools and their students: How far can public schools can go in punishing students for speech that they post on the Internet outside of school? On one side are the school districts and school board associations, which argue that schools should be permitted to police their students' speech no matter where it occurs if the speech is about the school.  On the other are groups like the ACLU, which believe putting such far-reaching authority into the hands of school administrators impermissibly infringes on students' First Amendment right to free speech.</p>

                <p>The Third Circuit, unfortunately, did not provide a clear answer to the question. While the Court, sitting <em>en banc</em>, did hold that schools cannot punish students for off-campus speech simply because it is lewd, vulgar, or indecent, the majority stopped short of deciding whether schools can punish students for off-campus speech if it causes a material and substantial disruption inside the school. In a footnote, the majority said it did not need to reach that issue because the parody MySpace profile did not cause any disruption inside the school nor could it have reasonably led school officials to forecast substantial disruption in the school. The "material and substantial disruption" test was created by the US Supreme Court in its 1969 decision <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15235797139493194004&scilh=0">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District</a> to protect students' free-speech rights in school while providing some leeway for school officials to maintain order and accomplish their pedagogical mission. </p>

                <p>Although the issue of whether the so-called <em>Tinker</em> standard can be used to curtail students' out-of-school speech has officially been left open by the Third Circuit, there were five votes for a more protective standard for off-campus speech. Four judges joined a concurring opinion by Judge D. Brooks Smith stating the view that students should have the same right as any other person in the community to speak outside of school. Under that standard, students' Facebook status updates, twitter posts, and even old-fashioned letters to the editor could not be censored by school administrators unless they could show that their actions were narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest and represented the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. That is a much tougher test for school districts to meet than the "material and substantial disruption" test, but it is the only standard that adequately protects the free-speech rights of public-school students.</p>

                <p>As Judge Smith recognized in his concurring opinion, allowing schools to apply the <em>Tinker</em> standard to out-of-school speech would have "ominous implications":  "Doing so would empower schools to regulate students' expressive activity no matter where it takes place, when it occurs, or what subject matter it involves&#8212;so long as it causes a substantial disruption at school."  Indeed, the Second Circuit, which has applied the <em>Tinker</em> standard to off-campus speech where it was reasonably foreseeable that the speech would come to the attention of school officials, upheld the decision of a school district to bar a student from running for senior class secretary after she criticized school administrators on her personal blog. The student was not permitted to serve as secretary even after she was elected by her classmates as a write-in candidate.  </p>

                <p>Public schools have a responsibility to teach students about their constitutional rights. Overriding the votes of the senior class or punishing students simply because they posted critical comments about school officials on the Internet sends the wrong message about how our Bill of Rights is supposed to work. School officials who act like Big Brother or retaliate against students who criticize them do a disservice to their students and to the Constitution.</p>

		<title>Florida ruling highlights arbitrariness of death penalty</title>

This ruling has been a long time coming and may have a significant impact on Florida capital cases. The problem is with the way Florida decides who should be sentenced to death. In most death penalty states and under federal law, the questions of guilt and capital sentencing are both determined by a unanimous jury. In Florida (and a few other states), the jury determines guilt, but only makes a recommendation with respect to sentencing. Despite the fact that a decision about life and death is more critical than one about guilt or innocence, the US Supreme Court has upheld this practice.

                <p>Imagine if a jury found a defendant guilty of second-degree murder, but was unsure of their finding on first-degree murder. Further imagine that the judge then decided on his own that the defendant was indeed guilty in the first degree. That would be unconstitutional because the more serious conviction must also be determined beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. Essentially, Florida has been allowing a comparable procedure to take place in death sentencing. The jury finds the defendant guilty of murder, but makes no determination on whether the facts make him eligible for the higher degree of murder that could result in a death sentence. In Florida, that factual determination is left to the judge.</p>

                <p>In 2002, the US Supreme Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13989927396342823081">Ring v. Arizona</a> that aggravating factors that make a defendant eligible for the death penalty fall under the Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination. Through further appeals, Florida's statute now will be closely examined in light of this decision. With the second largest death row in the country, the implications for the state could be significant, though not as sweeping as they probably should be. That is because the Supreme Court held that <em>Ring</em> was not retroactive, meaning it only applied to cases where the conviction was not yet final.</p>

                <p>One of the interesting things about <em>Ring</em> is that the Supreme Court admitted they had made a mistake.  The same issue had been put before them earlier, but they had misread the Arizona statute at issue. Despite this error, and despite the fact that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is a fundamental precept of our justice system, the Court ruled in 2004 that defendants whose cases were beyond direct appeal could not benefit from this ruling, even if they were deprived of a jury. These rulings expose the continuing arbitrariness of the death penalty, a problem more fully explored in the Death Penalty Information Center's latest <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/StruckByLightning.pdf">report</a> [PDF] "Struck By Lightning: The Continuing Arbitrariness of the Death Penalty Thirty-Five Years After Its Reinstatement in 1976."</p>

Entertainment Merchants Association</a> continued the Court's trend of limiting legislative attempts to create new categories of unprotected speech. It rejected the concept of violence as obscenity, refusing to expand that category beyond its sexual moorings.

                <p>The final result comported with what many in the First Amendment community had predicted. After all, every lower court to analyze a similar violent video game law or ordinance had invalidated them. However, the case was argued on November 2 and as I mentioned in a previous <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/whats-taking-so-long-in-the-violent-video-game-case">analysis</a>, speculation grew as to the reasons for the long delay.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, a majority of the Court reiterated the line of thinking that unprotected categories must be rooted in history and tradition rather than created willy-nilly by legislators.</p>

                <p>Justice Frank Murphy articulated the categorical approach years ago in the fighting words decision <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=124249671461500618">Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</a> when he wrote: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words..."</p>

                <p>The Court still utilizes the categorical approach to determine whether speech constitutes obscenity, incitement to imminent lawless action, true threats, child pornography, libel, fighting words and a few others.</p>

                <p>Last term in the dog-fighting video case <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">US v. Stevens</a>, Chief Justice John Roberts refused to create another exception for images of animal cruelty, writing that past decisions such as the child pornography case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1226851723986989726">New York v. Ferber</a> "cannot be taken as establishing a freewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the First Amendment."</p>

                <p>Justice Antonin Scalia in his majority opinion wrote that <em>Stevens</em> controlled as the leading precedent. He emphatically rejected California lawmakers "freewheeling" attempt to "shoehorn speech about violence into obscenity." He reiterated that unprotected categories of speech must be rooted in history and tradition&#8212;not created out of whole cloth by legislatures based on uncertain social science.</p>

                <p>I attended the Court's session on June 27 when the justices handed down the violent video game decision and three others. Justice Scalia appeared to relish reciting the portion of his opinion where he cited a litany of examples of violence in children's fairy tales. Last November at <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-video-game-law.php">oral argument</a>, Scalia had elicited laughter from the gallery when he commented: "I mean, some of the Grimms' fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth." He remembered his laugh-inducing line when writing his majority opinion: "Certainly the books we give children to read&#8212;or read to them when they are younger&#8212;contain no shortage of gore. <em>Grimm's Fairy Tales</em>, for example, are grim indeed." He then cited tales of violence besetting <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Cinderella</em> and <em>Hansel and Gretel</em>.</p>

                <p>Scalia served as the Grim Reaper for the law would expand obscenity from sex into violence.</p>

                <p>That was good for the First Amendment.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sandlerreiff.com/attorneys/john-hardin-young/">John Hardin Young</a>, Counsel for Sandler Reiff Young &amp; Lamb, PC, argues that the recent Supreme Court opinion striking down Arizona's campaign finance regulations leaves few options for future campaign finance reform...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/jackyoung.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n Monday, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">ruled</a> that an Arizona law giving additional funds to publicly financed candidates if independent expenditures opposing the candidate reached a certain level was a violation of the First Amendment. The case, <em>McComish v. Bennett</em>, builds on the holding of <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">Davis v. FEC</a> to continue the development of limitations on campaign finance regulation&#8212;here, the issue was whether a state regulatory regime which attempts to equalize the political speech of competing entities can pass muster under the First Amendment. The Roberts majority appears to be on a slow march towards an unfettered First Amendment right to certain forms of political speech, strictly limiting the government's ability to regulate such speech and limiting the traditional anti-corruption rationale adopted by the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11397892430187334248">Buckley v. Valeo</a>. The goal of equalizing the players on the political stage is no longer an option for reformers. <em>McComish</em> and <em>Davis</em>, thus, portend an era of broadened First Amendment applications to political speech.<br />
                <p><br />
                    The rejection of the equalization rationale discussed in <em>Davis</em>, and adopted in <em>McComish</em>, appears to limit future regulation. Reformers will be forced to make the case for regulation based on the anti-corruption interest set forth in Buckley. <em>Davis</em> and <em>McComish</em> will make it difficult to pass any law that regulates the equality of political speech. What's left, at least for now, is the potential for strong political contribution and expenditure disclosure laws, which should satisfy the Court's constitutional concerns. Then again, the Roberts Court has shown a propensity for a wholesale free market approach to campaign finance regulation.</p>

		<title>Migrant Workers&amp;apos; Rights in Lebanon: The Need for a New Mentality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Megan McKee, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2012, worked as a legal researcher for the <a href="http://www.cisdl.org/news.html">Centre for International Sustainable Development Law</a> and is currently working in Lebanon. She writes about the need for greater rights for migrant workers in that country, especially for those employed as domestic workers... <hr height="1"><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t is estimated that there are some 50 to 100 million domestic workers worldwide. The vast majority of these workers are young girls and women, and a large percentage of them are migrants. They serve as nannies, housekeepers, cooks, and caregivers, who are most densely concentrated in the Middle East and Asia. Since they are often excluded from workers' and laborers' rights schemes, they often suffer from unpaid wages, excessive hours, little time off and a high frequency of physical and sexual abuse, making them some of the most exploited workers in the world. Additionally, their status as young, impoverished, foreign females, further contributes to their vulnerability and marginalization.</p>

<p>During its annual conference this month, the International Labor Organization <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/international-labor-body-passes-new-convention-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">adopted</a> a historic treaty that aims to create an international standard for protecting the rights of migrant domestic workers for the first time. The <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_157836.pdf">Convention on Domestic Workers</a> [PDF] strives to establish standards that bring the rights of domestic workers into line with the rights more commonly enjoyed by individuals employed outside the home. The convention states that domestic workers must work reasonable hours, must have a weekly rest of at least 24 consecutive hours, limits in-kind payment, requires clear information on terms of employment, a minimum wage and basic rights, such as freedom of association and collective bargaining. </p>

<p>The adoption of the treaty by most delegates from Arab nations was remarkable due to both the large number of migrant domestic workers employed in the region, and their previous opposition to the convention. Previously viewing the effort as unnecessary and impractical, suggesting that workers employed in the home were treated as members of the family, the delegates' change of heart signals an important and necessary step toward the radical change in thinking that must take place regarding the rights of domestic workers. However, despite supporting the convention, the delegates quite aptly highlighted challenges to ratification, implementation and enforcement in their respective countries. </p>

<p>Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hrw-urges-lebanon-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">released</a> a 54-page report entitled <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/09/16/without-protection">"Without Protection"</a> that detailed the treatment of migrant domestic workers in Lebanon. It uncovered a particularly grim reality for the nation's estimated 225,000 migrant workers hailing from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, among other nations. The report reviewed over 100 judicial decisions concerning various complaints made by migrant domestic workers, and did not find a single instance in which employers that had forcibly confined workers to the house, confiscated their passports or denied them food were actually charged with a crime. It further found that the lack of a viable and accessible complaint reporting mechanism, lengthy judicial proceedings and a restrictive visa policy further discouraged many from pursing or even reporting abuses of their rights in the first place. Based on the cases reviewed, HRW estimated that criminal claims took an average of 24 months to resolve, that complaints for unpaid wages took between 21 and 54 months and that even simplified complaints made in labor courts took an average of 32 months. Additionally, under Lebanon's work visa sponsorship system, a worker that leaves an employer, even to file a legally viable complaint, forfeits her right to stay in Lebanon and faces potential detention and deportation as an illegal alien.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, to say that abuse is not prosecuted altogether would be incorrect. For instance, some cases of severe abuse have been prosecuted, but they continue to be rare and unfailingly result in lenient sentences. For example, in a widely hailed case from December 2009, an employer was convicted of repeatedly beating her domestic worker. However, the sentence was only 15 days. In another, similar case from June 2010, a Lebanese criminal court issued what appears to be the most severe sentence to date to an employer, who repeatedly beat and forcibly confined her domestic worker to the house. Yet the sentence was just one month. </p>

<p>Perhaps a testament to the harsh working conditions in Lebanon is the HRW finding that on average more than one migrant domestic worker dies every week, either as a result of suicide or during an attempt to escape from the high-rise apartments their employers confine them to. The Filipino government's 2007 decision to ban their citizens from working in Lebanon is another testament to the subpar conditions workers face. Likewise, Sri Lanka and Indonesia have introduced significant measures to better protect their citizens employed as domestic workers in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Lebanon has made attempts to ameliorate the situation through legislation. For example, it recently adopted measures to regulate employment agencies and to adopt a mandatory standardized contract that would include mandatory provisions, such as at least one day off a week. Furthermore, the Lebanese Ministers of Labor and the Interior recently brought the situation to the attention of the parliament with promises of reform. However, while currently marked by relative calm compared to much of the Middle East, Lebanon has dealt with a series of disputes, setbacks and political changes that have left the central government paralyzed since January. Accordingly, attempts at reform have languished and the measures seeking to regulate employment agencies and standardize contracts still need to be implemented properly. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, legal discussions, attempted legislative reform, and even the ratification of international treaties, is arguably simple in comparison to fomenting the radical change in thinking that the region needs to undergo in order to see these reforms implemented. In Lebanon, conventional wisdom dictates that domestic workers are little more than servants attached to a household. As such, they are accorded very little respect. Their personal rights and freedoms even less so.</p>

<p>For example, it is widely accepted in Lebanon that the initial investment an employer makes in bringing a worker to the country justifies restricting the worker's movement, both through confiscating her travel documents and through confining her to the house. This is viewed as rightfully limiting the employer's risk of loss, as it makes it virtually impossible for the worker to run away. This mentality makes the complete forfeiture of the freedom of movement one of the normative expectations of the job, and it is even prevalent among employers that generally treat their domestic employees well in other ways. It is particularly common in the early stages of employment before some level of trust has been established between employer and employee. </p>

<p>While the existence of more extreme forms of abuse are concerning and should be taken seriously, the more pervasive and alarming issue in Lebanon is the fact that otherwise relatively humane individuals, who would never physically harm an employee, think nothing of practices that are most certainly still forms of abuse. This is derivative of a mentality in Lebanon, and the region in general, which condones the substandard and inhumane treatment of these workers. This mentality arises from prejudice, a disdain for poverty, and what is viewed as degrading work. The failure of both the nation's police and prosecutors to take instances of physical violence against migrant domestic workers seriously, often turning a blind eye to it altogether, and the failure of the nation's lawmakers to effectively implement protections and accord rights to migrant domestic workers, serves to demonstrate the widespread and pervasive nature of this mentality.</p>

<p>What is encouraging, however, are several recent events that suggest a trend towards a more humane view of domestic workers in Lebanon. Just a week after the Arab delegates to the ILO conference supported the adoption of the convention, the UN Country Team in Lebanon adopted a voluntary code of conduct reflecting many of the convention's principles. This code was intended to set a trend in the region and will be followed by all UN staff in Lebanon. Even more suggestive of a changing mentality are the many grassroots efforts raising awareness and providing much needed services and education to migrant workers. This trend can be witnessed in the proliferation of blogs and Facebook groups, and in the activities of local NGOs that serve as safe havens and centers for education and socialization.</p>

<p>It appears that at least a portion of Lebanese society, and perhaps a sizable portion of the younger generation, are beginning to develop a more humane view of domestic workers. This will hopefully carry over to law enforcement officials and labor inspectors, aiding them in identifying and seriously prosecuting violations against domestic workers. With any luck, it will also encourage Lebanon's parliament to seriously reform the sponsorship system and properly implement the regulations that have already been adopted.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://newhouse.syr.edu/Faculty_Staff/Bio/index.cfm?id=55">Roy Gutterman</a> of Syracuse University says that the Supreme Court's recent ruling on violent video games, in conjunction with prior First Amendment jurisprudence, maintains necessary constitutional safeguards for speakers and listeners... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/roygutterman.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he beeps and blips of today's modern video games, complete with graphic and sometimes interactive depictions of violence, warrants First Amendment protection, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-games-ban.php">ruled</a> on Monday.</p>

<p>Standing firmly behind the First Amendment, Justice Antonin Scalia shot down a California law banning the sale of violent video games to minors in one of the term's hot-button cases, <em>Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association</em>. The 7-2 decision brings First Amendment protections to the modern medium of video games. This important ruling is consistent with the Court's protection over the years as new forms of expression, dissemination and information emerge&#8212;think about radio, television, films and the internet which have been recognized for protection over the decades. </p>

<p>Extending the First Amendment to violent video games is also consistent with the Court's recent First Amendment decisions. In March, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-allows-military-funeral-protests.php">Snyder v. Phelps</a>, held the free speech rights of offensive protesters outweighed the privacy rights of grieving families and last term, in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission</a>, the Court held corporations have First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>More critical to the Court's decision this week was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">US v. Stevens</a>, last term's case which refused to categorize the sale and distribution of videos depicting animal cruelty as outside the scope of the First Amendment. As a controlling precedent, Justice Scalia wrote that in <em>Stevens</em> "we held new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated." Couple the Court's reluctance to expand the categories of speech that the government can restrict with modern technology and the widespread, cross-generational popularity of video games, and <em>Brown</em> is almost electrifying.</p>

<p>"[W]hatever the challenges of applying the Constitution to ever-advancing technology, 'the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment's command, do not vary' when a new and different medium for communication appears," Justice Scalia wrote.</p>

<p>Applying a strict scrutiny analysis, the law's attempt to regulate the sale of violent video games to minors failed as a content-based restriction that was both underinclusive and overinclusive. To protect children, the law banned the sale to minors so-called violent video games. The law had a labeling requirement and the potential for a $1,000 fine. Challenged on facial grounds by a group of video game producers, California essentially created a new category of speech subject to regulation, punishment or censorship. </p>

<p>California hinged the law and its appellate arguments on the concept of "variable obscenity," the doctrine that criminalizes sexual content in the hands of minors under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8460647428333624773">Ginsberg v. New York</a>. However, sexual content and violent content, even in the hands of minors, are distinguishable to the point where Justice Scalia called the state's efforts a "shoehorn" attempt to create a new category of speech falling outside the scope of the First Amendment. Further, the law was "unprecedented and mistaken," Justice Scalia wrote.</p>

<p>The state's content discrimination singled out video game producers while children could be exposed to the same types of violent depictions in other media, even materials children are encouraged to access in schools. "Here, California has singled out the purveyors of video games for disfavored treatment&#8212;at least when compared to booksellers, cartoonists, and movie producers&#8212;and has given no persuasive reason why," Justice Scalia wrote.  </p>

<p>Justice Scalia repeated a quip from oral arguments when he wrote that <u>Grimm's Fairy Tales</u> are "grim indeed" while other stories including <u>Snow White</u> and <u>Cinderella</u> have violent themes and depictions. Some staples of high school literature including <u>The Odyssey of Homer</u>, <u>Dante's Inferno</u> and <u>Lord of the Flies</u> depict the same graphic violence California sought to ban and punish in the form of video games.</p>

<p>"Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas&#8212;and even social messages&#8212;through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection," he wrote.</p>

<p>For decades, lawmakers have attempted to enact and enforce content-based restrictions with the goal of protecting children. Comic books, pulp paperbacks, radio and films have all been the subject of regulatory attempts. The only category to survive First Amendment scrutiny over the years has been sexual content under <em>Ginsberg</em> because of the compelling government interest and proven harm that comes from children's exposure to this material.  </p>

<p>However, in the past decade, courts have struck down attempts to regulate video games seven times, a point Justice Scalia reiterated. At the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-video-game-law.php">oral arguments</a> in November, Justice Scalia aggressively questioned California's lawyers about the law and its censoring effect. However, in the opinion, Scalia did not entirely dismiss governmental concerns or the concerns of parents to protect their children from potentially harmful content. Scalia wrote that "[e]ven where the protection of children is the object, the constitutional limits on government action apply."</p>

<p>Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, concurred, arguing that the law should have been shot down on vagueness rather than First Amendment grounds. Justice Alito described the types of games in graphic terms, and that reading violent content in a book is markedly different than the interactive experience of modern video games. Though he would not apply the First Amendment as extensively, he still felt the law lacked firm definitions. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the statute survived an originalist interpretation while Justice Stephen Breyer, who was openly skeptical at oral arguments, argued that the law was justified because the state had a compelling state interest.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Court refused to carve out a new exception to First Amendment protection. Over the decades, the Court has found a compelling government interest to suppress or punish categories of speech where there is a provable harm and a compelling state interest: obscenity, incitement and fighting words. Requiring a compelling interest provides necessary constitutional safeguards for both speakers and listeners (or creators and players) and the government, intent on protecting citizens and their rights or simply keeping the peace. However, violent video games in the hands of minors certainly does not rise to the status of the other categories.  </p>

<p>Justice Scalia also noted that the video game industry created its own ratings system for its games designed to provide parents with guidance. A voluntary ratings system takes the crucial step to remove the government from the game and the First Amendment lets the creators create and the gamers play.</p>

		<title>New York Marriage Bill Suffers From Procedural Infirmities</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marriagelawfoundation.org/board.html">William Duncan</a>, Director of the Marriage Law Foundation, argues that whether or not same-sex marriage is a beneficial public policy, the New York legislation sets a bad precedent and is possibly unconstitutional under the state constitution due to violations of procedural requirements...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/williamduncan.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>P</strong></font>utting aside the merits of the recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">enacted</a> law creating same-sex marriage in New York, the way it was approved raises some important legal questions; specifically about the application of two constitutional provisions to the unconventional process of the amendment's passage in the Senate.</p>

                <p>First, Article III, section 14, of the <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/constitution.htm">New York Constitution</a> provides:<blockquote>No bill shall be passed or become a law unless it shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members, in its final form, at least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless the governor, or the acting governor, shall have certified, under his or her hand and the seal of the state, the facts which in his or her opinion necessitate an immediate vote thereon.</blockquote>Not only was <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/A8354-2011">Assembly Bill 8520</a> not available 72 hours before the vote last Friday, it was not public until earlier that same day. Of course, proponents claim this procedure was "necessary" but wanting to get a favored bill passed quickly does not seem to be the type of "necessity" contemplated by the Constitution. The New York Court of Appeals explained this constitutional requirement in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13793179820077972360">Schneider v. Rockefeller</a>: "The clear purpose of this provision is to prevent hasty and careless legislation, to prohibit amendments at the last moment, and to insure that the proposed legislation receives adequate publicity and consideration." It may be that courts will not want to examine the sufficiency of the governor's determination of necessity, but that should not insulate the determination from public criticism and debate. The governor's certification of the reasons for the quick procedure should be made readily available immediately.</p>

                <p>Second, Article III, section 10 requires: "The doors of each house shall be kept open, except when the public welfare shall require secrecy." Senator Kevin Parker <a href="http://www.gothamgazette.com/blogs/wonkster/2011/06/25/why-sen-kevin-parker-got-mad/">revealed</a> after the vote that the members were locked in the chamber. It is possible, of course, to read the open door requirement as merely an openness provision that would be met by televising the proceedings, but it is troubling that this part of the Constitution was not more carefully adhered to. The requirement of openness was more blatantly violated in other instances. The story reporting on Senator Parker also explained: "Bill Mahoney of the New York Public Interest Research Group was told by two state troopers that the public was not allowed into committee meetings. Mahoney informed them that this was illegal and they responded they were just following orders."</p>

                <p>Other procedural irregularities, such as the failure to allow senators to speak to the bill or to allow the bill to be laid aside for debate are also relevant to this discussion. It has been reported that the governor was anxious for a quick resolution in order to allow the vote to be reported on the 11 o'clock news. This may be a politically savvy course but it does not necessarily comport with the law and these questions ought to get more attention and the actions of the governor and his Senate supporters deserves scrutiny.</p>

                <p>At the very least, the procedure for passage of same-sex marriage in the New York Senate contravenes the principles underlying the constitutional provisions noted above. Those provisions attempt to secure an open, transparent and deliberative process. By contrast, the procedure followed to get the same-sex marriage bill through as quickly as possible was characterized by secrecy, curtailed discussion and top-down control. The important changes to the bill's religious exemption were not only not explored at any length, but the attempt of Senator Ruben Diaz to ask questions about these provisions (which had only become public a few hours before) was completely foreclosed.</p>

                <p>However one comes down on whether same-sex marriage is good public policy, its passage in New York clearly sets a bad precedent, perhaps rendering its enactment illegal.</p>

                <p><em>William Duncan formerly served as acting director of the Marriage Law Project at the Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law and as executive director of the Marriage and Family Law Research Grant at Brigham Young University J. Reuben Clark Law School, where he was also a visiting professor.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=21">Charles Fried</a> of Harvard Law School says that the recent appellate court ruling finding the individual mandate constitutional gave the law's opponents their full due in a careful and thoughtful manner, but went on to properly dismiss their arguments... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/charlesfried.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>R</b></font>ecently, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld</a> the individual mandate provision of the health care reform legislation. Although the opinion of the court was written by Judge Boyce Martin,  Judge Jeffrey Sutton's concurrence provides the controlling rationale. Judge Sutton's opinion in the case is a remarkably thorough, balanced and thoughtful opinion. It gives the objectors to the mandate their full due. It does what serious jurists should but too often do not do: consider the arguments in their best light, not their worst. This is why his conclusion is so devastatingly convincing. I cannot do better than to commend this model of careful thought and analysis to every interested person's attention.</p>

<p>I would add only a two observations: First, I wonder if we are not misled by trying to meet the activity/inactivity objection&#8212;although Judge Sutton does so. As Chief Justice John Marshall stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1173503503763993716">Gibbons v. Ogden</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272959520166823796">McCulloch v. Maryland</a>, Congress has the power to regulate a subject matter: commerce. The activity/inactivity distinction nowhere occurs in his opinions or in subsequent cases. If none of the subsequent cases are cases of inactivity, that is not a point against the mandate; many new regulatory schemes include aspects of novelty (some perhaps far greater than what is presented here&#8212;consider the various environmental laws). Undoubtedly health insurance is commerce. Following Justice Marshall, what Congress has done is regulate it. As Justice Marshall also teaches us, once a matter is within the power of Congress, that power is (in his word) plenary, unless its mode is in some sense improper. So here is a subject (health insurance) and here is a regulation of it, which is unquestionably necessary to the success of the regulatory scheme. Even the egregious <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">opinion</a> from the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida acknowledged that necessity, which is why it struck down the whole law. Why is that not the end of the inquiry? As Justice Robert Jackson wrote in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685">Wickard v. Filburn</a>: "The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions and restrictions thereon."</p>

<p>Then there is the "where are the limits?" argument. The limits are the limits implicit in the concept of commerce. A person committing a violent act against another is not commerce, as held by the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">US v. Morrison</a>, and the attempt by Congress to regulate it was for that reason outside its power. Remote and suppositious relations between such actions and commerce were properly rejected. However, there is no such reach here. Health insurance is commerce and the mandate is a necessary part of this scheme for regulating it.</p>

<p>But is this regulation "proper?" To urge its impropriety in terms of activity/inactivity or individual liberty, or the right to be let alone is not a commerce clause argument. A general liberty argument would be fatal to similar state regulation; and Judge Sutton disposes of the Tenth Amendment argument masterfully.</p>

		<title>Passage of New York Marriage Bill a Vote of Conscience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hrc.org/about_us/13581.htm">Sarah Warbelow</a>, State Legislative Director for Human Rights Campaign, argues that the passage of same-sex marriage legislation in New York coincides with changing attitudes about same-sex marriage nationally, despite ongoing efforts across the country to prevent similar legislation elsewhere...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/sarahwarbelow.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast week, the New York state legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">passed</a> legislation legalizing marriage for same-sex couples, making it the sixth state in the nation, in addition to the District of Columbia, where gay and lesbian couples have the freedom to wed. The State Senate's passage of the bill late Friday night came after a long week of deadlock, with 31 senators publicly in favor of the bill and 31 others opposed or still undecided about their votes. In the end, it was a bipartisan effort led by Governor Andrew Cuomo that brought the bill to the floor, and the courage of senators on both sides to break with their parties and vote with their conscience that lead to the bill's final passage.</p>

                <p>New York's "conscience vote" was a refreshing change. In recent months and years, marriage bills in other states have fallen victim to party line votes, often with little to no substantive discussion. Just a few short months ago, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/colorado-senate-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">Colorado civil unions bill</a> was defeated on a party line vote after opponents inaccurately claimed that a vote for civil unions was a vote for same-sex marriages. In contrast, the effort in New York was bipartisan from the beginning, with Democrats and Republicans meeting frequently to discuss concerns and negotiate language in the bill. In the end, four Republicans joined 29 Democrats to pass the measure and made marriage equality in the Empire State a reality.</p>

                <p>New York is now the largest state to allow same-sex couples to wed, and passage of the bill effectively doubled the number of Americans who live in a place where same-sex marriage is legal (about 11 percent of the total population).  New York joins <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> as the seventh US jurisdiction where such marriages are now allowed.</p>

                <p>Passage of the bill coincided with recent changes in public sentiment about same-sex marriage, both in New York and nationally. In New York, just 37 percent of the state's residents supported allowing same-sex couples to wed in 2004, but this year polls showed that support jumped to 58 percent. Nationally, a Gallup <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx">poll</a> released in May showed that for the first time, a majority of Americans (53 percent) support same-sex marriage. </p>

                <p>Advocates are hopeful that the victory in New York will keep the momentum going for other states seeking marriage equality. In Maryland, the House Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/maryland-house-fails-to-advance-bill-legalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">retracted</a> a same-sex marriage bill in the current legislative session with the hopes of preserving it for passage in the 2012 session. In Minnesota, proponents of marriage equality will be fighting a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnestoa-legislator-ballot-measure-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">proposed constitutional amendment</a> on the 2012 ballot which seeks to limit the definition of marriage to a union between one man and one woman. Finally, same-sex marriage supporters in Maine announced this week that they plan to collect signatures to put the issue of same-sex marriage on the ballot there in 2012. With the lessons of New York in mind, advocates are optimistic that the freedom to marry the person you love is closer than ever to becoming a reality nationwide.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Representative <a href="http://www.pahouse.com/frankel/">Dan Frankel</a> of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives argues that Pennsylvania, and the rest of the country, should follow Connecticut's lead in enacting comprehensive protections for gender identity or expression to counter rampant discrimination against transgendered men and women...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/danfrankel.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> applaud Connecticut's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-passes-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.php">pass legislation</a> protecting its residents from discrimination based on gender identity or expression.</p>

                <p>Too often, legislation including protections based on gender identity or expression is considered an "add-on" to a broader policy preventing discrimination based on race, ability, religion, sex or sexual orientation. In fact, when it comes to workplace discrimination for men and women&#8212;particularly those in non-traditional fields&#8212;gender identity provides the legal underpinning to ensure that everyone receives the same basic protections, no matter how they dress, speak, or walk. </p>

                <p>In this way, protection from discrimination based on gender identity can actually prove to be the most powerful, as well as one of the most fundamental, tools we have to protect people in their homes, workplaces and public accommodations. Many assume that protection based on gender identity and expression provides expanded protections solely for transgender men and women, who identify with a different sex than that which they are biologically assigned at birth. Certainly, it does provide those essential protections, as it should. </p>

                <p>Discrimination against transgendered men and women is rampant, and we must ensure that all members of our community can work and live without fear that they will be fired or kicked out of their homes in response to someone else's anxiety about their deeply personal identity. However, the reach of legislation protecting on the basis of "gender identity or expression" is potentially much larger. This legislation actually provides broad protections for men and women who may not necessarily be clearly defined as "transgender." In effect, it offers basic protection to any person who does not always desire to express their assigned gender as the community-at-large might expect them to.  </p>

                <p>In the simplest example, many women could already be considered "cross-dressers" in the workplace. They wear what was formerly viewed as masculine garb&#8212;pants and a suit jacket. To differing extents, they may look more or less feminine in this masculine outfit. Protection based on gender expression would ensure that women who choose not to reinforce their femininity, or who pursue a more gender neutral appearance, could not be disciplined on that basis. Similarly, men who do not conform to gender stereotypes because they are deemed too "effeminate" would also be protected.  </p>

                <p>More than 20 years ago, Anne Hopkins sued Price Waterhouse Cooper, claiming that they violated sex discrimination laws when they passed her over for promotion because she was too "masculine." The Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=780752418377134939">agreed</a> with her. However, just a few years ago in Pennsylvania, a male employee who sued a company after being systematically harassed at work because he was not masculine enough lost his case. Pennsylvania provides no protections to the Commonwealth's lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender residents. In this instance, the court decided the Pennsylvania man faced harassment because his colleagues perceived him to be gay. The word "perceived" is critical in this context. His harassers did not necessarily know his sexual orientation, but they did not need to know it to feel that he did not meet their expectations for masculinity. Contrast that to a case of an accountant in Harrisburg whose boss had no idea of his sexual orientation until it was revealed on the news. Only then was he fired. </p>

                <p>These examples illustrate the complexities of protecting all of our citizens&#8212;not solely on the basis of race, ability, or sex&#8212;but also based on whom they love and the way they express themselves. </p>

                <p>Nothing in this legislation prohibits companies from having strict dress codes&#8212;people may still be required to remove nose rings, cover up tattoos, and cover up spaghetti straps. What the legislation does do is ensure that within the bounds of appropriateness for any company's dress code, employees can express their gender as they see fit. </p>

                <p>In today's world, it seems inconceivable that women would not be allowed to wear pants and flat-soled shoes. It's time for our human rights laws to catch up to the cultural norms that recognize, and accept, fluidity in gender expression. </p>

                <p><em>Dan Frankel is the Democratic Caucus Chair and represents Pennsylvania's twenty-third legislative district. He has repeatedly introduced legislation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Frankel is also a recipient of the Marjorie H. Matson Award, presented by the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, in recognition of his civil rights advocacy.</em></p>

		<title>Regulating Inactivity: A Radical Constitutional Departure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime/somin_ilya">Ilya Somin</a> of George Mason School of Law says that the recent appellate court decision finding the individual mandate constitutional undermines federalism, misconstrues the boundaries of congressional authority, and lays the groundwork for limitless federal mandates... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/Ilya_Somin.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>his week, the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">ruled</a> that the individual mandate of federal health care reform is constitutional. This is undeniably a setback for mandate opponents. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to purchase government-approved health insurance by 2014. Opponents of the law, including twenty-eight state governments and numerous private groups, have filed a variety of cases challenging its constitutionality. The Sixth Circuit was the first of several federal appellate courts to reach a decision in one of these cases, a suit brought by the Thomas More Law Center. Three other appellate courts are expected to issue their rulings within the next few months.</p>

<p>Before this decision, judges in these cases had split along ideological and partisan lines. Three liberal, Democrat-appointed trial judges have upheld the mandate, while two conservative, Republican-appointed judges have invalidated it. Even in the Sixth Circuit, two of the three judges fit the same pattern: Judge Boyce Martin, a Democrat-appointee who voted to uphold the law and Judge Daniel Graham, a Republican-appointee who dissented. Judge Jeffrey Sutton, however, a well-known conservative jurist, has now become the first exception to the trend. Like Martin, he voted to uphold the mandate as an exercise of congressional powers under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.<br />
 <br />
At the same time, the opinions by Martin and Sutton highlight a central weakness of the pro-mandate position in even more blatant form than previous opinions upholding the law. Their reasoning has very radical implications, giving Congress unlimited power to impose mandates of any kind, free of any structural limits on its authority. Their argument is also deeply at odds with the text of the Constitution. Unlike previous decisions upholding the mandate, which ruled that failing to purchase health insurance is "economic activity," Martin and Sutton conclude that Congress has the power to regulate inactivity as well, so long as the inactivity has some kind of "substantial" economic effect. For this reason, they reject the plaintiffs' argument that the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it regulates inactivity&#8212;the state of not having health insurance.<br />
 <br />
<strong><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Opening the Door to Unlimited Federal Power</strong></div></strong></p>

<p>The Martin-Sutton approach opens the floodgates to an unlimited congressional power to mandate personal behavior. Any failure to purchase a product has some substantial economic effect, at least when aggregated with similar failures by other people. This is certainly true of failures to purchase broccoli, failures to purchase cars, failure to buy a movie ticket, and so on. Each of these choices affects the economy and leaves producers worse off than they would be if more people bought their products. Even failure to engage in noncommercial activity nearly always has such effects.  A mandate requiring people to eat healthy food and exercise every day can be justified on the grounds that it would increase economic productivity and also increase the demand for healthy food products and gym memberships. The district court rulings in favor of the mandate all claim that health care is special in some way, in order to avoid this slippery slope. By contrast, Martin and Sutton take us all the way to the bottom of the hill in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Obviously, Congress will not enact every conceivable harmful mandate that the Martin-Sutton reasoning would authorize. The risk of abuse is <a href="http://volokh.com/2011/01/25/broccoli-slippery-slopes-and-the-individual-mandate/">far from purely theoretical</a>, however, since many interest groups can and will lobby for laws that compel people to purchase their products. Virtually any industry could benefit from a law forcing people to buy from them. Moreover, industry lobbyists out to make a profit could promote mandates by allying with public health activists, just as "bootleggers and baptists" famously <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv22n3/bootleggers.pdf">worked together to promote Prohibition</a> [PDF]. In that way, Congress could enact mandates requiring people to purchase healthy food or other products without having to admit that its goal was to benefit an influential industry lobby.<br />
Judge Sutton and others have suggested that abusive mandates might be prevented by constitutional protections for individual rights. However, current precedent does not provide for an individual rights protection against laws that force people to buy products they do not want.</p>

<p><strong><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Constitutional Text</strong></div></strong></p>

<p>The sweeping congressional power authorized by the Martin-Sutton rationale makes a hash of the text of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate "Commerce ... among the several states," not a blanket power to mandate anything that has a "substantial" economic effect.<br />
 <br />
At the time of the Founding, the framers and ratifiers of the Constitution consistently interpreted the Commerce Clause as only giving Congress the power to regulate transportation and trade in goods and services that crossed state lines. Even Alexander Hamilton took this view, the strongest advocate of broad federal authority among the Founding Fathers. This was also roughly the approach adopted by the Supreme Court during the first 150 years of American history.</p>

<p>The Martin-Sutton approach also makes most of the other congressional powers listed in Article I redundant. For example, there would be no need for a separate power to tax. After all, failure to give the government some of your money voluntarily surely has substantial economic effects. Therefore, virtually any tax could be imposed through the Commerce Clause, making the Tax Clause superfluous. Similarly, failure to serve in the armed forces surely has substantial economic effects. The Commerce Clause therefore authorizes Congress to impose a draft and purchase military equipment, thereby making the power to "raise and support" armies superfluous.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit ruling would still be defensible if it were compelled by Supreme Court precedent. However, both Martin and Sutton recognized that the Supreme Court has never previously ruled on a case involving a mandate of this type, and has also never previously addressed the issue of whether the Commerce Clause authorizes regulation of inactivity. </p>

<p>Since the 1930s, a series of flawed Supreme Court decisions have expanded congressional Commerce Clause authority well beyond what the text of the Constitution permits. These rulings allow the federal government to regulate almost any "economic activity." These cannot be used to uphold the individual mandate. Far from engaging in economic activity, people who decide not to purchase health insurance are actually refraining from doing so.</p>

<p>The most expansive Supreme Court Commerce Clause decision is its 2005 ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15647611274064109718">Gonzales v. Raich</a>, which held that Congress had the power to ban possession of medical marijuana that had never crossed state lines or been sold in any market. <em>Raich</em> was a badly flawed ruling that extended federal power to unprecedented lengths. Despite this, it still stopped short of justifying the individual mandate. In <em>Raich</em>, the Court ruled that marijuana possession is "economic activity," defined as anything that involves "production, distribution, and consumption of commodities." People who do not buy health insurance are not thereby producing, consuming, or distributing a commodity of any kind. To the contrary, they have chosen not to do any of these things.<br />
 <br />
The rule that the Commerce Clause can only be used to regulate some sort of preexisting activity is not only consistent with precedent; it also makes good intuitive sense. A power to regulate interstate commerce presupposes that there is some commerce out there to regulate. Judge Sutton points out that "the power to regulate includes the power to prescribe and proscribe." Congress may indeed use the power to regulate interstate commerce to "prescribe and proscribe" the behavior of people engaged in interstate commercial activity. For example, it has used it to forbid racial discrimination by hotel and restaurant owners. However, it cannot use it to force people to engage in commercial transactions merely because they happen to live in the United States. The civil rights laws upheld by the Court do not require anyone to open up a new restaurant and start serving food.</p>

<p>Similarly, congressional power to make rules for the "regulation of the land and naval forces" is a power to regulate people who are already members of the armed forces, not a power enabling Congress to force civilians to join the military. The latter can only be done, if at all, under the separate power to "raise and support Armies." That is why the Founders thought that both powers were necessary. If the power to regulate an army included the power to raise an army, there would have been no need for a separate clause authorizing Congress to do the latter. The Constitution does not give Congress the power to "raise and support" commerce. In that field, it only has the power to regulate.</p>

<p><strong><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Reprising the "Health Care is Special" Argument</strong></div></strong></p>

<p>Martin and Sutton both also make the argument that a health insurance mandate is a special case because everyone will use health care at some point in their lives. Therefore, they claim it is not actually inactivity. As they describe it, refusing to buy insurance is the activity of "self-insurance"&#8212;planning to pay for health care some other way. Similar arguments were made in previous rulings upholding the mandate. These arguments are extremely weak. The fact that most people eventually use health care does not differentiate health insurance from almost any other market of any significance. If you define the relevant "market" broadly enough, you can characterize any decision not to purchase a good or service exactly the same way. Notice that the two judges do not argue that everyone will inevitably use health insurance. Instead, they define the market as "health care." The same bait and switch tactic works for virtually any other mandate.</p>

<p>Consider the famous example of the broccoli mandate raised by Judge Roger Vinson of the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida in <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">striking down</a> the entire health care law. Not everyone eats broccoli. However, we all inevitably participate in the market for "food." Indeed, such participation is even more unavoidable than using health care. Therefore, a mandate requiring everyone to purchase and eat broccoli would be permissible under the federal government's argument. The same goes for a mandate requiring everyone to purchase General Motors cars in order to help the auto industry. There are many people who do not buy cars, but just about everyone participates in the market for "transportation." </p>

<p>The mere fact that people might eat some other type of food does not convert failure to eat broccoli into an activity that can be regulated under the Commerce Clause. Similarly, the fact that a person might acquire health care in some other way does not prove that failure to purchase health insurance is an activity. It also does not vitiate the radical implications of the Sixth Circuit's rejection of the activity-inactivity distinction, since neither actually concludes that congressional power to enact the mandate depends on health care's supposedly special nature.<br />
 <br />
<strong><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Another Defeat for the Federal Government's Tax Clause Claim</strong></div></strong></p>

<p>Although the Sixth Circuit panel upheld the mandate under the Commerce Clause, it rejected the government's claim that the mandate is a valid exercise of the congressional power to tax. Judge Sutton and Judge Graham both conclude that the mandate is actually a penalty, not a tax. Judge Martin avoided addressing this issue directly, but did hold that the mandate is a penalty in the section of his opinion discussing the plaintiffs' standing to sue. So far, the tax argument has been rejected by every judge who has ruled on it, including those who have upheld the law on other grounds. </p>

<p>This unanimous judicial sentiment is correct. As recently as 1996, the Supreme Court reiterated the crucial distinction between a penalty and a tax. It <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7506183234627658013">ruled</a> that "[a] tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for the purpose of supporting the Government," while a penalty is "an exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act" or&#8212;as in the case of the individual mandate&#8212;an unlawful omission. The individual mandate is a clear example of such a penalty: Congress requires people to purchase health insurance and then punishes them with a fine if they fail to comply.</p>

<p>In September 2009, President Barack Obama himself noted that "for us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase." He was right. If the mandate qualifies as a tax, then Congress could require Americans to do almost anything on pain of having to pay a fine if they refuse. It could use this power to force citizens to buy virtually any product, whether it be broccoli, cars, or anything else.<br />
 <br />
<strong><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Prospects for the Future</strong></div></strong></p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit decision and especially Judge Sutton's vote is a clear setback for opponents of the mandate. When and if the case gets to the Supreme Court, the mandate will be upheld if even one of the five conservative justices endorses Sutton's reasoning. The four liberal justices have all consistently refused to impose any meaningful federalism-based limits on congressional power. These dynamics give mandate supporters an important advantage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the serious weaknesses in Sutton's argument make it far from inevitable that the Court's conservatives will endorse it. In his recent opinion for the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16414508289124673813">Bond v. United States</a>, Justice Anthony Kennedy&#8212;a key swing voter in many close cases&#8212;emphasized that constitutional constraints on federal power protect "the liberty of the individual" as well as "state sovereignty." If the Court adopts Judge Sutton's approach to the individual mandate, this crucial aspect of federalism will be gutted. Congress would then have an unlimited power to impose mandates of any kind, thereby undermining any protection federalism might provide against violations of individual liberty by Congress. Whether the justices are willing to bite that bullet remains to be seen.</p>

		<title>New York Marriage Bill Does Not End Legal Discrimination</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pages.citebite.com/i8y3i0y5ycew">Ashley Dunn</a>, Staff Attorney at Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders, argues that despite the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York, legal discrimination remains in the form of federal legislation and the increasing trend of broad religious exemptions...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/ashleydunn.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he efforts of both parties and the tireless work of advocates on the ground which led to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">passage</a> of legislation bringing marriage equality to New York last week must be applauded. It is no doubt an important step forward in the movement. However, we cannot forget the pervasive discrimination that LGBT people, including those who will take advantage of the freedom to marry in New York, still face in its wake.</p>

                <p>While different-sex couples who marry can expect automatic eligibility for spousal protections from many federal programs, including Social Security, family health insurance, and family medical leave, same-sex couples who marry are categorically excluded from these critical legal safety nets because of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between one man and one woman for all federal purposes. There are several ongoing lawsuits challenging DOMA's constitutionality, including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">Gill v. Office of Personnel Management</a>. In that case, Judge Joseph Tauro of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that DOMA's wholesale refusal to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples violates the constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law. The case is currently on <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">appeal</a> in the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. While President Obama and the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">decided</a> they could no longer defend the constitutionality of this blatantly discriminatory law in February, it will remain in effect until repealed by Congress or a final resolution is issued by the Supreme Court.  </p>

                <p>Additionally, across the country, there has been an increasing trend of including ever-expanding religious exemptions within marriage equality and civil union laws, and New York is no exception. Exempting clergy from solemnizing same-sex marriages is harmless, albeit redundant. However, these new religious exemptions propose to do far more&#8212;perhaps more than people tend to realize. The language of New York's marriage equality legislation provides that religiously affiliated and benevolent organizations may take "such action as is calculated ... to promote the religious principles for which it is established or maintained." In essence, the law enshrines discrimination. While it is unclear exactly what the ramifications of such a provision will be, there is concern that it allows religious organizations to choose not to recognize the legal marriages of same-sex couples. For example, a Catholic hospital could choose not to allow a woman to make medical decisions on behalf of her wife, and a Catholic university could deny family medical leave to gay employees.</p>

                <p>Even more troubling is the final clause of New York's marriage equality legislation which essentially works as a "poison pill" for any same-sex couple who would challenge the constitutionality of these discriminatory practices in litigation&#8212;it contains a severability provision providing that if a court declares any part of the legislation to be invalid, the "remainder of this act shall be invalidated" as well. Therefore, if any part of the religious exemption language is successfully challenged in court, marriage equality will disappear in New York.</p>

                <p>Thus, while the passage of marriage equality in New York is a momentous occasion, it does not bring an end to the discrimination faced by same-sex couples in the Empire State.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nicholas Battaglia, Albany Law School Class of 2012, is an intern in the school's <a href="http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=66">Health Law Clinic</a>. He argues that the partisan affiliations of the judges coupled with strong legal arguments will result in more successes for the government in the health care litigation...<hr height="1"><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he constitutionality of the <a href="/feature/2011/06/health-care-reform.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> has fostered much debate, particularly with regard to the individual mandate, requiring every American to maintain health insurance. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">decision</a> of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit finding the mandate constitutional provided the Obama administration with a temporary sigh of relief by finding the individual mandate constitutional as a regulation of interstate commerce. One of the most interesting aspects of this decision cannot be found in its text, but rather in the fact that for the first time a Republican judge, Jeffrey Sutton, broke partisan lines and voted to uphold the law. Until now, all rulings have been dispensed along partisan lines, making it possible to predict the outcome of a case simply by knowing which political party of the president that nominated the presiding judge. Aside from this, with cases pending in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-hears-arguments-in-health-care-law-challenge.php">Third</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">Fourth</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">Eleventh</a> Circuits, it is important to note that the Sixth Circuit's decision stands to be influential in the ongoing litigation. Presently, all three circuits have heard arguments pertaining to the matter, and now, armed with the Sixth Circuit's opinion, one may attempt to hypothesize how the others will come down. </p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit relied on Commerce Clause jurisprudence in its decision, concluding that regulating the practice of self-insurance is facially constitutional, first, because it is an economic activity that substantially affects interstate commerce; and, second, because it is a part of a broader national scheme.  </p>

<p>To support the finding that the individual mandate substantially affects interstate commerce, the court first distinguished the instant case from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778">United States v. Lopez</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">United States v. Morrison</a>, both cases in which the Supreme Court found the link between the activities regulated and the interstate market too attenuated. Here the court took a functionalist approach, making use of national statistics, to reason that the link was not too attenuated because "[s]elf-insuring for the cost of health care directly affects the interstate market for health care delivery and health insurance." The court consequently found that "the practice of self-insuring substantially affects interstate commerce by driving up the cost of health care as well as by shifting costs to third parties." </p>

<p>Next, the court aligned themselves with <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15647611274064109718">Gonzales v. Raich</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685">Wickard v. Filburn</a>, and applied the aggregation doctrine to the effects of non-commercial activity on the overall interstate market. The Sixth Circuit reasoned that in the aggregate, "Congress had a rational basis to conclude that failing to regulate those who self-insure would undermine its regulation of interstate markets in health care delivery and health insurance." Taking a precedential approach, the court looked at cases within the Sixth Circuit, but also at cases in the Fourth and Eighth Circuits, which upheld statutes by finding that failing to regulate non-economic intrastate activity in the aggregate would undermine the efficacy of an overlying interstate regulatory scheme.</p>

<p>Finally, the court addressed the argument that Congress has exceeded its power under the Commerce Clause by regulating inactivity. Acknowledging that the Supreme Court has never resolved this issue, the Sixth Circuit noted that "[v]irtually everyone will need health care services at some point, including, in the aggregate, those without health insurance." In conclusion, the court found that there is no definitive constitutional bar prohibiting Congress from regulating inactivity, and, even if there were, it would not impact this case due to the unique aspects of health care that make all individuals active in the market.</p>

<p><em>Florida v. US Department of Health and Human Services</em> currently sits in the Eleventh Circuit on appeal from Judge Roger Vinson's <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">decision</a> in January, finding the individual mandate unconstitutional. Chief Judge Joel Dubina, and Judges Stanley Marcus and Frank Hull are presiding over the case, two of which were nominated by Democratic presidents. The composition of the bench, coupled with the fact that the government in this case advances arguments similar to those already made by the Sixth Circuit, suggests another favorable outcome for the Obama administration.</p>

<p>In its <a href="http://www.justice.gov/healthcare/docs/florida-response-reply-brief-05182011.pdf">brief</a> [PDF],  the government makes a broader national scheme and substantial effects argument, while also employing the aggregation doctrine and a functionalist approach that uses similar national statistics related to health care costs. It claims congressional Commerce Clause power is valid and that the individual use of the health care commodity has a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market for health care. Additionally, the government's brief tackles the inactivity argument. It posits that paying for health care is inevitable regardless of whether an individual is insured. Essentially, it argues that an individual, who does not purchase health insurance, is gambling whether or not he will need to pay for health care in the future. When he does need to, he will likely not be the only one bearing the cost. While the government's reasoning differs at times from the Sixth Circuit's, the conclusions they draw are fundamentally similar, and in light of the Eleventh Circuit's composition they are particularly likely to be well received.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in fending off Florida's claims the government draws on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11459324010699017963">United States v. Maxwell</a>, which involved a ban on the possession of child pornography. Initially in 2004, the Eleventh Circuit had invalidated the ban. However, after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Raich</em>, the Eleventh Circuit used the broader national scheme rationale and the aggregation doctrine to expressly overturn its earlier decision in <em>Maxwell</em>, reflecting the jurisprudential expansion of congressional power to regulate purely intrastate matters under the Commerce Clause. This argument is identical to the way the Sixth Circuit interpreted the effect of <em>Raich</em> in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16127691265733638987">United States v. Bowers</a>; essentially the Sixth Circuit version of the second <em>Maxwell</em> case. However, it is much more likely to be successful because it shows a clear progression Commerce Clause evolution, particularly in the Eleventh Circuit, and it is likely to be very persuasive.</p>

<p>There are currently two cases concerning health care reform in the Fourth Circuit. However, in <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Liberty University v. Geithner</a>, serious issues of standing must be overcome, making <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">Virginia v. Sebelius</a> the more consequential of the two appeals. The case sits before Judges Andre Davis, Diana Motz, and James Wynn; who were all appointed by Democratic presidents. </p>

<p>Again, the government's brief provides similar arguments to those used in the Sixth Circuit's opinion. The government shares the Sixth Circuit's view that shifting health care costs to other participants in the health care market increases the overall cost of health care. Likewise, they both use national statistics regarding health care costs and draw on <em>Raich</em> and <em>Wickard</em> to justify the argument that the intrastate market has an aggregate impact on the interstate market. However, the government's argument is less convincing than those made in the Eleventh Circuit and by the Sixth Circuit because it failed to bolster its reasoning through a comparison to <em>Maxwell</em>. If a parallel had been drawn to this case, it would have served to explain more substantially how a purely intrastate activity&#8212;possession of child pornography&#8212;could affect the larger interstate market. While the government is certainly still on solid ground, its failure to compare <em>Raich</em> to circuit-specific cases weakened the overall strength of its aggregate argument. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the government did notably distinguish the instant case from <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>. To do so, the government drew on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6430982451238623589">Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States</a>, which established that a purely intrastate business could have an interstate impact. The government furthered this case to establish and explain how the ease of modern transportation has expanded the contours of congressional Commerce Clause regulation. Persuasively, it argues that travel permits individuals to cross state lines for medical care, and even that some hospitals are designated trauma centers for multiple states, but also that illness knows no boundaries and can easily spread to individuals travelling far from home. This is contrary to congressional attempts to regulate what were deemed as purely intrastate activities under the Commerce Clause in <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em>, as they primarily involved local actors and did not implicate issues of mobility or interaction between states.</p>

<p>Overall, the government's brief presents legal arguments in favor of finding the individual mandate constitutional that are on solid ground. With no political barriers to hold them back, and with solid legal reasoning on their side, it is likely that the Fourth and Eleventh Circuits will join the Sixth in finding in favor of the Obama administration. </p>

<p>Another health care reform case, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">New Jersey Physicians, Inc. v. Obama</a>, is on the docket in the Third Circuit. It comes to the court on appeal from the district court's decision granting a motion to dismiss. Similar to <em>Liberty University</em>, the major hurdle for the challengers here is not whether the individual mandate is constitutional, but whether there is standing to litigate. The case is before Judges Michael Chagares, Kent Jordan, and Joseph Greenaway; the first two appointed by Republican presidents, and the last by a Democrat. If the issue of standing is resolved in the plaintiff's favor, for the individual mandate upheld, one of the judges will need to follow the lead of Judge Sutton in the Sixth Circuit. Judge Chagares and Judge Jordan have similar backgrounds. Both have worked for the Department of Justice and have been law professors. However, one could argue that Judge Jordan may be more likely to defect, as he spent time clerking for Judge James Levin Latchum, who was nominated by a Democratic president.</p>

<p>Facing a tough road ahead and a likely circuit split, the individual mandate will probably find itself on the Supreme Court docket for review before long.</p>

Congress has the constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause, a majority of the three-judge panel held, to mandate that most citizens have health insurance or pay a penalty.</p>

<p>As Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the <em>Thomas More Law Center v. Obama</em> opinion, which is rightfully getting the most attention of the three, "[c]all this mandate what you will&#8212;an affront to individual autonomy or an imperative of national health care&#8212;it meets the requirement of regulating activities that substantially affect interstate commerce." While suggesting that he disagrees with Congress's policy choice in this regard, Judge Sutton writes that the government has the better legal argument and that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.03590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> clearly survives a facial constitutional challenge. Holding otherwise and overturning long-standing Supreme Court precedent is not, Judge Sutton wrote, the role of a "middle-management judge."</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A Judge with Solid Conservative Credentials</strong></div>

<p>Judge Sutton's opinion, technically a concurrence though it provides the controlling analysis, is getting the most attention because of who he is and because of how his well-crafted opinion reads. He is the first Republican-appointed judge to uphold the individual mandate. More than that though, Judge Sutton is a highly respected jurist with solid conservative credentials. He clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia and later argued for the states in many states' rights cases.</p>

<p>Another member of the panel, Judge Boyce Martin, would have upheld the individual mandate on a broader rationale, and visiting Senior District Judge James Graham would have struck it down. Judge Sutton's concurrence makes what has been called the conservative case for upholding the law while providing a road map for the Supreme Court to overturn it and precedent cases. Former Reagan administration solicitor general Charles Fried <a href="/forum/2011/06/charles-fried-health-care-ruling.php">described</a> it as a "thorough, balanced and thoughtful," consideration of the challengers' best arguments, and a "devastatingly convincing" decision.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Mandate to Maintain Insurance</strong></div>

<p>The individual mandate is at the heart of the more than two dozen pending lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of the health care reform. In the Sixth Circuit case, the challengers are the conservative Thomas More Law Center and several individual plaintiffs. The individual mandate (also known as the minimum coverage provision) is only one piece of a lengthy and complex law. It is, however, a central piece. It is inexorably linked with other reforms, particularly the prohibition on denying insurance or charging more based on a pre-existing medical condition. The individual mandate is so central that Judge Roger Vinson of the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> that it could not be severed from the rest of the law, and thus voided it in its entirety.</p>

<p>I believe that it is misleading to many in the public, and to the overall debate, that news reports often described the individual mandate as a requirement that everyone will have to buy or purchase health insurance, suggesting that even those who think they are not paying for coverage&#8212;or actually are not&#8212;will have to go out and buy a plan. The requirement, which goes into effect in 2014, requires most citizens to, in the words of the statute; maintain a minimum level of health insurance unless a financial or religious exemption applies. The insurance can be in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, an employer-sponsored plan or individual purchase. It is not uncommon to hear people who are on employer-sponsored plans say that they get insurance "for free," when actually they do pay a portion of the premium, though in the less-visible form of a paycheck deduction.</p>

<p>As a law explicitly drafted to maintain and reform the current, largely private health insurance system, the health care reform law envisions that most people will maintain their current form of coverage. Many of the currently uninsured will be added to the Medicaid rolls, and others will sign up for employer-sponsored plans or buy individual plans. For those who do purchase a plan on the yet-to-be-created insurance exchanges, sliding-scale premium and cost-sharing subsidies will be available if their income is below 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Those who are required to have insurance and do not obtain it will be required to include with their annual federal tax a "shared responsibility payment" of 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per person, whichever is greater.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Substantially Affecting Commerce</strong></div>

<p>The three opinions in the <em>Thomas More</em>, when they address the merits, all focus on Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. (There is no doubt that states have the power to enact an individual mandate, as Massachusetts has done, under their general police powers.) Existing Supreme Court precedent allows Congress to regulate matters, even wholly intrastate, that Congress rationally believes substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>

<p>As in all the health reform cases, the book-end Commerce Clause cases of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685">Wickard v. Filburn</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15647611274064109718">Gonzales v. Raich</a> get a workout.  In the 1942 case of <em>Wickard</em>, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that limited the amount of wheat a farmer could grow for his own use. The Court concluded that this production, though not for sale, did impact interstate commerce because it reduced the amount the farmer would buy and, considering the activities of similar-minded farmers, would impact the total amount grown. More than a half-century later, the 2005 case of <em>Raich</em> once again affirmed an expansive view of the Commerce Clause in a 6-3 opinion. The Court held that the federal government has the power to supersede state law and to prohibit marijuana cultivation, even if grown at home for personal medical use and not for sale.</p>

<p>The intervening years saw the Court giving Congress a wide berth in regulating commerce, all the while maintaining that there are limits, and that the national legislative body does not have unlimited police powers. One limit was set in the 1995 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778">United States v. Lopez</a>, which involved a federal prohibition on guns near public schools, and the 2000 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">United States v. Morrison</a>, which challenged the federal Violence Against Women Act. Both of these were 5-4 decisions overturning the federal laws as beyond the scope of the Commerce Clause because they involved regulation of non-economic, basically criminal activity.</p>

<p>While the Supreme Court has the latitude to revisit its Commerce Clause jurisprudence, Judge Sutton wrote, existing precedent supports the government on this point. "No matter how you slice the relevant market&#8212;as obtaining health care, as paying for health care, as insuring for health care&#8212;all of these activities affect interstate commerce, in a substantial way."  Health-related spending amounted to 17.9 percent of the US economy in 2009, virtually everyone requires health care at some point, and many aspects of it (e.g. medical supplies and medications) are directly linked to interstate commerce. The health insurance market is inextricably linked to interstate commerce.</p>

<p>What of those who "self-insure," either by saving sufficient money for health care expenses or by not saving enough and relying on "good fortune or the good graces of others?" They too substantially affect interstate commerce according to Judge Sutton. (In his opinion upholding the law, Judge Martin also uses the term "self-insure" but stresses that few people have the financial capacity to truly self-insure for the expenses of a major illness or injury.) Congress found that providing uncompensated medical care to the uninsured cost $43 billion in 2008 and much of this cost was shifted to others through higher premiums. Judge Sutton does not address the economic impact, though Judge Martin does, of an insured risk pool skewed towards an older, sicker population when younger, healthier people "self-insure."</p>

<p>"Call this mandate what you will&#8212;an affront to individual autonomy or an imperative of national health care&#8212;it meets the requirement of regulating activities that substantially affect interstate commerce."  Indeed, writes Judge Sutton, <em>Wickard</em> and <em>Raich</em> arguably involved more substantial incursions on the general police powers of the states.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Actively Inactive</strong></div>

<p>The law's challengers argue that there must be a limit to the Commerce Clause's scope, and one limit is that it applies only to individuals already engaged in commerce. Congress can regulate actions or activities, but not inaction, and cannot force people into the market. By definition, they argue, a person who declines to purchase health insurance is not engaging in commerce at all. "Of all the arguments auditioning to invalidate the individual mandate this," in Judge Sutton's view "is the most compelling."</p>

<p>In part it is compelling because Congress has never before regulated in precisely this way. Neither the government nor <em>amici</em> have been able to point to an example of the federal government requiring individuals to purchase a private product apart from other engagement in the market. While the second Congress did require certain men to have a gun and ammunition (even if this meant they had to buy them), this mandate could be seen as a necessary and proper way of implementing Congress's authority to raise an army.</p>

<p>Judge Sutton found the inactivity argument is ultimately unpersuasive for several reasons. As a textual matter, the Commerce Clause does not contain that limitation. Additionally, the Supreme Court has not interpreted it to include such a limitation. Furthermore, in practice the activity/inactivity dichotomy breaks down. Roscoe Filburn and Angel Raich never actively entered any market and yet Congress constitutionally regulated them.</p>

<p>One example he gives regards an individual plaintiff in the <em>Thomas More</em> case who actually now has health insurance but asserts that Congress cannot require her to maintain it. Having now entered the market, has she not taken action, and would she not be doing so by dropping her insurance? "No one is inactive when deciding how to pay for health care, as self-insurance and private insurance are two forms of action for addressing the same risk. Each requires affirmative choices; one is no less active than the other; and both affect commerce."</p>

<p>There might be some individuals who could successfully make an inactivity-based argument once the law is in effect, Judge Sutton wrote, but the case at hand is a facial challenge. To succeed the plaintiffs had to establish that there is no set of circumstances under which the law would be valid. They could not do this.</p>

<p>"That brings me to the lingering intuition&#8212;shared by most Americans, I<br />
suspect&#8212;that Congress should not be able to compel citizens to buy products they do<br />
not want." Could it then also require people to have a health-club membership? Or&#8212;the specter raised by other courts&#8212;buy broccoli? Here Judge Sutton recognizes the government's argument that health care is unique.  "Regulating how citizens pay for what they already receive (health care), never quite know when they will need, and in the case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not be able to afford, has few (if any) parallels in modern life."</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A Broader Affirmance and a Dissent</strong></div>

<p>Judge Martin's opinion goes further than Judge Sutton's and would have upheld the mandate on broader grounds. He concluded that "Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the minimum coverage provision is essential to the Affordable Care Act's larger reforms to the national markets in health care delivery and health insurance." While agreeing with the government that the decision to self-insure is an activity, he stresses that the Commerce Clause does not preclude regulation of inactivity.</p>

<p>The third member of the panel, District Court Judge James Graham, dissented from the majority's Commerce Clause analysis. In his view the mandate must stand or fall on its own, not as a component of the reform law's broader regulation of the health care market. On its own, it "regulates the status of being uninsured," and not economic activity. If the majority's view is correct, he writes, "what aspect of human activity would escape federal power?"</p>

<p>Judge Martin found it unnecessary to address whether the law could also be sustained under Congress's power to tax and spend. Judges Sutton and Graham, however, did address the issue. They conclude that "the individual mandate is a regulatory penalty, not a revenue-raising tax."<br />
	<br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>What's Next?</strong></div></p>

<p>Noting that "we at the court of appeals are not just fallible but utterly non-final in this case," Judge Sutton expressly anticipated Supreme Court review of the law's constitutionality. The <em>Thomas More</em> plaintiffs announced that they will not petition for <em>en banc</em> review and will go straight to the Supreme Court. Will the Court take the case? Will it rule before the 2012 election? Given the importance of the issues and the divided district court opinions thus far, it seems unlikely that the question of the law's constitutionality will ultimately evade high court review.</p>

<p>With all the pending circuit court cases, however, the justices might well wait for at least a couple of those decisions to issue. Two circuits heard arguments on the merits this past spring, and their decisions are expected any time. The Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard</a> cases brought by the Virginia and by Liberty University. The Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">heard</a> the case prominently brought by 26 governors and attorneys general (as well as a business association and a few individual plaintiffs); in addition to the individual mandate, these plaintiffs also challenge the law's expansion of Medicaid and establishment of state-based insurance exchanges. Appeals are pending in four other circuits: the Ninth, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-hears-arguments-in-health-care-law-challenge.php">Third</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Eighth</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">District of Columbia</a>. This latter group includes cases that were dismissed at the district court level for lack of jurisdiction, but the circuit courts could go beyond the jurisdictional questions of standing and ripeness to address the merits.</p>

<p>Perhaps all the other circuits will follow the Sixth and find the law constitutional. Without a circuit split and without a ruling striking down the health care law, there might not be a Supreme Court hearing. Alternately, the Court might grant <em>certiorari</em> in time for a hearing in the upcoming term, and thus a decision by the summer of 2012.  This timing would have resolution before the next presidential election and before the individual mandate provision goes into effect in 2014.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stirring, Essential and Ongoing Debate</strong></div>

<p>With the Fourth of July holiday comes the annual newspaper civics quizzes with their questions about constitutionally based powers and protections. As Judge Sutton articulates, one reason these cases have drawn so much attention is that they bring to the fore important and perennial questions about the meaning of the Constitution, the extent of federal power, and the role of the judiciary in reviewing the policy choices of elected officials.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his opinion, Judge Sutton harkens back to the Supreme Court's 1819 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9272959520166823796">McCulloch v. Maryland</a>, which controversially upheld Congress's authority to create a national bank. "Today's debate about the individual mandate is just as stirring, no less essential to the appropriate role of the National Government and no less capable of political resolution." While Judge Sutton's analysis might not be followed by those who rule on health care reform in the coming months, his cogent, conservative reasoning is sure to be influential.</p>

Still, the fact that about three out of ten Moroccans refrained from voting, as advocated by the organizers of the "February 20" Movement that calls for more profound reforms to Morocco's political system, appears to indicate that not all Moroccans are content with the newly-approved constitutional changes.</p>

                <p>Like most other countries in North Africa and the Middle East, Morocco has been affected by the spread of protests and grass-roots activism known as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a>, which has engulfed the region since the beginning of this year. Unlike some of its fellow Arab countries, the protest movement in Morocco has thus far remained mostly non-violent, a tendency reciprocated by the authorities.  Moreover, the king responded to these protests by initiating the constitutional reforms which promise to enhance democracy and delimit his powers. The king's move should be seen against the background of the last fifteen years of democratic transition, starting during the twilight of the reign of his late father, Hassan II.</p>

                <p>To be sure, even with the latest constitutional reforms, Morocco's democracy remains far from perfect. The king continues to hold the reins of real power and is unlikely to relinquish them, relegating himself to a figurehead.  Morocco's parties, while numerous and vibrant, remain by and large part of the palace-dominated establishment.  Meanwhile, Morocco's youth, the dynamic engine of the protest movement, may remain dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but lacks real power to accelerate it. Whether the momentum of popular pressure to reform will continue after this vote remains to be seen.</p>

                <p>As the future of the region and its peoples remains uncertain, Morocco's example of peaceful and gradual progress towards greater and better-balanced democracy may serve as a positive example for its neighbors and should therefore be endorsed by the international community.</p>

Some say that this is not enough while others say that even this is too much.</p>

<p>My reaction is different. These criminal prosecutions are a significant breach in the <em>omerta</em> of the CIA and other intelligence agencies with regard to their role in the torture. These two prosecutions provide an opportunity for a public reckoning with regard to two particularly egregious cases. These prosecutions provide an opportunity for the defendants and other witnesses to "flip" and provide information to prosecutor John Durham.</p>

<p>Of interest will be to see how these prosecutions go forward. In the face of an indictment, will these defendants plead out to lesser charges in order to make the matter go away? If so, what kind of deal will be cut for them&#8212;a slap on the wrist similar to the Leipzig Trials or more like <a href="/famoustrials/nuremberg.php">Nuremberg</a> or some other form of international criminal tribunal? Will the threat of such prosecution actually going forward loosen the tongues of various persons "in the know" that will now go and speak to Durham as I have asked for some time? Or are the protagonists of the torture silently hoping that we forget about them in their corners around the world?</p>

<p>In the other cases that the Bush, and now the Obama, administrations are trying to quietly put to bed, one should not come to the conclusion that anyone has been exonerated. All that has happened is that the "reliance on legal advice" defense that has been the structural predicate to Durham's investigation has provided the cover that US Attorney General Eric Holder intended. Notwithstanding what torture apologists are always quick to assert, no one is exonerated by these decisions to not prosecute. It is patently obvious from the report issued by the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) and the Margolis report that no one at Department of Justice (DOJ) wants the precedent of a criminal prosecution of the lawyers for their advice on "how to torture without calling it torture." To save the lawyers from criminal prosecution, DOJ appears happy to countenance the torture. That is the box Durham was put in to, and until someone has the guts to go higher that is where America sits. So much for the rule of law.</p>

<p>We must remember that these things sometimes take time for citizens to understand what they have at stake and for more citizens to insist on accountability by the higher ups. Rather than despair, we should embrace this further step forward toward a final reckoning about the torture done in our names. If further persons at the bottom are convicted and punished the fundamental unfairness will be even more apparent than before. I hope the revealing of this unsustainable inequity based on nothing more or less than executive power attempting to preserve itself from accountability helps to change the dynamic. That way we move farther up the ladder to the real perpetrators who instigated these abominations out of cowardice and fear.</p>

<p>Refluat stercus&#8212;make the blame flow uphill, back to the commanders. We are knocking at the doors of the CIA and other intelligence agencies and insisting that they be accountable for their torture crimes. Each time that American citizens do not acquiesce but continue to insist on prosecution of the high level civilians or military generals we strike a blow against the rock of state. We chip away at the certainties of those at the top, making them question how well-founded their actions were, and see their error. We must continue to build the spirit of understanding that will help our leaders see beyond the narrow concerns that animate them today toward the powerful opportunity they have to redress grievous injuries and renew with the best instincts of the human race and America.</p>

<p>We must all recognize that the courage to do the right thing is hard to come by, particularly in an environment where there is a relentless effort by powerful persons (who no doubt see themselves at risk of prosecution) to have us stop resisting their efforts and have us accept torture in our name. However, in all being indomitable and insisting, slowly but surely the tide will turn. These persons will face their accusers and come to understand the shame they have caused for themselves, for their families and friends, for the American soldiers and intelligence community types defending us, and for America.</p>

		<title>Necessary and Proper: Health Care Costs and the Individual Mandate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hillary Stemple, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2012, worked in the health care industry for five years prior to entering law school and is now in the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/juris-doctor/specialized-areas-of-study/health">Health Law Certificate</a> program. She says that the individual mandate must be constitutional as a necessary and proper regulation of commercial activity due to the way in which the growing uninsured population negatively impacts the entire market...<hr height='1'><strong>A</strong>s Americans, we generally abhor being told by our government that we must do something. It is natural for Americans to think, "How can the government force me to purchase health insurance?" Perhaps this is why the individual mandate provision in the <a href="/feature/2011/06/health-care-reform.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) has been so controversial. The idea that the government can compel an individual to purchase health insurance has led to numerous challenges of the PPACA. The argument most frequently used when arguing that the PPACA is unconstitutional is that Congress lacks the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate inactivity, and that <a href="/forum/2011/07/ilya-somin-sixth-circuit-ruling.php">not purchasing health insurance is inactivity</a>. This argument, however, fails upon closer examination of how the health care system, and perhaps more importantly, the health insurance system work in the United States today. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in its <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">opinion</a> upholding the constitutionality of the PPACA, recognized the key fallacy in the "inactivity" argument&#8212;failure to purchase health insurance does not guarantee inactivity with regard to health care. </p>

<p>As of November 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that almost 60 million Americans lacked health insurance. While the morality of allowing so many of our citizens to go without adequate health care access can be debated, what is not debatable is the effect those 60 million people have on the overall cost of health care. The reality is that while these people do not have health insurance, they still become sick or injured and must seek treatment from doctors and hospitals. As the Sixth Circuit stated in its ruling, "[v]irtually everyone requires health care services at some point."  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, health care providers bear a large burden when it comes to providing services to the uninsured. Hospitals receiving federal money in the form of Medicare payments are required by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00001395--dd000-.html">Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act</a> to treat all patients presenting with emergency conditions, without consideration for their insurance status. This means that individuals without insurance will receive hospital treatment, regardless of their ability to pay. While hospitals are allowed to bill uninsured patients for the cost of their care, these individuals often lack the funds to pay for the care they have received, meaning that hospitals are left holding large uncollectable balances for care already given. In 2008, the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals nationally was about $43 billion, or 5 percent of hospital revenue. </p>

<p>A 5 percent drop in hospital revenue can have a large impact, particularly hospitals in lower population density areas that struggle to provide adequate care in their communities while competing with larger health care entities. As a result, hospitals must attempt to make up the lost revenue by raising costs for all patient care in hopes of obtaining higher payments from insurance companies for the care of insured patients. Health insurance companies then pass on the increased costs to the general public in the form of higher premiums. The last part of this self-perpetuating cycle, which leads to the ever-increasing cost of health care in America, is that as insurance premiums rise, more and more individuals are priced out of the insurance market, resulting in a continual increase in uninsured individuals.  </p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that a failure to purchase insurance is not a failure to participate in the health care system, stating, "[v]irtually everyone participates in the market for health care delivery," and "far from regulating inactivity, the [individual mandate] regulates active participation in the health care market." With the PPACA, Congress was not attempting to regulate the inactivity of purchasing health insurance but rather was attempting to regulate the broader health care system.  </p>

<p>The US Supreme Court has a long history, dating back to their ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685">Wickard v. Filburn</a>, of acknowledging Congress's broad powers under the Commerce Clause in regulating economic activity, even activity that may only affect commerce in the aggregate. It would be almost impossible to argue that health care in America is not a commercial activity. In 2009, health care expenditures in the US were nearly 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Clearly, health care is a commercial activity, and in reaching the conclusion that Congress was regulating health care with the individual mandate provision, it is necessary to conclude that the individual mandate is constitutional under the Commerce Clause.  </p>

<p>Even if the Sixth Circuit had found that the individual mandate exceeded Congress's authority, it is likely that the authority for the provision could be found under the Necessary and Proper clause. The Constitution gives Congress the authority to "make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper" for the execution of its enumerated powers (in this case the authority to regulate commerce). With the almost certain conclusion that health care is an economic activity, the individual mandate would need only be essential to the broader regulation to be constitutional.  </p>

<p>The basic nature of insurance is what makes the individual mandate necessary to the broader efforts to regulate health care costs. The basic aims of the PPACA are to lower health care costs in America, and grant more individuals access to health insurance. In order to accomplish these goals, the PPACA places more restrictions on insurance companies to prevent them from denying access to high-risk, or high-cost patients. Basically, the PPACA is opening the doors to all individuals regardless of medical history. In doing this, the insurance companies are going to be taking on individuals with expensive medical needs, making their profits decrease. In order to compensate for the more expensive individuals, insurance companies will be forced to raise their prices, again contributing to the self-perpetuating cycle resulting in a higher number of uninsured individuals.  </p>

<p>However, there is another way to insure the "sick" population, without causing insurance companies to increase costs&#8212;require healthy individuals to purchase insurance as well. When enough "healthy" individuals purchase insurance, they offset the "sick" population the insurance companies are forced to insure under the PPACA. This will stabilize the cost of health insurance, making it more affordable for all. The PPACA relies on the influx of healthy and currently uninsured individuals into the health insurance market to make the overall scheme function. Therefore, the individual mandate is a necessary aspect of the broader health care regulation scheme.  </p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit's opinion was an important first step in settling an issue that will ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court. It provides a strong foundation and a compelling argument for why the PPACA is constitutional.  Hopefully, the Supreme Court will come to the same conclusion.  <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Meyers, Columbia Law School Class of 2013, worked as a staffer to President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009 and later in the US Senate. He argues that although health care reform may fit within current precedent, the Supreme Court must temper its Commerce Clause jurisprudence to strike down the individual mandate... <hr height="1"><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/davidmeyers.JPG" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n his concurring opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778">United States v. Lopez</a>, Justice Clarence Thomas urged the Supreme Court to temper its Commerce Clause jurisprudence "in a manner that both makes sense of our more recent case law and is more faithful to the original understanding of that Clause." After two decades of silence, President Barack Obama's <a href="/feature/2011/06/health-care-reform.php">health care legislation</a> has given the Supreme Court an opportunity to restore common sense to the Commerce Clause.   </p>

<p>In light of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">ruling</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit finding that the individual mandate is a proper exercise of Congress's Commerce Clause power, it is clear that the Supreme Court will have to overturn or temper its case law, especially <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685">Wickard v. Filburn</a>, if it wants to invalidate the individual mandate.</p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit ruling garnered attention because Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a George W. Bush appointee, who wrote the controlling rationale, held that under current case law the individual mandate is constitutional. Judge Sutton's written opinion reveals a judge who felt forced to uphold the law because of the way that Congress and the Supreme Court have distorted the original intent and meaning of the Commerce Clause.  </p>

<p><em>Wickard</em> is the exemplification of the Commerce Clause run amok. In this case, the Supreme Court held that Congress could limit the amount of wheat a farmer produced for his own use under the guise of regulating interstate commerce. On its face, this seems absurd. How can something be part of interstate commerce when it is intended solely for personal consumption? Thanks to then-recent cases, such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1183543472021488573">United States v. Darby</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10553454701062806540">NRLB v. Jones</a>, the Supreme Court held that Congress could regulate anything that "exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce."</p>

<p>This is why from 1937 to 1994 not a single law was struck down for exceeding Congress's Commerce Clause power. The two major cases that struck down Commerce Clause regulations since 1994, <em>Lopez</em> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">United States v. Morrison</a>, were invalidated because they regulated non-economic criminal activity and dealt with criminal statutes. </p>

<p>However, as Judge Sutton notes in his opinion, the health care bill is easily distinguished from <em>Lopez</em> and <em>Morrison</em> since Congress is regulating economic activity because health care costs consume nearly 20 percent of our gross domestic product. </p>

<p>Judge Boyce Martin, who wrote the court's opinion, also cited <em>Wickard</em> when he held that "Congress may also regulate even non-economic intrastate activity if doing so is essential to a larger scheme that regulates economic activity." Clearly, an individual mandate is essential to the health care bill's larger scheme of regulating the health care industry. As the Obama administration has argued, without the mandate people would wait until they were sick to purchase health insurance and the system would be unsustainable.   </p>

<p>Furthermore, under cases such as <em>Wickard</em> and <em>Lopez</em>, Congress can regulate any activity if it has a rational basis for believing that the activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce. Since congressional action almost always passes a rational basis test, and since almost everything that involves economic activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce, the individual mandate appears to be constitutional under current case law.</p>

<p>Therefore, Judge Sutton believed the only choice he had under cases like <em>Wickard</em> was to uphold the individual mandate. According to Judge Sutton, "if, as <em>Wickard</em> shows, Congress could regulate the most self-sufficient of individuals&#8212;the American farmer&#8212;when he grew wheat destined for no location other than his family farm, the same is true for those who inevitably will seek health care and who must have a way to pay for it." A careful reading of Judge Sutton's opinion, however, shows that he is not convinced that the Supreme Court will or should uphold the mandate. The Supreme Court, he writes, "can decide that the legend of Wickard has outstripped the facts of <em>Wickard</em>&#8212;that a farmer's production only of more than 200 bushels of wheat a year substantially affected interstate commerce. A court of appeals cannot."</p>

<p>The argument that the health care bill can be distinguished from <em>Wickard</em> because it <a href="/forum/2011/07/ilya-somin-sixth-circuit-ruling.php">regulates inactivity</a> is not very persuasive. As the Obama administration and Judges Martin and Sutton point out, all Americans at some point are going to use the health care system. Therefore, Congress is not forcing them to buy medical care&#8212;only to regulate how they pay for it and ensure that they pay for it in a way that does not shift costs onto others.  </p>

<p>The only way the inactivity argument might work is through an as-applied challenge, as Judge Sutton suggests. For example, a challenge could be brought by someone who had the money to pay his medical costs out of pocket but was forced to buy health insurance to pay his bills. The plaintiff could argue that this would be similar to Congress telling everyone who drives that they have to buy a particular type of car.  </p>

<p>This argument is still likely to fail because Congress is not forcing this man to seek health care; it is only regulating the manner in which he pays for it. Under current case law, there is a strong argument for the mandate's constitutionality because "the provision regulates economic decisions regarding how to pay for health care that have substantial effects on the interstate health care market."  </p>

<p>As Judge Sutton correctly points out, under <em>Wickard</em> as it is currently interpreted, Congress can force Americans to buy products they do not necessarily want: "is it any more offensive to individual autonomy to prevent [Filburn] from being self sufficient when it comes to supplying feed to his animals than an individual when it comes to paying for health care? It seems doubtful that the Wickard Court would have thought so. See <em>Wickard</em> (acknowledging that the law 'forc[ed] some farmers into the market to buy wheat they could provide for themselves')."<br />
 <br />
If the American people fully understood the case law on this issue, most would agree with Justice Thomas's opinion in <em>Lopez</em> that the Supreme Court's jurisprudence "has drifted far from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause." This drift has not been a positive development. The Commerce Clause has been distorted to give Congress the power to pass a broad set of laws that it may not have the power to enact. The text of the Commerce Clause says that Congress can "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States." The various different tests for what "affects" or "impacts" interstate Commerce are all inventions of the Court, and they have gone too far. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause has given too much power to the federal government and has disrupted our carefully constructed system of checks and balances.</p>

<p>Those who disagree with Justice Thomas must answer the simple question he posed in <em>Lopez</em>: If the Framers intended Congress to be able to regulate anything that "substantially affects" interstate Commerce, why does the Constitution grant Congress the power to enact bankruptcy laws, or coin money and fix the standard of weights and measures, or punish counterfeiters of United States coin and securities, establish post offices and post roads, or to grant patents and copyrights, or to punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas? All of these activities "substantially affect" foreign and interstate commerce. The Framers wrote these provisions into the Constitution because they never intended the Commerce Clause to give Congress the power to regulate everything that substantially affects interstate commerce.   </p>

<p>As Justice Thomas stated in <em>Lopez</em>: "[p]ut simply, much if not all of Art. I, &#167; 8 (including portions of the Commerce Clause itself), would be surplusage if Congress had been given authority over matters that substantially affect interstate commerce. An interpretation of [the Commerce Clause] that makes the rest of &#167; 8 superfluous simply cannot be correct. Yet this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence has endorsed just such an interpretation."</p>

<p>Whether or not the American people support President Obama's health care law, they should hope the Supreme Court takes Justice Thomas up on his invitation to temper its jurisprudence and restore common sense to the Commerce Clause.</p>

Just over the past week, we have seen Ratko Mladic <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">appear for his plea</a> at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague for his role in the Srebrenica genocide, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-files-4-indictments-in-hariri-assasination-investigation.php">indictments</a> handed down for the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri by a UN special tribunal, and International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">arrest warrants issued</a> for Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, his son, and a long time apparatchik of his regime. Not to be outdone, Gaddafi has <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/libya-government-to-charge-21-members-of-rebel-alliance.php">begun his own trial</a>. He is trying some of the opposition government members located in Benghazi, for offering aid and comfort to the enemy (meaning NATO), spreading lies and misinformation, and other matters that sound in treason of one sort or another. This is to say nothing of the apparent collapse of the sexual assault case against former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York, and the subsequent taking up of a similar case against him in France.</p>

<p>There is in fact a consistent theme that runs through these rather disparate international and domestic proceedings. It is the essential element of legitimacy that is a precondition to the effectiveness of a prosecution in assigning criminal responsibility for a wrong. This is not something that can be achieved subsequent to that trial through full and fair proceedings. Take, for example, the New York case as against Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Due to the broad international legitimacy offered to that New York state court and its process, the case was able to proceed without serious interference or challenges respecting its authority. I do not mean by this that some did not find the prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, to be overzealous. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers made precisely this claim even as others defended him as having done what was necessary to ensure that a credible claim made against a powerful man en route to another country could be properly pursued. The legitimacy of the process was not seriously questioned&#8212;not by France itself, where Strauss-Kahn was effectively barred from running for president (at least for the time the prosecution was proceeding in earnest), nor even by Strauss-Kahn himself, who participated fully in the proceedings.<br />
  <br />
Something similar might be said to be happening with respect to the Mladic trial. Though unlike Strauss-Kahn, Mladic appears not to recognize or concede that the tribunal has any authority, indicating in his tirade that they are "not a court." This is probably a view held only by him and some relatively fringe, aging, nationalist contingent of Serbians. It was Serbia, after all, that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">turned Mladic over</a> to The Hague in relatively short order once he was found. Serbians seem more preoccupied with the victory of Serb national Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon than whatever is happening to Mladic. In the end, few think that the perpetrator of the horrors of Srebernica should not be prosecuted, or that this is not the proper tribunal to try him.<br />
  <br />
On the other end of the spectrum of legitimacy, of course, lie Gaddafi's trials against members of the Benghazi opposition council, which nobody other than the party's loyalists could possibly take seriously. Yet what is interesting respecting all three matters is that we judge the legitimacy of the tribunal before it begins, not by the process by which it proceeds. There was no serious question that Strauss-Kahn could not credibly run for president while on bail in New York for an allegation of attempted rape. The conclusion certainly would not have been the same if, for example, he had been arrested in Libya and detained on a charge of treason.<br />
  <br />
This is precisely what makes the Lebanon case so troublesome, and the Libyan case so interesting. In Lebanon, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was created to pursue the assassination of Rafik Hariri. Yet it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/un-security-council-narrowly-approves.php">created</a> over the obvious objection of such a substantial part of the Lebanese population that it never received the approval of the Lebanese parliament, despite repeated efforts to get such approval. Approval was received by only a rump Lebanese cabinet, the six ministers associated with the opposition having resigned well before such approval was sought. Rather than find some sort of solution to create a tribunal that would meet with broad approval of all factions (a daunting task to be sure), the pro-Hariri faction unwisely asked the UN Security Council to approve the tribunal without the parliament's consent, and the Security Council did just that in Resolution 1757. Naturally, not an ounce of legitimacy was afforded to the tribunal by Lebanon's opposition, led by the Shi'i Islamist organization Hezbollah.</p>

<p>There seems to have been a hopeful, but vain, belief on the part of some that if the tribunal could only proceed in a fair and impartial manner, its legitimacy might be earned where it was lacking. If not among Hezbollah's leadership (who might well be resisting a tribunal because of their involvement in the assassination) then certainly among its rank and file. This, it was hoped, might render objections marginal and limited to some extreme contingent, perhaps as is the case with the Mladic prosecution. In scintillating <a href="http://works.bepress.com/melia_bouhabib/1/">commentary</a> in the Berkeley Journal of Middle Eastern and Islamic Law, Melia Amal Bouhabib offers just such hope, along with a series of well considered recommendations on precisely how legitimacy might be earned.</p>

<p>The problem is that once the tribunal is perceived as illegitimate at its start, as any tribunal would be where parliamentary approval for it was sought and then, when it could not be obtained, bypassed by edict of the Security Council, process matters not at all. The Lebanese opposition could not credibly have been expected to participate meaningfully in a tribunal they had successfully opposed if not for Security Council intervention. Instead they have chosen to take their case outside of the court's walls, in a remarkably effective way. Videos are released purporting to show court officials taking bribes, over which dramatic music plays. Hezbollah leaders cite what they allege to be perjured testimony and unreliable witnesses, or offer documentation to the Lebanese government and to the public which is supposed to demonstrate that computers containing investigatory data leaving Beirut for the Netherlands passed through Tel Aviv. In each case, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">response</a> of the tribunal is that such allegations should be made in open court. This is a tactic that no doubt Dominique Strauss-Kahn's lawyers would have adopted in comparable circumstances, but one that given the court's troubling initiation, Hezbollah paid absolutely no attention to on the grounds that the tribunal was too overtly biased to be heeded.</p>

<p>The result has been all too predictable. Indictments have been handed down, and Hezbollah, now part of a governing coalition, has denounced them and refused to cooperate. Meanwhile, the hopelessly divided Lebanese government is almost certainly going to find it difficult to carry them out. Trials will be likely to begin <em>in absentia</em>, with the outside allegations of bias certain to continue, and the results almost certain to be disputed by Hezbollah and its allies.  Even as some will extol the results as being some form of justice done to the late prime minister, others will denounce the entire affair as a politicized Security Council-driven monstrosity designed in a manner that the Lebanese people never approved through their elected representatives. Given that the divisions will not be healed, and the results perceived as illegitimate, it is not precisely clear what the Security Council intervention has managed other than to insert the international community into the middle of an intractable domestic dispute.</p>

<p>It is worth keeping the unfortunate results of Lebanon in mind as the work of the ICC proceeds in Libya and elsewhere.  That is, clearly the Security Council mandate has achieved little in Lebanon to create tribunal legitimacy. It would be unfortunate if similar Security Council authority was misused in the future, or rather so selectively used as to cast the legitimacy of the entire ICC into jeopardy. I do not mean to suggest that this has occurred, but that the danger should be borne in mind.</p>

<p>The source of the danger lies in the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> of the ICC, which has a rather narrow prescription of jurisdiction, limiting it for the most part to specified international crimes either (i) occurring in States which are parties to the Statute or in which a national of such a State is a Party or (ii) referred to it by the Security Council. To put the matter starkly, if China&#8212;not a member to the Rome Statute and with veto power in the Security Council&#8212;were to engage in a broad genocide of Tibet's population (no intention to suggest that this is at all within China's contemplation, and offered only by way of illustrative hypothetical), the ICC would lack jurisdiction entirely. The same would not be true if a government without a permanent seat in the Security Council were to kill dozens of protesters in a rally, and the Security Council were to refer the matter to the court for resolution. This disturbing discrepancy is scarcely defended by those earnestly engaged in the work of international criminal justice but rather justified as a necessary compromise to political realities. Thus, at a <a href="http://www.news.pitt.edu/news/justice-norwegian-supreme-court-deliver-pitt-s-19th-annual-mclean-lecture-world-law-a">talk</a> at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, former head of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and Norwegian Supreme Court Justice Erik M&#248;se eloquently and accurately indicated in response to such a criticism from an audience member that such problems do exist, but that they should not detract from the serious work that international tribunals do.</p>

<p>Yet such a justification only goes so far, namely to the extent that the well-intentioned, professional and serious participants in the system are generally believed to be engaged in the necessarily imperfect exercise of ensuring that justice be brought about for some of the world's most notorious crimes. To the extent that these courts are understood to be nothing more than the (well-intentioned) legal enforcement wing of the Security Council, less engaged in justice and more in pursuing selectively chosen political enemies for prosecution while ignoring allies whose crimes are no less great, the grave threat to legitimacy thereby arises.</p>

<p>So far, the Security Council has acted judiciously. It is true that both the Arab League and the African Union offered <em>pro forma</em> denunciations of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">indictment</a> of Sudanese President Omar Hassan Bashir, and suggested political motivations for the charges brought against him. Yet the crimes of which he is accused&#8212;relating to genocide in the Darfur&#8212;are of a sufficiently serious nature that no credible claim of excessively selective prosecution can be made. As a result, as one who has done a great deal of work in the Arab world, I do not perceive much interest in the matter among Arabs, and certainly none of the fury that erupts among many Arab Shi'a, and in particular Lebanese Shi'a, when the Hariri investigation is raised.<br />
  <br />
Libya, however, begins to present a much closer case. The problem is not so much the indictments of Gaddafi and his son themselves. They have been brutal and are unloved by Arab leader and layman alike, so much so that the Arab League took the extraordinary step of <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/arab-league-calls-for-un-no-fly-zone-over-libya.php">requesting</a> NATO intervention. The problem, rather, is that they seem to be the only individuals who have been so selected for prosecution despite the widespread repression that has arisen in response to the Arab Spring across the region. Why, Bahraini Shi'a ask, is it that there is no suggestion that some of Bahrain's leadership is not referred to the Security Council for any number of <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">human rights violations</a>, including the use of live fire ammunition on protestors leading to dozens of deaths, widespread arrests and detentions of individuals opposed to the regime who are then denied access to family and lawyer alike, and the inception of military trials against everyone from doctors to students that reputable human rights organizations have maintained lack credibility?   Perhaps more saliently, given the higher number of deaths from government violence, what of Syria's fierce <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-groups-urge-icc-probe-into-syria-protest-deaths.php">repression</a>, severe enough that even Amnesty International has suggested referral to the ICC? It is one thing, after all, for justice to be imperfect, another not to even be pursued so long as one has a friend with veto power on the Security Council.<br />
  <br />
To be clear, I do not believe that the legitimacy of international criminal justice is under any sort of imminent threat. I do think, however, that as its work expands and as the Security Council intensifies its role in referring matters to it, these sorts of problems are likely to become thornier. As such, the lessons of Lebanon will be useful to keep in mind.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.tjsl.edu/faculty_m_cohn">Marjorie Cohn</a> of Thomas Jefferson School of Law says that all instances of torture must be investigated as violations of US and international law and a failure to do so will allow impunity for those who authorized these actions... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/marjoriecohn.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>P</b></font>resident Barack Obama declared "nobody's above the law" in 2009, as Congress contemplated an investigation of torture authorized by the Bush administration. However, Obama has failed to honor those words. His Justice Department proclaimed its intention to grant a free pass to Bush officials and their lawyers who constructed a regime of torture and abuse. US Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that his office <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/06/doj-to-investigate-2-overseas-detainee-deaths.php">will investigate only two instances</a> of detainee mistreatment. He said the department "has determined that an expanded criminal investigation of the remaining matters is not warranted." Holder has granted impunity to those who authorized, provided legal cover, and carried out the "remaining matters."</p>

<p>Both of the incidents that Holder has agreed to investigate involved egregious treatment and both resulted in death. In one case, Gul Rahman froze to death in 2002 after being stripped and shackled to a cold cement floor in a secret American prison in Afghanistan known as the Salt Pit. The other man, Manadel al-Jamadi, died in 2003 at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. He was suspended from the ceiling by his wrists, which were bound behind his back. Tony Diaz, a military police officer who witnessed al-Jamadi's torture, reported that blood gushed from his mouth like "a faucet had turned on" when al-Jamadi was lowered to the ground. These two deaths should be investigated and those responsible punished in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>The investigation must also have a much broader scope. More than 100 detainees have died in US custody, many from torture. Untold numbers were subjected to torture and cruel treatment in violation of US and international law. General Barry McCaffrey said, "We tortured people unmercifully. We probably murdered dozens of them during the course of that, both the armed forces and the C.I.A."</p>

<p>Detainees were put in stress positions, including being chained to the floor, slammed against walls, placed into small boxes with insects, subjected to extremely cold and hot temperatures as well as diet manipulation, blaring music, and threats against themselves and their families.</p>

<p>At least three men were waterboarded, a technique that makes the subject feel as though he is drowning. Pursuant to the Bush administration's efforts to create a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times. Abu Zubaydah received this treatment on 83 occasions.</p>

<p>US law has long recognized that waterboarding constitutes torture. The United States prosecuted Japanese military leaders for torture based on waterboarding after World War II. The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002441----000-.html">US War Crimes Act</a> make torture punishable as a war crime.</p>

<p>Lawyers in the Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush, including John Yoo and Jay Bybee, wrote the torture memos. They redefined torture much more narrowly than the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> and the War Crimes Act, knowing interrogators would follow their advice. They also created elaborate justifications for torture and abuse, notwithstanding the absolute prohibition of torture in our law. When the United States ratified the Convention Against Torture, it became part of US law under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The convention says, "No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of  torture."</p>

<p>Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Yoo have all said they participated in the decision to waterboard and would do it again. Thus, they have admitted the commission of war crimes. Major General Anthony Taguba, who directed the investigation of mistreatment at Abu Ghraib, wrote, "there is no longer any doubt as to whether the [Bush] administration has committed war crimes. The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account."</p>

<p>Taguba's question has been answered. None of those lawyers or officials will be brought to justice. Outgoing CIA Director Leon Panetta said, "We are now finally about to close this chapter of our agency's history."  Ominously, David Petraeus, incoming CIA Director, told Congress there might be circumstances in which a return to "enhanced interrogation" is warranted. That means torture may well continue during Obama's tenure. This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Not only is torture illegal; it does not work and it makes people outside the US resent us even more. High-level interrogators such as FBI agent Ali Soufan have said the most valuable intelligence was obtained using traditional, humane interrogation methods. Former FBI agent Dan Coleman agrees. "Brutalization doesn't work," he said. "Besides that, you lose your soul." </p>

Upholding the district court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">dismissal</a> of the challenge, the court ruled 2-1 that the individual mandate is a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. Perhaps most surprising was Judge Jeffrey Sutton's concurrence upholding the mandate. A former clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered one of the leading conservative jurists in the country. Many are hailing Sutton's opinion as an admirable example of non-partisan judicial reasoning because of this reputation.</p>

                <p>In reality, Judge Sutton's opinion is an unfortunate blend of factual supposition and judicial abdication. While seeming to call out the Supreme Court for failing to articulate a significant and meaningful limit on federal power, Sutton simultaneously engages in a type of reasoning that would eviscerate any such limit. Sutton makes two crucial errors in what is otherwise a masterfully crafted opinion: he consistently reads the "substantial effects" doctrine (the outermost bound of federal power in this area) as solely requiring economic calculation, and he defends a hypothetical statute rather than the one Congress actually passed.</p>

                <p>First, Sutton observes that all types of paying or not paying for health insurance&#8212;"self-insuring," assuming the risk, purchasing insurance when sick, not purchasing insurance at all, etc.&#8212;would have a substantial effect on the economy if aggregated. He thus concludes that every one of these decisions, and non-decisions, is subject to federal regulatory authority. This reasoning, which the government has pushed throughout the various health care lawsuits, cannot exist in a system of limited and enumerated federal powers. That is because the Commerce Clause, even under modern jurisprudence, does not base Congress's power on the object of the regulation's having surpassed some economic threshold.</p>

                <p>As Judge James Graham observes in dissent, "Without question, forcing all individuals to purchase a product that not everyone would otherwise purchase will have an affect on commerce. But Congress cannot be tolerated to justify its exercise of power by creating its own substantial effects. In determining whether the substantial effects test is satisfied, the focus must be on the existing economic activity Congress seeks to regulate, not on the impact that the regulation would have." In other words, the limits on Congress's power must be principled rather than circumstantial. They derive from an analysis of the kind of activity or status being regulated, not just the effects that activity or status may have on the economy. No one opposing the individual mandate on constitutional grounds has ever argued that the failure to purchase health care, in the aggregate, does not have substantial effects on the economy. Yet that is the straw-man that Judge Sutton knocks down.</p>

                <p>Second, Sutton defends a hypothetical statute rather than the one Congress actually passed. The government has been using this bit of smoke and mirrors too, but again you should pay attention to the man behind the curtain. Sutton argues that the individual mandate only regulates the method and time at which health care is purchased. No part of health care reform, however, addresses that question. The law does not ask people to purchase insurance once they need care or seek to shift the cost of care onto others. Instead, the mandate compels individuals to engage in commerce regardless of whether they receive health care services. Moreover, it is insurance that is the object of regulation, not the provision of health care. As Judge Graham points out, "the mandate does not regulate the commercial activity of obtaining health care. It regulates the status of being uninsured."</p>

                <p>Sutton's analysis obfuscates the unprecedented constitutional significance of the statute by characterizing it as just another insurance regulation. He treats differences in kind (e.g., not purchasing insurance or entering into commerce) as differences in degree (e.g. it is not whether you will purchase health care, but when). Making this subtle shift facilitates the constitutionally corrupt analysis of the substantial effects doctrine described above.</p>

                <p>When Sutton dismisses the activity/inactivity distinction proposed by challengers to the individual mandate, he similarly addresses a hypothetical statute. He asks, for example, whether it is "inactivity" to require a person already holding insurance to maintain that coverage. Again, that is not the regulation at issue in this litigation. Because some individuals in the health care market may be subject to regulation by some narrower law does not affect the question of whether it is constitutional for others to be regulated by a broader law. To hold otherwise is to imperil all facial challenges to broadly sweeping laws.</p>

                <p>Perhaps most upsetting, however, is how Judge Sutton's analysis purports to be following precedent while admitting that the individual mandate is unprecedented and that no Supreme Court decision speaks directly to its constitutionality. Sutton curiously feels obliged to "respect the language and direction of the Court's precedents" rather than enforce a principled limit on federal power that already exists in the case law.</p>

                <p>The best that can be said about Sutton's deciding vote is that it essentially asks the Supreme Court put up or shut up: "the Court either should stop saying that a meaningful limit on Congress's commerce powers exists or prove that it is so." Unfortunately, Sutton himself had the ball on this question and an open field in front of him, yet decided to punt.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On April 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/04/sec-charges-goldman-sachs-with.php">filed</a> a civil action against Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. for the structuring and marketing of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO). The synthetic CDO, a complex financial security used to speculate or manage the risk that an obligation will not be paid, was tied to the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities sold to investors in early 2007 when the US housing market began to show signs of distress. According to the SEC complaint, these types of synthetic CDOs contributed to the financial crisis by magnifying losses associated with the downturn of the housing market.

Undisclosed in the marketing materials prepared by Goldman, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc., a large hedge fund, with economic interests directly adverse to investors in the CDO, played a significant role in the creation of the CDO. After this, Paulson effectively bet against the mortgage-backed security it helped create by entering into credit default swaps, a form of insurance that protects the lender in case of loan default, with Goldman to protect itself against losing its investment in the CDO. Given this, Paulson had an economic incentive to create a CDO which included securities that it expected to default in the near future. Goldman did not disclose Paulson's adverse economic interests or its role in the creation in the marketing materials provided to investors. That is, Goldman arranged a transaction at Paulson's request in which Paulson heavily influenced the creation of the CDO to suit its economic interests, but failed to disclose to investors Paulson's role or its adverse economic interests.

The deal closed on April 26, 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately $15 million for structuring and marketing the CDO. By October 2007, 83 percent of the mortgage-backed securities in the CDO had lost value and the remaining 17 percent were soon to follow. By January 2008, 99 percent of the portfolio had followed suit. As a result, the CDO's investors lost over $1 billion, and Paulson yielded a profit of approximately $1 billion.

The SEC alleged that Goldman had engaged in misconduct and also directly or indirectly engaged in transactions, acts, practices and a course of business that violated Section 17(a) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2A_20_I.html">Securities Act of 1933</a>, Section 10(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2B.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm">Exchange Act Rule 10b-5</a>. The SEC sought injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, prejudgment interest, civil penalties and other appropriate and necessary equitable relief.

Shortly after filing the complaint, the SEC and Goldman <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">agreed</a> to a settlement approved by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York whereby Goldman would be permanently restrained and enjoined from violating the Securities Act in the offer or sale of any security, disgorge $15 million, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $353 million to Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the SEC. At the same time, the settlement imposed strict conditions upon Goldman in establishing a product review committee and adopting a series of compliance mechanisms in order to prevent Goldman from repeating this practice.

While it may not seem relevant at first glance, the Goldman case provides a revealing analysis of the economic crisis plaguing Greece as unregulated Wall Street practices affect smaller nations vulnerable to market fluctuations. In April 2010, Bethany McLean <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/opinion/27mclean.html">argued</a> the credit crisis in the US was the result of congressional inaction to curb the frenzy of easy loans, the refusal to regulate derivatives and the repeal of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/FullTextTheGlass-steagallActA.k.a.TheBankingActOf1933">Glass-Steagall Act</a>, which separated investment from commercial banking, without making further adjustments in the regulatory scheme.

Here is how it all worked: Deregulation of the US financial industry allowed commercial banks to underwrite and trade instruments such as the mortgage-backed securities and CDOs (at the heart of the Goldman case), and to establish structured investment vehicles that purchased those securities. Naturally, and in the spirit of increasing profits, banks and other financial institutions began to invest in government bonds and housing securities, fueling the unprecedented growth in the US housing bubble. Following this, all bets were on for the large financial institutions and the wizards of Wall Street as the free market provided fertile ground for hedging on default.

What is remarkable is the fact that Wall Street financiers continued to generate billions in profits by structuring and selling such securities when the US was experiencing depression-like market conditions in 2008-2009, and Congress was debating <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">legislation</a> to re-regulate certain sectors of the financial industry. Just for illustrative purposes, the top 10 hedge fund managers in the US made over $11.6 billion in profits in 2008 and over $22.5 billion in 2007. AR Magazine reported the following profits: James H. Simons, Renaissance Technologies, $2.5 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2007; John Α. Paulson, Paulson &amp; Co., $2.0 billion in 2008 and $3.7 billion in 2007; John D. Arnold, Centaurus Advisors, LLC $1.5 billion in 2008 and $480 million in 2007; George Soros, Soros Fund Management, $1.1 billion in 2008 and $2.9 billion in 2007.

In February 2010, it was reported that major hedge funds in the US were repeating this treatment of the housing market by betting that the euro would fall to parity with the dollar, representing significant potential profits for the funds. Richard Parker, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/05/01/wall_streets_game_of_risk_with_greece/">explained</a>:
<blockquote>As 2010 began, the Street's 'best and brightest' saw what suddenly looked like a new source of even easier money, playing what insiders like to call "The Headline Risk Game" on little Greece. Here's how it works: Greece's recovery, like our own, still looks pretty shaky—but, for Headline Risk players, that's an opportunity to bet against their recovery, then pounce when the inevitable bump in the recovery road appears. Their payoff comes as weaker investors rush out of the market for bonds, leaving Greece unable to borrow—and potentially forced to default. (Default, for Headline Risk players, can promise even bigger profits.) ... Central to Wall Street's 2008 nose dive were the billions wagered in credit default swaps—the cheap derivatives-based bets with lottery-size payoffs that speculators had placed on US homeowners. Today exactly the same sort of swap bets are what Wall Street has placed against Greece in their Headline Risk Game—and right now we're looking at what could become a replay of the same disastrous consequences. ... Had Washington closed off credit default swaps—and similar derivatives-based betting—from this sort of pernicious gaming of global financial systems, this appalling risk of European meltdown could have been avoided.</blockquote>
In February 2010, hedge funds increased their bets on Greece's economic troubles by shorting its bonds or buying default protection. Even hedge funds without direct exposure to Greece have been insulating their portfolios against collateral damage in the currency or credit markets given the concerns that Greece may not be able to service its heavy debt.

In summary, the economic crisis in Greece is partly the result of the meltdown of its social entitlement programs, the vastly unproductive central authority and the public companies that have been operating at significant losses over many years. Yet, the development and marketing of complex financial instruments by Wall Street strategists and the deregulation of the banking and investment sectors in the US during the Clinton administration have opened the floodgates of profits for a select group of investors who can affect credit events around the globe with the push of a few buttons. Therefore, the economic crisis in Greece cannot be linked to failed domestic policies alone, but must be viewed in the context of the legalized bets placed by financiers who stand to make billions when, and if, Greece defaults; and there is nothing illegal about that in an unregulated financial world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Rivera Marinero &amp; Carmina Castro [Legal Researchers, <a href="http://www.fusades.org/">Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development</a>]: Recently, UN Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers Gabriela Knaul <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-expert-warns-new-el-salvador-law-harms-judicial-independence.php">warned</a> that an El Salvador law requiring its high court to issue unanimous judgments was an "attack" on judicial independence and the separation of powers. The pressure continues to build since both parties continue with a confrontational stance, regardless of the clamor from Salvadoran and international civil society groups. Members of the National Assembly continue to consider the removal of the justices, while the four justices criticize the role of President Mauricio Funes in this debacle. The law Knaul was referring to, passed on June 2, 2011, is National Assembly <a href="http://www.diariooficial.gob.sv/diarios/do-2011/06-junio/02-06-2011.pdf">Legislative Decree No. 743</a> [PDF], which established that in constitutional cases the decisions of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court must be unanimous. </p>

                <p>This change, replacing the majority rule system, was introduced in last minute changes to the agenda, and using waiver procedures. President Mauricio Funes signed it into law within a few hours, and sent it to be published by the Official Journal on the same day. Furthermore, since the reform is to have temporary effects until July 31, 2012&#8212;which is the date when one third of the Supreme Court will be renovated&#8212;it came into effect immediately after its publication, foregoing the regular eight-day <em>vacatio legis</em>. In sum, the executive and legislative branches contrived to limit the power of the judiciary.</p>

                <p>The urgency of this reform had a particular motivation: to prevent the Constitutional Chamber from making further rulings. Since the appointment of Belarmino Jaime as President of the Constitutional Chamber and the Supreme Court, and of Florent&#237;n Mel&#233;ndez, Edward Sidney Blanco, and Rodolfo Gonz&#225;lez Bonilla as justices of the Constitutional Chamber for 2009-2018, the "Fantastic Four" have produced several controversial constitutional rulings. The cases have related to electoral law, budget transparency, citizen security, and media, among other sensitive issues that have challenged the status quo, and that have affected both the executive and legislative branches. Justice Nestor Castaneda, who has served in the Chamber since 2003, has consistently voted against the majority in these controversial decisions. Therefore, the reform aims to give this justice an effective veto power. </p>

                <p>The law has been strongly <a href="http://www.observatoriolegislativo.org.sv/attachments/article/1405/2c_101_2011.pdf">rejected</a> [PDF] by Salvadoran civil society organizations, who have asked the National Assembly to abolish it in a petition signed by close to 2000 citizens. This led the main opposition party to <a href="http://www.observatoriolegislativo.org.sv/attachments/article/1393/16a_100_2011.pdf">declare</a> [PDF] that it had been a mistake to approve the decree. However, the rest of the representatives are not willing to support their proposal to repeal the legislation. Not even the majority party, who initially opposed the law, is willing to support the repeal of the legislation. </p>

                <p>For several weeks, the institutional crisis has become more severe. The Constitutional Chamber has declared Decree No. 743 unconstitutional, and has proceeded to issue decisions with four votes. Evidence has surfaced that the law voted by the legislature is not the same as the one sanctioned by the president, which would render the law unconstitutional. The Official Journal&#8212;an agency of the Executive&#8212;<a href="http://www.observatoriolegislativo.org.sv/attachments/article/1427/carta%20imprenta.pdf">refused</a> [PDF] to publish the ruling of the Constitutional Chamber, asserting that the Constitutional Chamber did not comply with the requirement of a unanimous vote, but the Official Journal did not have any legal foundation for taking this decision. </p>

                <p>In recent weeks, the National Assembly received a motion to remove the four justices from office on the basis that they have committed a criminal offense in disregarding the unanimity vote rule. Following this, the Political Commission announced that it would dismiss the petition. However, the Political Commission did decide to continue its discussion on the matter.  During the legislature's plenary session there were negotiations to remove the justices from the Constitutional Chamber immediately. </p>

                <p>These developments present a grave challenge to El Salvador's democracy, unprecedented since the Peace Accords of 1992. Civil society is behind the "Fantastic Four" but it is not clear that the political class is willing to accept an independent Judiciary that will limit its power. El Salvador's political analysts have coined the term "partydocracy" to describe the system that has been in place since the Accords. Let us hope that this crisis is the interlude to a consolidation of a citizen's democracy.</p>

To be sure, that issue never reached the Supreme Court because California (like other states that have argued unsuccessfully for regulation of graphic violence) simply conceded that such games were protected under the First Amendment. Nonetheless, had anyone wished to question this long-settled premise, a fascinating debate could well have been revived and some striking differences among electronic media might well have re-emerged.</p>

<p>A brief historical and personal footnote may anchor this discussion. Thirty years ago, I rashly offered in a keynote speech to the Wisconsin State Bar to address the status of video games. The context was quite different in those early days; Mortal Kombat and its progeny lay far in the future as young gamers relished such seemingly simplistic challenges as PacMan, Brick-Breaker and the like, demanding what today seems quite limited skills. What was startling to me in the summer of 1981 was not the prospect of regulating violence but the disdain with which my proffered topic was greeted by my fellow Wisconsin attorneys and judges attending the annual conference.  </p>

<p>Why, they asked, would anyone ever seriously confer First Amendment protection on so clearly unmeritorious a medium? Video games, they insisted, were just for kids, and besides were pure entertainment, devoid of any worthier content. Undaunted, I pressed on, noting that new media of any type merit constitutional protection until and unless a recognized exception to free speech preempts it. Moreover, as even a PacMan fan would have recognized, the video industry was already quite creative both in designing and marketing new electronic games. Clearly those who had already created and programmed such games, and the systems to test young players' skills at the controls, deserved copyright if not constitutional protection. Finally, even the early video games were no worse than pure entertainment in more traditional forms. Yet as my family and I left Lake Geneva that Saturday night, I vowed revenge to my skeptical Badger colleagues.</p>

<p>At that time, few if any legal scholars deemed video games serious enough to warrant constitutional recognition. Only the Interactive Digital Software Association (as it was then called) seemed to care in the least, and it could have been viewed as tainted by a tinge of self-interest. I believed, however, that their position was sound, and thus began collaborating, long before such media groups became fashionable with more elegant names like Video Software Dealers Association and Entertainment Software Association. A few courts in the mid to late 1980s reluctantly conceded that video games might possibly merit First Amendment protection, leaving for the moment the seemingly harder question whether violent content deserved stricter regulation to protect young viewers. By the 1990s, a few venturesome scholars began developing the shell of a constitutional claim for the video industry.</p>

<p>All this now evokes ancient history. No court in the last decade and a half has voiced any doubt that video games deserved First Amendment protection, leaving possible doubts only as to whether violent content could be analogized to sexually explicit imagery for purposes of shielding minors. Justice Scalia, in his forceful majority opinion in the recent  <em>Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association</em> case, declared unequivocally that "new categories of unprotected speech may not be added to the list by a legislature that concludes certain speech is too harmful to be tolerated." None of the justices, even the two dissenters, had any reservations about this central premise.  </p>

<p>Thus, as one commentator noted a few days ago, the <em>Brown</em> judgment is "<a href="/forum/2011/06/roy-gutterman-video-games.php">an electrifying decision</a>." What is truly "electrifying" is how far the court has come this term by unanimously finding First Amendment protections for video games. The appealing analogy between regulating violent video games, for example, and banning animal cruelty videos, is surely defensible on First Amendment grounds but is far from obvious. Conveniently overlooked within that analogy were such compelling factors as the special regulatory interest in protecting minors and the solicitude (embraced by Justice Alito alone) for helpless animals. Thus, the convenient leap from the ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">United States v. Stevens</a> to <em>Brown</em> simply subsumed potential dissonance in the interest of pervasive protection for freedom of expression as a core constitutional concept.</p>

<p>In fact, a Court that is now fully committed to free speech conveniently avoided a couple of potentially confusing byways. Within the last decade, the justices in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2729037874515332053">Virginia v. Black</a> did in fact "add [at least one] new category of unprotected speech" in sustaining the substance of Virginia's cross burning law in so much as it was designed to prevent intimidating speech. While invalidating various types of hate-speech laws, the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14621372290934958371">RAV v. St. Paul</a> strongly resisted pressures that have been irresistible in other developed countries (such as bans on anti-Semitic, sexist, racist and homophobic speech). Perfect consistency would, of course, have relegated cross-burning laws to similar invalidation,  yet we know that did not happen. We have just now learned that Mortal Kombat creators enjoy a strong measure of First Amendment protection that intimidating cross-burners apparently may not claim. The analogy is far from perfect, in either direction, but does seem to warrant a degree of consistency that escapes the untrained eye.</p>

<p>Finally, let me make clear that I fully applaud the Court's ruling in the video game case. As the author or co-author of several <em>amicus</em> briefs in the federal appeals courts, and ultimately in the Supreme Court, on this very issue, I would endorse Justice Scalia's conviction that violent entertainment may not be regulated or banned, under a proper standard of strict scrutiny, for the reasons and in the manner that California and other states have done. Additionally, I would resist the qualifications and exceptions embraced by the two concurring justices. A clear majority of the Court has, moreover, categorically foreclosed any form of comparable or parallel regulation. For those of us who, three decades ago, claimed similar recognition for early entries like PacMan and Brick-Breaker, this is seems a welcome if far from inevitable outcome.</p>

		<title>Wilders Acquittal is the Best Outcome</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gerolf Hagens [Human Rights Section, <a href="http://www.kaveity.nl/">Kaveity and Kaveity</a>]: Recently, the Royal Dutch Court of Amsterdam <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/dutch-court-acquits-politician-in-hate-speech-case.php">rendered a verdict</a> in the case against Geert Wilders. In a <a href="/hotline/2011/04/the-trial-against-geert-wilders.php">previous submission</a>, I wrote that it was going to be very interesting to see whether the court would accept the claim Wilders made, that he&#8212;as a politician&#8212;should be able to say the things he was trailed for.</p>

                <p>Even though many people expected Wilders to acquitted, there were still a number of people that seemed to be very sure that he would in fact be punished for what he said. The main argument used was based on the fairly similar case of <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=867478&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Le Pen v. France</a>, before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), where it was decided that freedom of expression does not protect discriminatory statements and that politicians have a greater responsibility when it comes to what they say; a politician cannot say things that discriminate against a part of their society. </p>

                <p>The Dutch court, however, after a very irregular and fairly long-lasting trial, decided that what Wilders said cannot be seen as hate-speech, as offending people on the basis of their religion, or as encouraging people to discriminate against others on the basis of their religion. The court gave two main arguments for this decision.</p>

                <p>First, the court decided that Wilders did not offend people on the basis of their religion, nor did he encourage people to discriminate against others on the basis of their religion because Wilders never said anything about Muslim people, but about the Islamic religion. Offending a religion, or a religious entity, is officially forbidden under Dutch law, but has been accepted for a very long time. The court said that Wilders's statements qualified under this prohibition, but in practice it is no longer a punishable offense. However, once it intends to cause hate or discrimination against a group of people on the basis of their religion, it goes too far. With some of Wilders's statements, the court said, he reached the outer limits of the law without going over.</p>

                <p>The fact that people feel offended by what Wilders said does not mean that it was intended to insult them. Since it was aimed at the religion and not the people following this religion, this was not a punishable offense. </p>

                <p>One can have doubts about the validity of this argument. A characteristic of a religion is that people follow it. It is these people that make the religion what it is. Making such a distinction between the religion and the people following the religion does not do justice to reality. Yet there are arguments to support this idea as well, seeing as remarks aimed against the religion, are not necessarily aimed at the people following the religion and the fact that someone feels offended, does not necessarily mean the person saying seemingly offensive things can (or should) be blamed for this. </p>

                <p>When it came to the question whether a politician should have more leeway in expression to contribute to the public debate about a certain issue, the court referred to the ECHR case of <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=852547&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">F&#233;ret v. Belgium</a>, where it was decided that a politician should in fact have more room to say things that "offend, shock or disturb," but there has to be a "pressing social need" to say these things and they must be proportional. The court did not say much about this, but applies this principal combined with Dutch law to conclude that there had been no violation of the law. </p>

                <p>With that, this trial ends. Only the public prosecutors can appeal this decision, but have no reason to do so as they have said since the start that they did not think Wilders was guilty. However, the people that forced the trial have decided to go to the UN to fight the decision, claiming that the Dutch government has not done enough to protect minorities.</p>

                <p>From a legal point of view as well as from a political one, this was the best possible outcome. In legal sense there were no compelling arguments to prosecute Wilders, as was already concluded by the public prosecutors. The earlier mentioned <em>F&#233;ret</em> case was clear on the fact that a politician has the right to say things that can be considered shocking or offensive, which is what Wilders did. Yet, what he said was not discriminatory. There is no doubt in that people considered it to be discriminatory, but the fact remains that most of the offensive things he said were aimed at the religion and not at a group of people. </p>

                <p>The <em>Le Pen</em> case, brought up by those who claim that Wilders should have been convicted, cannot support this either. In this judgment it was concluded that the European Convention on Human Rights was not violated when Le Pen was convicted for&#8212;among other things&#8212;racism. That is where there is a major difference with the underlying case: Wilders was not convicted under Dutch law. While it can be said that on the basis of this judgment a conviction would not be a violation of his freedom of speech, it cannot be said that an acquittal is thus a violation. </p>

                <p>On a political basis, this was the best outcome as well. Politicians have to be able to say things that bother their listeners. There are approximately 1.5 million people who voted for Wilders, and most of them do so because of their fear, and perhaps hatred, towards people of the Muslim faith. As careful as any (modern) country has to be with in that regard, especially in light of Europe's past, the issues that matter to these people is important too. The fact that the group this speech is aimed at is offended does not mean that such an opinion cannot be expressed. This is especially so when the speech is not about the group of people personally, but their religion or religious customs, it would go too far to convict someone for expressing such an opinion. </p>

                <p>That said, and as the court expressed, Wilders does go very far with some of the things he says. Minorities, whether religious or ethnic, have to be protected. So while Wilders, and anyone else, should be able to say anything about any religion, when it comes to saying things about groups of people, he will have to keep in mind that it is also his role as a politician to protect minorities. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Schaeffer, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2012, is spending the summer working for a firm specializing in energy law. He writes on Marcellus exploration and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, specifically considering the implications of Pittsburgh's decision to ban the practice at the municipal level...<hr height='1'><strong>T</strong>he practice of hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking in the industry, has been covered everywhere from the nightly news to <em>The Colbert Report</em>. Although some news reports make fracking seem like a recent development, it has actually been in use for over 50 years. Fracking is a process where drillers inject a high-pressure mix of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground to loosen rock formations and release oil or natural gas. In the last five years, fracking has been used to release gas in shale formations across the country, including one of the country's largest shale formations&#8212;the Marcellus in Appalachia. From a single well pad, drillers can extend several wells out horizontally through the Shale formation&#8212;some as long as 8,000 feet. Whereas exploiting these formations was previously uneconomical, higher natural gas prices and better drilling technologies have made the Marcellus commercially attractive. While it varies from state to state, landowners with oil and gas rights are receiving anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 signing bonuses per acre and 12.5 to 18.5 percent royalty rates on any gas produced. Last year alone, it is estimated that Marcellus-related activity added billions of dollars to Pennsylvania's economy.</p>

<p>Job creation and tax payments in a recession sound great. So what is the fuss? Opponents of Marcellus exploration allege that hydraulic fracturing has negative impacts on the environment and public health. The primary concern is that chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing will leak (or worse, be dumped) into watersheds. A secondary concern is that the fracking process itself releases methane gases trapped underground that will seep into the water supply. The movie <em>Gasland</em>, by Pennsylvania film director Josh Fox, purports to show this methane contamination in shocking detail, and plaintiffs in two recent Pennsylvania cases allege groundwater contamination as the result of fracking operations. Other concerns include noise and air pollution from the wells, fracking's high water use, and increased truck traffic.</p>

<p>New York has reacted to these perceived threats by extending its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing for another year, in addition to suing the Delaware River Basin Coalition and the Army Corps of Engineers. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, has issued several thousand Marcellus permits, and former Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hangar has been outspoken about the safety of natural gas exploration. In contrast to New York and Pennsylvania, West Virginia's response has been that of inactivity. Marcellus specific legislation failed to pass during the last regular legislative session, and West Virginia's new interim governor, Earl Ray Tomblin, has yet to call for a special legislative session.</p>

<p>This has led to the perception that hydraulic fracturing specifically, and Marcellus exploration in general, are unregulated at the federal and state level, and municipalities in the Appalachian region have responded accordingly. In November 2010, Pittsburgh became the first major American city to outlaw hydraulic fracturing within city limits. Buffalo, New York, followed Pittsburgh's lead in February of 2011. Most recently, Morgantown, West Virginia, has responded to drilling activity outside its city limits by considering a ban of its own on hydraulic fracturing.</p>

<p>However, the question remains, how do these municipalities justify regulating an activity&#8212;oil and gas exploration&#8212;that is almost exclusively regulated by states and the federal government? Referring to the actual text of these ordinances, it is clear that water contamination is the primary concern of these municipalities. Where the municipalities differ, however, is in how they justify the passage of these ordinances. Pittsburgh and Morgantown are representative of two different approaches. This article will discuss Pittsburgh's ordinance, as Buffalo's ordinance is moot and Morgantown's has yet to take effect.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh's <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/district5/assets/marcellus/2010_aug17_Marcellus_Bill.pdf">Community Protection from Natural Gas Extraction Ordinance</a> [PDF] is remarkable for both the authorities it cites and those it does not. Pittsburgh bases its authority to regulate natural gas extraction on the inherent right to self-governance established by the Declaration of Independence and on Article 1, Section 2, of the <a href="http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html">Pennsylvania Constitution</a>, which states "[a]ll power is inherent in the people." Interestingly, the ordinance cites neither Pittsburgh's home rule powers under Pennsylvania law nor the Natural Resources Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which states "[t]he people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment." Instead, the rights established by the Natural Resources Clause are alluded to in the statements of law setting forth a right to water and rights of natural communities.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh's decision to ground the ordinance in constitutional rights, rather than statutory home rule powers is likely the result of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5453647091719823783">Range Resources Appalachia, LLC v. Salem Township</a>. In Salem Township, the Court held that Salem's ordinances regulating surface and land development related to oil and gas drilling were preempted by the <a href="http://www.dep.state.pa.us/dep/deputate/minres/oilgas/act223.htm">Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Act</a>. Pittsburgh anticipates a similar preemption challenge in Section 5 of the ordinance. Section 5.3 attempts to preclude corporations (which in Section 5.2 are told that they will not have the rights of "persons") from enforcing state or federal preemptive law against Pittsburgh or from challenging or overturning any ordinances adopted by the Pittsburgh City Council. Finally, the ordinance attempts to render invalid any permit, license, privilege or charter issued by any state or federal agency if it would conflict with the ordinance's terms.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh's ordinance is breathtaking in its audacity (and its unconstitutionality). Even if one forgets that the ordinance is almost certainly preempted by state law, as held in <em>Salem Township</em>, there are multiple constitutional deficiencies. First, denying corporations the right of "personhood" implicates various issues of due process and equal protection. Second, and perhaps most clearly, the ordinance violates Pennsylvania's Certain Remedy Clause. Article 1, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution states: "All courts shall be open; and every man for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law, and eight and justice administered without sale, denial or delay. Suits may be brought against the Commonwealth in such manner, in such courts and in such cases as the Legislature may by law direct." By prohibiting corporations from challenging the ordinance, Pittsburgh is blatantly violating Pennsylvania's Certain Remedy Clause.</p>

<p>This, however, reflects an interesting tactical choice. Generally, municipal ordinances in home rule states receive a presumption of validity upon review. Courts further apply a presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments. Thus, Pittsburgh's ordinance puts potential challengers in a bind. If a corporation brings a preemption claim, Pittsburgh can state that this remedy is excluded because the corporation is not a "person" for purposes of standing, the corporation is specifically excluded from challenging the ordinance or attempting to enforce preemption law. Assuming that the court quickly disposes of these arguments as unconstitutional, the plaintiff must then argue that Pittsburgh lacks the power to enact the ordinance or that it is otherwise preempted. Pittsburgh grounds the ordinance in constitutional rights, however, giving it two arguments. First, Pittsburgh can argue that it is not trying to regulate in the same area as the legislature (oil and gas) since its ordinance is directed toward public health and safety. Second, Pittsburgh can argue that the ordinance is not inconsistent with state law, and thus not preempted, because it advances state constitutional goals of self-governance and natural resource conservation. A corporate plaintiff is thus in the unenviable position of having to argue that Pittsburgh does not have recourse to or has misapplied these constitutional rights or that these rights are nevertheless preempted.</p>

<p>Any challenge will result in a show trial, and even where Pittsburgh loses (and it will lose), the forces behind the ordinance win (and the taxpayers footing the legal bills lose). Pittsburgh will be able to challenge the rights of corporations and the idea of corporate personhood, and testimony about the safety of hydraulic fracturing will allow the city to call doomsday experts. This is just in the courts of law. The court of public opinion will likely have even less relation to fact, with confusion about preemption doctrine devolving into a personification of the evil corporation exploiting state laws and connections to deny the will of local voters.</p>

<p>With all of the potential negatives and the relative lack of Marcellus exploration in Pittsburgh's Allegheny County, it is not surprising that no one has challenged Pittsburgh's ordinance. If and when the challenge does come, however, it could set the stage for a fascinating and protracted legal battle.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/directory/steven_schwinn.shtml">Steven D. Schwinn</a> of The John Marshall Law School in Chicago says that the health care litigation has provided a forum for novel Tenth Amendment and federalism claims, which were properly ignored by the Sixth Circuit in its recent ruling upholding the individual health care mandate...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stevenschwinn.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">ruling</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>Thomas More Law Center v. Obama</em> garnered a lot of attention for what it said about congressional authority. The holding, that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to require the purchase of health insurance notwithstanding the activity, inactivity distinction advocated by the plaintiffs, was the right one. The opinions by Judge Boyce Martin and Judge Jeffrey Sutton explain why this is the case (although for somewhat different reasons) in some of the clearest and plainest terms seen so far.</p>

<p>Despite the clarity of Judge Martin's and Judge Sutton's opinions, this case is as important for what it did not say. In particular, the case did not say a lot about the Tenth Amendment, "states' rights," or even more abstract principles of federalism. To be fair, the parties did not press these issues hard. However, some <em>amici</em> <a href="/hotline/2011/07/shapiro-burrus-health-care.php">argued</a> that these form an important limit on congressional authority. They argued that the Tenth Amendment and federalism principles cabin Congress's power and keep it appropriately bound. This argument is an important back-end complement to the plaintiffs' argument-in-chief, that Congress exceeded its limited authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>

<p>This argument is entirely novel. Advocates for this position, both in this case and outside it, argue that congressional authority is limited and constrained, as opposed to merely defined (which could be quite large, depending on the definition). Their principal argument is that the language of the Commerce Clause reflects the limitations; they find further evidence of limits in the Tenth Amendment and federalism principles. There is no support for such a constrained government in the constitutional text or our history or practices. There is, however, overwhelming support for a defined, but not necessarily small, federal government. Advocates therefore work to infuse their libertarian ideals into the Commerce Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and animating federalism principles through brute force and repeated activist claims in litigation like this. They believe that by repeating their claims, and getting courts to adopt them one-by-one, they can slowly but surely reshape the bounds of federal power in the libertarian image. Make no mistake: these claims are an effort to redefine the very meaning of the Constitution in this case and beyond.  </p>

<p>The Sixth Circuit properly declined to conspire in this effort. In particular, it declined to take the bait on the novel Tenth Amendment and federalism claims. No judge on the panel, not even Judge James Graham, who wrote that the individual mandate exceeded congressional authority, spent much time on these issues. In fact, when the other two judges considered these issues, they roundly rejected these novel arguments in this case, other cases, and the broader public debates. The case thus not only rightly rejected the purported distinction between activity and inactivity under the Commerce Clause, but it also properly rejected the activist attempts to craft a more robust Tenth Amendment&#8212;one that has no support in the Tenth Amendment text, history, or jurisprudence.  </p>

<p>One argument is that the Tenth Amendment acts as a federalism limit on congressional authority&#8212;that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from intruding too far into areas traditionally reserved to the states. This is not what the Tenth Amendment says, however, or what it meant to the framing generation. Instead, the Tenth Amendment simply reserves to the states those powers not granted to the federal government. This only says what we all know to be true in a system of dual sovereignty: with a federal government of defined powers, what the federal government cannot do, the states can. In other words, the Tenth Amendment only takes us back to the Commerce Clause question of whether Congress could enact the individual mandate in the first place.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Court has recognized federalism limits on congressional authority. In both <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778">United States v. Lopez</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">United States v. Morrison</a>, for example, the Court expressed some concern that Congress might go too far into areas of traditional state authority. This is a loose, ill defined concern, especially in an era when it is harder and harder to identify particular enclaves of traditional state control. The Court's ruling in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15647611274064109718">Gonzales v. Raich</a>, and even its ruling just last term in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">United States v. Comstock</a>, holding that Congress has authority to detain "sexually dangerous" federal prisoners beyond their original sentence, underscore just how much the lines of authority between the federal government and the states overlap. The Sixth Circuit properly rejected claims that the individual mandate goes too far into an area of traditional state control.  </p>

<p>Another argument is that the Tenth Amendment prohibits Congress from commandeering citizens. This misreads both the text and the Court's jurisprudence. The Court tells us that the Tenth Amendment only forbids Congress from commandeering states and their officials, not individual citizens. In fact, the federal government commandeers its citizens in all kinds of ways&#8212;from paying taxes to registering for selective service&#8212;that are not barred by the Tenth Amendment. It does not matter that Congress commandeers us under its other, non-Commerce Clause authorities: if the Tenth Amendment prevents commandeering citizens, it would prevent commandeering under any authority because it is an independent restriction on anything the government does. The commandeering principle simply does not apply to individual citizens. The Sixth Circuit again properly rejected this novel claim.</p>

<p>A final argument is that the Tenth Amendment prevents Congress from interfering with states' rights to protect their own citizens from the individual mandate. <em>Thomas More Law Center</em> did not involve this kind of claim, because states did not bring the case, but this claim has formed the backbone of other, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">state-initiated litigation</a> against the health care law. This argument goes to the newly enacted and reactionary <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/voters-consider-laws-seeking-to-bar-health-care-mandate-in-arizona-colorado-oklahoma.php">laws</a> in several states that prohibit any requirement that their citizens purchase health insurance, which were used to make a political statement against the individual mandate and to manufacture standing for themselves in federal court to challenge it. This argument is not supported by the text, structure, history, or jurisprudence. Instead, the Tenth Amendment simply reserves to the states those powers not granted to Congress. For those powers granted to Congress, however, the Supremacy Clause means that federal law preempts contrary state law. This argument becomes circular, merely taking us back to the question of whether Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause in the first place.  </p>

<p>Plaintiffs in this and other cases, and other opponents in the public debates, have all made novel Tenth Amendment and federalism arguments as part of their challenges to the individual mandate. These have not received the same attention afforded to the Commerce Clause argument, but they are every bit as important, and they are every bit as novel&#8212;without basis in text, history, or jurisprudence. The cases challenging the individual mandate have thus invited the courts to give new shape to the Tenth Amendment and federalism principles&#8212;a shape that reflects the opponents' radical and ahistorical view that the Constitution enshrines libertarianism and creates a government of limited and constrained powers. The Sixth Circuit, by largely not addressing these claims, properly declined this invitation.</p>

<p>On July 13, 2011, just before 7pm, explosions erupted in three separate crowded business districts in Mumbai, India.  Initial reports counted at least 21 dead and one hundred wounded. Mumbai is no stranger to terrorist attacks. In 1993, a series of bombings killed approximately 260 people. In 2006, Islamist militants <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-detains-hundreds-in-mumbai.php">bombed commuter trains</a> killing over 180. New Delhi has long claimed that Pakistan's military and Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) has aided attacks on Indian soil, including a previous <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">attack in 2008</a>, where militants killed 166 people in Mumbai during a 60-hour siege. Islamabad swiftly condemned the bombings; only time will tell whether it is merely coincidence that the chief of ISI, Ahmed Shuja Pasha, left for Washington the same day as the attack.  </p>

<p>What has emerged from the controversy over the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">"targeted killing"</a> of Osama Bin Laden and domestic and international concerns about the capability (or ineptitude) of Pakistani military and governmental agencies is increased indications of human rights abuses as well as the very significant and fundamental realignment of multilateral political and military relations underway. These conditions may profoundly affect not only US relations with Pakistan, and operations in Afghanistan, but multilateral relations with China, India and security beyond those borders.  </p>

<p>Pakistan is an important foothold for the US in the region, and an important staging point for operations against the anarchistic border of Afghanistan. However, continued aid to Pakistan may well have become both illegal and politically imprudent. In summer 2011, amongst other prior occasions, the State Department had expressed concerns to Congress over major human rights problems in Pakistan, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances and torture. If founded, further funding would be prohibited under the so-called "Leahy Law."  Initially appearing as part of the 1997 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ208/html/PLAW-104publ208.htm">Foreign Operations Appropriations Act</a>, the law then applied only to the State Department's International Narcotics Control (INC) program. It was broadened in fiscal year 1998 to include all security assistance programs funded through the Foreign Operations Act. Then, in fiscal year 1999, it was extended to include training programs authorized under Defense Department appropriations, and was also included in the 2001 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ429/html/PLAW-106publ429.htm">Foreign Operations Appropriations Act</a>. The law governing foreign operations covers both training and assistance (such as weapons grants), and the Leahy Law in the 2001 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ259/html/PLAW-106publ259.htm">Defense Appropriations Act</a> covers training, together prohibiting aid to military units that have committed gross violations.</p>

<p>The egregious nature of these violations is compounded by the Pakistani removal of top US military trainers from their soil, limits on visas for US personnel, and the arrest of key intelligence contacts who helped lead to the location and killing of Bin Laden. These facts, along with an impending budget crisis, have set the conditions for the US to recently suspend $800 million of a $2 billion dollar defense-spending package to Pakistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters on July 11, 2011, that the suspension "does not signal a shift in policy but underscores the fact that the partnership with Pakistan depends on cooperation." The rewards for such cooperation have been ample for Pakistan in the recent past: US annual bilateral aid to Pakistan went from $5.3 million in 2000 to $798 million in 2002 to more than $4.4 billion in 2010. More than two-thirds of the total $20.73 billion appropriated assistance over the past eight years has been security-related aid. Additionally, the US has appropriated $1.5 billion in annual non-military aid totaling $20 billion in assistance to Pakistan since 2001, including $8.87 billion in reimbursements. Facing financial and political pressure to crack down on domestic terror from both Washington, D.C. and New Delhi, it is curious how Islamabad remains so emboldened in its behavior. </p>

<p>This all must be considered in light of Pakistan's ties with China. These ties go back to the 1950s, when Pakistan was among the first countries to break ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan and recognize the legitimacy of the People's Republic of China on the mainland. Both the countries support each other on foreign policy and military defense issues as well. The <a href="http://www.kashmir-information.com/LegalDocs/SinoPak.html">Sino-Pakistan Agreement</a> was a 1963 document between the governments of Pakistan and China establishing the border between those countries. Under its terms, China supports Pakistan on the Kashmir border dispute with India, while the latter supports China in the ongoing issues of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tibet">Tibet</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>. On April 6, 2005, China and Pakistan signed a treaty for friendly and neighborly co-operation, pledging to upgrade their strategic partnership to an even higher level. China lauded the fact that the two countries also signed a dozen other accords, including those on fighting terrorism, extremism and separatism, and on an early harvest program of a free trade agreement.</p>

<p>Scholars have identified the primary purpose for the close relationship between China and Pakistan. Lisa Curtis of the Heritage Foundation testified May 20, 2009, on this very matter before a congressional hearing of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. Curtis observed: "Chinese policy towards Pakistan is driven primarily by its interest in countering Indian power in the region and diverting Indian military force and strategic attention away from China." Towards this end, Pakistan and China reached a broad-based agreement in 2006 to strengthen their military-to-military cooperation, to help each other protect their sovereignty, territorial integrity and national independence. The full ramifications of this agreement are still unknown, especially considering the contradictory 1954 US-Pakistan Mutual Defense Agreement, and Pakistan's membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and Central Treaty Organization (CENTO).</p>

<p>With China fully committed to using Pakistan as a proxy to advance its interests against India, the US seems to be at a crossroads. The delicate nature of this multilateral relationship makes the US's next step critical. For example, by diving into a full-fledged commitment to the stability of India or by invoking Leahy's Law, the US risks what little goodwill it has with Pakistan, thus placing operations in Afghanistan in jeopardy. Further, this kind of commitment risks straining relations with China, the repercussions of which are, at best, unpredictable. On the other hand, reinstating support to Pakistan will further fund a government whose interests are rarely in sync with, and more often contrary to, the interests of the US. China will continue to benefit from the destabilizing effect Pakistan has on India and India's march toward western-approved progress might become staccato.</p>

<p>Zalmay Khalilzad, former US ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, recently suggested ways in which the US should be offering "more carrots along with the sticks" in the multilateral relationship among Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China and the US. Among other measures, these might include "expanded [International Monetary Fund] and bilateral assistance" and "a major, multilateral diplomatic effort to mediate disputes among Afghanistan, Pakistan and India," leading to "an India-Pakistan peace and normalisation process." If Pakistan's "intransigence" persisted, Khalilzad said, the US would have to consider closer security ties with India "as part of a containment regime against Pakistan."</p>

<p>The multidimensional foreign policy chessboard has been set for some time and it is yet again the US move, consistent with domestic and international law. The events of July 13, 2011 simply serve to reinforce which side the players are on.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.villanova.edu/Our%20Faculty/Faculty%20Profiles/Richard%20Booth.aspx">Richard Booth</a> of Villanova University School of Law says that courts should stop certifying securities fraud class actions, as they compound the loss to stockholders and other methods could be utilized to deter corporate fraud and more effectively provide restitution to all affected stockholders...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/booth.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>S</b></font>ince 2005, the Supreme Court has rendered eight decisions&#8212;two just this year&#8212;in securities fraud class actions. These suits were brought on behalf of investors who had bought stocks at prices allegedly inflated due to the false corporate statements. All of these cases arose under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=103382197bc864922d6a7939da394d75&rgn=div8&view=text&node=17:3.0.1.1.1.1.58.71&idno=17">Rule 10b-5</a>, the catchall anti-fraud rule. These do not include cases involving initial public offerings, insider trading or any other form of securities fraud. Rather, in each case, disappointed stock buyers sought compensation from the issuer company for losses suffered due to sudden decreases in the stock price after the false statements were revealed.</p>

<p>The number of stock-drop cases taken by the Court is remarkable because each year it decides fewer than one hundred cases. However, this follows the Court's practice of choosing cases where the lower courts are confused about the law, as is the case in securities fraud class actions. The Court has ruled that in these cases only the affected stock buyers have standing to sue. Since the company (or its insurer) pays in the event of a buyer's successful suit, it is the other stockholders who effectively bear the cost. In other words, stockholders pay buyers, but those who sold their stock before being affected by the stock-drop keep their gains.</p>

<p>This circularity is bad enough, but it gets worse. Since the company pays, stockholders effectively lose twice&#8212;first from the decline in stock value because of the bad news itself, and second from feedback&#8212;the further decline in stock price attributable to the payout to the buyers. Moreover, because the prospect of a payout increases the amount of loss, it increases the amount of the class claim, which further increases the loss, and so forth. Mercifully, the process reaches a mathematical limit depending on the size of the plaintiff class. In addition, the stock price may fall further because of securities litigation costs, possible fines and due to the reluctance of future investors.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that a share of Vandelay Corporation trades at $20 on expected earnings of $2 per share. Unbeknownst to the market, a major customer has cancelled a contract, and earnings are instead likely to be $1.50 per share. Nevertheless, the CEO reassures the market that business is good. In the absence of the cover-up, one would expect stock price to fall from $20 to $15 when the truth comes out. However, because management lied to the market and the company will likely have to pay a class action settlement, the stock price falls further, perhaps to $10. Some of the additional decrease may also be attributable to the market's perception that Vandelay is riskier than previously thought.</p>

<p>In a securities fraud class action, buyers can individually recover their entire loss&#8212;$10 per share&#8212;assuming of course that they prove their case. Except for the first $5 of loss, it is the corporation that suffers the harm. One would think that the corporation (if anyone) should recover for the benefit of all the stockholders. Instead, individual buyers recover, and the remaining stockholders effectively lose twice.</p>

<p>The first $5 of loss, which affects all stockholders, is going to happen&#8212;fraud or no fraud. Thus, it is not really a recoverable loss. Although one might try to justify securities fraud class actions as a form of investor insurance, most investors are effectively insured anyway because they are well diversified by virtue of investing through institutions such as mutual funds and pension plans that hold more than two-thirds of all stock. A diversified investor is just as likely to gain from the sale of an overpriced stock as to lose from the purchase of one.</p>

<p>Although an undiversified investor might be happy to forgo some return as a fee for such insurance, the costs of securities litigation, including attorney fees and management distraction, are a deadweight loss that serves only to reduce aggregate investor return. The bottom line is that a securities fraud class action perpetuates the loss that it seeks to recover, with a remainder that is not really a loss at all.</p>

<p>More importantly, diversified investors lose when they are mere holders of a fraud-affected stock&#8212;which is the case for most affected investors. Most investment advisers agree that a buy-and-hold strategy makes the most sense for most investors. However, consider how a diversified buy-and-hold investor might fare in a class action. If most, but not all, of the investor's shares were purchased before the false statement, the investor would prefer that the class action simply be dismissed. To be sure, the law provides that one can always opt out of a class action. It does no good for the investor to opt out though, since this would forgo any recovery at all. Thus, the investor will reluctantly file a claim in the class action despite his preference for the action's dismissal. The cure is worse than the disease.</p>

<p>Federal securities law is supposed to serve the interests of reasonable investors. Given that reasonable investors diversify and follow a buy-and-hold strategy, it is difficult to see why the law provides a class action remedy in such circumstances. The law requires that the plaintiff in a class action must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. No one can do so if most of the class would oppose the action. Accordingly, the courts should decline to certify most securities fraud actions as class actions. The obvious retort is that in the absence of a class action remedy, there would be no effective deterrent to this type of securities fraud because the SEC does not have the resources to pursue every individual claim in an enforcement action. There are several responses to this.</p>

<p>First, since class actions compensate investors for harms that can be hedged away with diversification, and because class actions cause the stock price to fall more than it otherwise would, class actions constitute excessive deterrence for securities fraud. Although one might argue that we should deter fraud however we can, too much deterrence makes managers reluctant to speak at all. Presumably, investors want as much information as they can get, and they are willing to accept an occasional mistake if it means more information.</p>

<p>Second, there are other forms of deterrence. As noted above, investors may suffer a genuine loss if the value of the corporation is reduced by civil fines and other expenses of litigation or an increase in the cost of capital. These losses are suffered by all of the stockholders&#8212;not just those who stand to recover. Thus, the corporation has a claim for compensation against the individual wrongdoers causing the original stock-drop through false statements. If the corporation declines to sue, a stockholder may sue derivatively on behalf of the corporation. If the action is successful, the corporation recovers, and stockholders are effectively compensated for that portion of their loss without causing further losses due to feedback. The only element of loss that remains is the loss that was going to happen anyway. However, a diversified investor is protected against that sort of loss. Thus, if the corporation recovers, the stockholders are restored to where they would have been in the absence of fraud. Herein lies yet another reason why the courts should decline to certify securities fraud class actions. The law requires that a class action be superior to other methods of fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. There is no doubt that a derivative action is the superior way to litigate such cases.</p>

<p>The mystery is why stock-drop actions have survived at all. Legal scholars have cooked up all sorts of reasons why they might make sense. The fact remains that stock-drop actions make sense only for the lawyers by increasing the size of the claim and the corresponding attorney fees. So why is it that defendant corporations do not argue that they should recover from the individual wrongdoers? One obvious answer is that a derivative action pits the corporation against its own officers. In a class action, corporation and management can circle the wagons against a common foe. Moreover, insurance may not cover a claim by the corporation against its own officers.</p>

<p>Still, none of this explains why an index fund would not come forward to oppose class certification and argue that a derivative action is a superior remedy. The implication for an index fund&#8212;which trades primarily for purposes of portfolio balancing&#8212;is that the fund may recoup its losses to the extent that it is a buyer of a fraud-affected stock but it will lose to the extent that it is a holder of the same stock. In most cases, an index fund will be a holder as to many more shares than the number of shares bought during the fraud period. It may be that when a fund receives a big settlement check, no one thinks to ask how much has been lost in the bargain.</p>

<p>Ironically, the Supreme Court recently ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores</a> that it is inappropriate in a class action for injunctive relief to award damages to individual class members. A derivative action is in fact a class action for injunctive relief, compelling the corporation to sue. It is more than a procedural nicety in a securities fraud action that recovery should go to the corporation and not individual buyers. Not only does the corporation pay when buyers recover, but the corporation is also denied any recovery for the losses it suffers. It is time to clean up the mess of securities fraud class actions, but it is not clear that anyone is motivated to do the job.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Suto, Syracuse University College of Law Class of 2013, is the President of the Syracuse chapter of the American Constitution Society and recently moderated a panel discussion on the issue of WikiLeaks and the Constitution. He writes on how the US Supreme Court must begin to engage in public diplomacy through its rulings...<hr height='1'><strong>T</strong>he reasons for the American Revolution were submitted to a candid world in the Declaration of Independence. Later, these values were enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. These distinctly American works are among the most influential legal documents of the modern era. Nonetheless, over the course of two centuries that once candid world has changed greatly. The influence of the US, both legally and otherwise, has waxed and, more recently, waned. However, if the US wishes to maintain its position as one of the world's leading legal systems, the nation's Supreme Court could stand not only to be more cognizant of the impact its decisions have in legal systems all over the world, it could stand to work to maximize that impact.</p>

<p>To enhance American legal influence, the Supreme Court must engage in what can be termed as public diplomacy. Public diplomacy can be defined as the image of a state or its people, as maintained by a government, organization or people. As such, the Court should endeavor to facilitate the understanding of its decisions, which are used to explain and test US legal values the world over. The world currently faces challenges that are inherently global in nature. For example, the legal questions associated with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a>, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a> and Internet neutrality and censorship, are all matters that transcend borders. While the international nature of these issues proves political and legal isolationism faulty, hard power intervention also has grave shortcomings. As such, the Court's ability to indirectly apply legal force and influence presents itself as an attractive alternative, and it should be maximized accordingly. </p>

<p>The US has its greatest potential for influence in nations drafting new constitutions, forming new governments and otherwise attempting to progress and modernize. In these countries legal foundations are often still being set, making them more likely to look to foreign decisions for guidance and precedent. The fact that many foreign courts have cited US Supreme Court opinions demonstrates their influence beyond US borders. For example, quite recently India's Supreme Court found a constitutional right to counsel, citing many Supreme Court decisions as precedent. In its own precedential <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-supreme-court-finds-constitutional-right-to-counsel.php">decision</a>, the Supreme Court of India wrote, "[i]n our opinion, a criminal case should not be decided against the accused in the absence of counsel. We are fortified in the view we are taking by a decision of the US Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=370328547336451678">Powell v. Alabama</a>." The Court further cited <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=694784363938594707">Gideon v. Wainwright</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8803339074305789315">Brewer v. Williams</a> in its holding.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, foreign court decisions that cite to the Supreme Court have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/world/americas/17iht-18legal.16249317.html">generally declined</a>. This likely reflects either a decreased foreign interest in the US legal system or the US's decreased interest in public legal diplomacy. Either way, it remains important that the US recover its jurisprudential influence, as this is a tool too valuable to lose. </p>

<p>First Amendment protections in general and freedom of speech in particular, provides an illustration of how the Court may utilize public diplomacy to expand the influence of the US legal tradition. In legal terms, the US has only arrived at its current approach to the First Amendment in the last 50 years, and the meaning of those 45 words is still evolving. However, in that time the US has been at the forefront of developing human rights such as freedom of expression and individual liberty. During the twentieth century these legal principles have been our greatest and most valuable export. For example, the Court expressed the extensive protection of speech and acts offered by the First Amendment in its 1989 decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2084618710761560217">Texas v. Johnson</a>. In <em>Johnson</em>, the Court held that the First Amendment protected the burning of the US flag as a means of protest. Justice William Brennan, writing for the majority, stated that "[t]he way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they are wrong." The Court voiced to the world that disagreeable and offensive speech must be tolerated as freedom of expression and the protection of individual liberties are at the core of a free society.</p>

<p>The vital discussion of societal values was at the forefront of the <em>Johnson</em> decision, and it is this exact discussion that is absent from the current Court's decisions. For example, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-allows-military-funeral-protests.php">Snyder v. Phelps</a>, a case decided this year, presented a perfect opportunity to engage in public diplomacy with regard to free speech. In this case, tort damages were sought against the Westboro Baptist Church for protesting at a soldier's funeral, spouting hate speech at the burial itself and on the Internet. While this case was viewed as controversial by the media and the general public, it garnered strong consensus on the Court. In an 8-1 decision, the majority held that the First Amendment protects those who stage peaceful protests near the funeral of a military service member from tort liability. </p>

<p>The majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts is certainly on firm ground legally speaking. However, he and the other justices that joined his opinion missed an excellent opportunity to engage in public diplomacy. At a time where many post-conflict, developing and emerging societies are grappling with the concept and consequences of free speech, the Court would do well to offer non-doctrinal reasons for ideologically illustrative decisions. Understandably, the idea of allowing the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church to go unpunished in a society that values respect and order over individual liberties seems offensive and repugnant. However, rather than engaging in constructive dialogue or explaining why the US values free speech, the Court does little more than state that speech is powerful and that in spite of the pain it can cause, this nation has chosen a path that protects it. The Court insufficiently explains the value of free speech. While previous decisions of the Court have noted how important free speech is for the development and maintenance of a healthy society, political vibrancy and open and honest debate, the Court's current decisions avoid such commentary. </p>

<p>The Court is certainly the best institution to explain to scholars, governments, lawyers and lay people alike the enduring legal values of the US, why they have been chosen and how they contribute to the development of a stable and democratic society. A return to the mentality that one of America's most important exports is its legal traditions would certainly benefit the US and stands to benefit nations building and developing their own legal traditions, and our relations with them. Furthermore, it stands to increase the influence and higher the profile of the bench. The Court already engages in the exercise of dispensing justice and interpreting the Constitution, and to deliver its opinions with an eye toward their diplomatic value would take only minimal effort and has the potential for high returns. While the Court is indeed the best body to conduct legal diplomacy, it has been falling short in doing so in recent sessions. </p>

<p>We are at a critical moment in world history. People in the Middle East and North Africa are asserting discontent with their governments. Many nations in Africa, Asia, and Eurasia are grappling with new technologies, repressive regimes and economic despair. With the development of new countries, such as <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">South Sudan</a>, the formation of new governments, as is occurring in Egypt, and the development of new constitutions, as is occurring in Nepal, it is important that the US welcome and engage in legal diplomacy and informative two-way dialogue. As a nation with lasting and sustainable legal values and traditions, the Supreme Court should be at the forefront of public legal diplomacy. With each decision, the Supreme Court has the opportunity to better define, explain and defend key legal concepts. This is an opportunity that should not be wasted. </p>

                <p>The Istanbul talks are a chance to end the nearly five-month-long conflict in Libya. However, to achieve this much-needed peace, governments involved in peace-brokering should bear in mind that the prosecution of people who are wanted for grave crimes should not be bargained away. Indeed, any political solution that avoids meaningful justice will undercut prospects for a long-lasting peace. </p>

                <p>On June 27, the International Criminal Court (ICC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> for Gaddafi, his son Seif al-Islam, and Libya's intelligence chief, Abdullah Sanussi. They are wanted on charges of crimes against humanity for their roles in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-claims-libya-government-attacks-on-civilians-violate-international-law.php">attacks on civilians</a>, including peaceful demonstrators, in Tripoli, Benghazi, Misrata, and other Libyan cities and towns. Human Rights Watch documented the arbitrary arrests and disappearances of scores of people, as well as instances in which government forces opened fire on peaceful demonstrators after the start of anti-government <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">protests in eastern Libya</a> on February 15.</p>

                <p>By issuing arrest warrants, the ICC has taken an important step toward providing the victims of serious crimes in Libya the chance for redress. The ICC's action sends a strong message that the law can reach even those long thought to be immune to accountability. Justice should not be abandoned as efforts to end the devastating conflict are pursued. Human Rights Watch research in countries such as Sierra Leone and Angola shows that the failure to hold perpetrators of the most serious international crimes to account can contribute to future abuses.</p>

                <p>The record from other conflicts also shows that arrest warrants for senior leaders can actually strengthen peace efforts by stigmatizing those who stand in the way of conflict resolution. For example, the indictments of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">Radovan Karadzic</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia are credited with keeping them sidelined during the Dayton peace talks, which led to the end of the Bosnian war. In this way, accountability for the most serious international crimes can serve not only the interests of victims who want to see justice for their suffering, but also the longer-term interests of peace and stability.</p>

                <p>Libya came before the ICC in February as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">unanimous referral</a> by the Security Council under Resolution 1970.  The states on the council showed support for accountability by voting for the ICC referral. After setting the wheels of justice in motion, council members&#8212;among them France, the UK, and US&#8212;should stand by the strong action they took in February and reaffirm the message that impunity is no longer an option.</p>

                <p>Handing Gaddafi a "get out of jail free card" would not only be inconsistent with the international community's expressed commitment to justice for crimes in Libya, but would also have serious consequences for a durable peace. Sidestepping accountability in Libya would send a message to abusive leaders around the world that if they hang on long enough, all will be forgiven. </p>

                <p><em>Richard Dicker has been the Director of International Justice at Human Rights Watch since its founding in 2001. He has previously been involved in the attempt by Human Rights Watch to charge the Iraqi government with genocide against the Kurds before the International Court of Justice. Dicker also led the Human Rights Watch campaign to establish the ICC.</em></p>

While the details are fluid, the essence of his proposal appears to be:</p>

<p>1) Congress would authorize the president to raise the debt limit by as much as $2.5 trillion in three installments. The first, an increase of $700 billion, would come immediately. The next two, worth $900 billion each, would come this fall and some time next summer.</p>

<p>2) On each occasion, the president would be required to submit to Congress an explicit request for an increase, along with a menu of proposed spending cuts equal to the requested increase. The submission of the president's first request would automatically raise the debt limit by $100 billion to give the Treasury Department breathing room while Congress considers the request.</p>

<p>3) Lawmakers would then have 15 days to pass a resolution of disapproval, giving them an opportunity to go on record against raising the debt ceiling. The president could veto the resolution, and the debt limit would then rise, provided the veto could not be overridden.</p>

<p>McConnell's strategy makes no provision for the required spending cut proposal to be enacted. Aides said lawmakers could pick and choose from the president's list when they put together appropriations bills in a separate process. While McConnell's tactical inventiveness is clever, it is an open question as to whether it is in line with the separation of powers.</p>

<p>The first step, authorizing the president to raise the debt limit, appears to be a departure from the past in which Congress itself raised the debt limit. The second step has the debt limit automatically rise by $100 billion by the submission of a requested increase, again without congressional action. The third step foresees a vote within 15 days of disapproval. In the absence of such a vote of disapproval within the 15 days, it is unclear whether the debt ceiling is raised or not or by what amount. If there is such a vote of disapproval, the president can veto it. If two-thirds of both houses of Congress fail to vote to override the veto, the debt limit rises by $900 billion without congressional action to alter the legislation setting the debt ceiling.</p>

<p>What is clear under all three steps is that Congress itself is not raising the debt ceiling limit as it has traditionally done, but instead the president becomes the fulcrum for the debt ceiling increases. Coupled with these increases will be a growing uncertainty as to whether the debt ceiling has in fact been properly increased.</p>

<p><a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section1">Article I, Section 1</a> of the Constitution places the legislative power with Congress. <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Article I, Section 8</a> gives Congress the power to tax and spend and to borrow money on the credit of the United States. At the heart of this legislative power is the power to budget and authorize debt. While attacks on legislation based on the non-delegation doctrine do not generally succeed, one does wonder whether the compromise amounts to a congressional abdication to the president or a failure to give legislative definition of the scope of the president's power. While this point would not be dispositive, is there really an "intelligible principle" guiding the shift of authority to the president for raising the debt limit in this convoluted manner? The evidence so far makes it clear that this approach is being considered solely based on political calculations.</p>

<p>Moreover, comparing this proposed structure to a simple congressional vote, one sees a shift of power to the president that may harken a further imbalance in the separation of powers. The first three steps call for the president to propose various spending decreases to Congress at the same time that the president seeks the debt ceiling increases. The spending cut proposals are without any particular effect as the subsequent mandated congressional action is with regard to the debt ceiling and not the spending cuts. Would these proposed spending cuts amount to a backdoor kind of line item veto? On the one hand, the budgeting power remains with Congress, on the other, the presidential initiative creates an <em>ad hoc</em> budgeting and authorization process outside of standard budgetary procedures. What of spending authorized by Congress but targeted on the list of spending cuts submitted by the president? One concern is whether these listed cuts have the effect of suspending or calling the appropriations into question, another shift of power to the president over appropriations that should have the effect of law.</p>

<p>In the president's exercise of discretion in this arena, is there any meaningful guidance provided under this plan by Congress? It is unclear what principles will guide the president at each step in the process and whether Congress will channel presidential authority in a meaningful way. If the president is being given guidance, what happens if a president wishes to seek a debt ceiling increase without making a proposal of cuts? Does the McConnell proposal&#8212;cutting the other way&#8212;impinge on the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section3">Article II, Section 3</a> power to recommend such measures as the president shall judge necessary and expedient?</p>

<p>While some may view this as a more palatable solution than the Fourteenth Amendment approach, proponents of which argue that debt ceiling legislation in itself is unconstitutional, those watching this process will no doubt compare it with past debt ceiling debates. Even the resolution of the 1995-1996 budget crisis was more elegant, with a series of congressional authorizations of particular types of debt and ultimately a debt limit increase.</p>

<p>The uncertainties in the manner in which the McConnell process works, and the question of whether it shifts too much power between the president and Congress, will cause greater uncertainty over the next 18 months. This uncertainty will continue to impact investment decisions and the pace of the recovery. It is apparent that some politicians may feel they have backed themselves into a corner and are looking for an exit. However, these political calculations, by persons who purport to venerate the Constitution, require more than this convoluted, questionable approach.</p>

<p>This is not about the members of Congress, it is about the country. It is about making sure that on August 3 social security checks go out to those who have paid into the system, and that the US, with its special role in the world, is seen to conduct itself in an orderly manner. All parties involved in this debate should think carefully about whether this process, if enacted, would withstand a court challenge. All involved must keep it simple, rather than creating a new monster with unintended consequences which we may all come to regret the next time this issue comes to the fore.</p>

		<title>Media Ownership in the Third Circuit: A Sweeping Public Interest Victory</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://pages.citebite.com/v8v8s1m5fapa">Corie Wright</a>, Policy Counsel for <a href="http://www.freepress.net/">Free Press</a>, argues that the Third Circuit's ruling restoring the cross-ownership ban on media was a sweeping victory for the public interest and that the FCC must work to maintain diversity in media ownership to ensure competition and the quality of news...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/coriewright.JPG" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t is <em>d&#233;j&#224; vu</em> all over again for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-restores-cross-ownership-ban-on-media.php">struck down</a>&#8212;for a second time&#8212;an attempt by the FCC to relax portions of its longstanding media ownership rules. The case, <em>Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC (Prometheus II)</em>, is the latest iteration of litigation that is notable both for its messy and contentious procedural history, as well as its "underdog" appeal. It pitted a handful of public interest groups against both the FCC and the nation's most powerful and wealthiest media companies. It was a sweeping victory for the public interest.<br />
                <br />
                The FCC's media ownership limits are designed to promote competition and diversity by protecting local markets from being controlled by a small handful of media companies. The FCC maintains limits on the number of television and radio stations that one company can own in a single media market. Since 1975, the FCC has banned common ownership of a local daily newspaper and television station in the same market, commonly referred to as the "cross ownership rule." The media industry has made repeated attempts to eliminate the rules, while public interest and consumer groups have pushed for at the very least maintaining protections, but also tightening the limits further.<br />
                <br />
                In 2004, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/fcc-wont-appeal-third-circuit-ruling.php">threw out</a> a previous FCC effort to relax all of its media limits in <em>Prometheus Radio Project v. FCC (Prometheus I)</em>. Those rules were remanded to the agency for further review. This month, the same Third Circuit panel rejected the FCC's decision on remand to relax its cross-ownership ban. It also faulted the FCC for failing to take logical steps to promote diversity in media ownership, which the court had instructed the agency to do when it remanded the rules in <em>Prometheus I</em>.<br />
                <br />
                In <em>Prometheus II</em>, the newspaper and broadcast lobby, including media giants Tribune, News Corp. and Clear Channel, tried to have the ownership limits thrown out on constitutional grounds. Public interest groups defended the constitutionality of the rules, as well as the need for such rules to promote local media competition. The court rejected the corporations' constitutional arguments, citing longstanding Supreme Court rulings upholding the merits of media ownership limits generally. In rejecting the industry arguments and exposing the FCC's failures, the court wisely concluded that competition in the media&#8212;not more concentration&#8212;will provide Americans with the local news and information they need and want.<br />
                <br />
                While the court upheld the constitutionality of the rules broadly and affirmed maintaining existing limits on broadcast television and radio ownership, the FCC's decision to relax the cross ownership rule did not fare so well. Without even reaching the merits, the majority of the three-judge panel determined that by allotting only two vague sentences to the discussion of a new cross ownership rule in its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC failed to provide sufficient notice of the rule change as required by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedures Act</a>. Additionally, the majority cited evidence of highly irregular agency procedures, indicating that the outcome of the proceeding had been predetermined by then-FCC Chairman Kevin Martin. These included allegations that FCC officials suppressed internal research that supported the public interest groups' position, and had circulated an order containing the revised cross-ownership rule even before the public comment process had concluded. The court vacated the rule altogether, reinstating the original ban on cross-ownership.<br />
                <br />
                The court reserved particularly harsh words for the FCC's failure to adequately consider measures to improve media ownership opportunities for women and people of color. Despite directing the FCC consider the problem in the <em>Prometheus I</em> decision, the court found that the agency had "punted yet again on this important issue." A unanimous panel determined that the FCC failed to consider the effects of its rules on minority and female ownership, despite a congressional mandate to encourage ownership among underrepresented groups. It also suggested that the commission ignored evidence in the record that media concentration makes it harder for women and people of color to break into the industry and become broadcast station owners. </p>

                <p>Even though the court upheld the need for media ownership limits, industry groups are still pushing the FCC to eliminate them. It is not the commission's job to protect industry profit margins. The FCC cannot ignore the overwhelming evidence that existing media consolidation levels adversely impact the amount and quality of news from diverse sources. Instead it should use its upcoming ownership review to tighten current ownership limits and promote media diversity, localism and competition.<br />
                    <br />
                    With the court's recent decision, the FCC will now embark on yet another review of media ownership limits. Any action the agency takes will surely be subject to continued court battles as industry and public interest groups vie over the ultimate outcome. What is more, the Third Circuit has once again asserted jurisdiction over the remanded issues. The FCC has already struck out twice before that court. Maybe the third time will be the charm.<br />

		<title>Chinese Human Rights Plan Must Address Past Failings to Succeed</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Phelim Kine, Senior Researcher in the Asia Division of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, argues that in order for the Chinese government to legitimately address human rights concerns, it must acknowledge the shortcomings of previous efforts and ensure that government officials and security forces follow and enforce human rights protections...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/hrw.png" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n July 12, 2011, Wang Chen, the head of China's State Council Information Office, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/china-drafts-new-human-rights-plan.php">announced</a> that "the cause of human rights in China has entered a new stage." This was not an exaggeration. Since mid-February 2011, the Chinese government, spooked by the pro-democracy movements in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">North Africa and the Middle East</a>, has detained, arrested, and forcibly disappeared dozens of Chinese lawyers, civil society activists, artists and bloggers. This "new stage" is the worst repression in China in more than a decade.</p>

                <p>Those targeted have included the activist-artist Ai Weiwei, who was forcibly disappeared and remained in police custody under "residential surveillance" for 80 days until his release on June 22 after allegedly confessing to tax fraud.  The whereabouts of others, such as the Guangzhou-based human rights lawyer Liu Shihui, who disappeared after being brutally beaten by a group of unidentified individuals on February 20, remain a mystery to all but their security agent abductors.</p>

                <p>Wang was not referring to the victims of the Chinese government's increasingly lower tolerance for dissent, however.  His remarks were instead part of the long-awaited official assessment of the Chinese government's first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/china-issues-first-human-rights.php">National Human Rights Action Plan</a>. The plan, unveiled in April 2009, marked the government's first explicit attempt to identify and address human rights abuses within a specific time frame on issues ranging from torture in custody and illegal detention to the "overall promotion of digitalized movie, radio and TV service."</p>

                <p>Wang, who does double-duty as the director of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's External Propaganda Department, was sanguine about the plan's success. According to him, "by the end of 2010, all measures stipulated in the Action Plan had been put into practice with all goals achieved and tasks fulfilled." He added that the government planned to replicate that "success" in a new, four-year National Human Rights Action Plan from 2012-2015.</p>

                <p>In theory, a national human rights action plan&#8212;a recommendation for all states stemming from the 1993 UN World Conference on Human Rights&#8212;can provide an opportunity for a government to honestly identify and seek resolution of urgent human rights problems. The Chinese government deserves some credit for making an attempt at such a plan. Its first plan was notable for the government's explicit rhetorical shift from a traditional prioritization of "rights of subsistence and development" over civil and political rights by specifically acknowledging that "all kinds of human rights are interdependent and inseparable."</p>

                <p>In its details, the plan was less impressive. Rather than outlining innovative approaches to tackle well-documented human rights problems, it did little more than reiterate existing commitments under international and domestic law as well as the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Rather than reflecting broad government support, the plan lacked the input and participation of the security agencies&#8212;which are responsible for the overwhelming majority of China's human rights abuses. In addition, the Plan also lacked any substantive benchmarks or the kind of detail that would allow for meaningful assessment of progress.</p>

                <p>The Chinese government's demonstrable disdain for human rights over the plan's two year duration speaks volumes about its intentions. In 2009-1010, the government systematically continued to violate many of the most basic rights the plan addressed. It took unambiguous steps to restrict rights to expression, association and assembly. It sentenced high-profile dissidents to lengthy prison terms on spurious state secrets or "subversion" charges, expanded restrictions on media and internet freedom as well as tightened controls on lawyers, human rights defenders, and nongovernmental organizations. It broadened controls on Uighurs and Tibetans, and engaged in increasing numbers of enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions, including in secret, unlawful detention facilities known as "black jails."</p>

                <p>Wang Chen's assessment of the plan makes no mention of such abuses. Instead, his assessment is larded with irrelevant statistics ("By the end of 2010, China had formulated 236 laws ... 690 administrative regulations and more than 8,600 local rules and regulations"), meaningless ambiguities ("Over the past two years, China has perfected laws and regulations to protect the rights and interests of ethnic minorities"), and bald-faced lies ("extorting confession by torture and illegal detention by law enforcement personnel has been strictly forbidden"). This does not bode well for the next plan, slated to run from 2012-2015.</p>

                <p>If the Chinese government is serious about formulating an effective plan for 2012-2015, it must acknowledge and learn from the shortcomings of the 2009-2010 plan. That will require an independent review commission to evaluate the success of the original plan to identify the gaps between the plan's rhetoric and their implementation. Any plan with a hope of success will require the participation and cooperation of the Public Security Bureau. Rather than the hortatory, opaque and ambiguous slate of objectives which hobbled the original plan, a new 2012-2015 document must incorporate transparent benchmarks to measure progress in areas including enforcement of prohibitions on torture and illegal detention and enforcing rights including freedom of expression, assembly and association.</p>

                <p>The success of any human rights action plan will ultimately hinge on ensuring government officials and security forces choose to obey and uphold the law rather than reflexively ignore, subvert and abuse it. At a time of rising popular unrest related to China's yawning rural-urban wealth gap, growing labor unrest, tension in its ethnic minority regions, and simmering public resentment over rampant corruption and illegal land evictions, the Chinese government's disregard for rule of law is an increasingly dangerous formula for instability.</p>

                <p>Without true rule of law, any official action plan to protect the rights of Chinese citizens such as Ai Weiwei and Li Shihui will remain empty promises on paper.</p>

		<title>Recent Scandal One in a Series of Legal Issues for News Corp</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.freepress.net/node/86055">Dave Saldana</a>, Communications Director for <a href="http://www.freepress.net/">Free Press</a>, argues that the recent News Corp. scandal will likely follow along the line of the company's previous US legal troubles, in which it was able to avoid penalties through campaign donations and deft lobbying...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/davesaldana.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>or some ideological opponents watching the ever-unfolding scandal involving News Corp's now-defunct <em>News of the World</em>, the word <em>schadenfreude</em> does not quite do the story justice, with every new revelation an embarrassment for Rupert Murdoch and his empire.</p>

                <p>Many have hypothesized about whether the phone-hacking scandal could signal the end of News Corp., or at least the end of Murdoch's tenure as its unquestioned leader. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/fbi-to-probe-news-corp-in-911-phone-hacking-scandal.php">investigations</a> are not over, so anything is still possible, but I doubt that we will see News Corp. damaged in any serious, long-term way, or that Murdoch will step down. The reason for this is simple: too much time, effort and money has been spent creating bulwarks against either scenario occurring. If there is one thing Murdoch understands, perhaps better than any single person in any industry, it is that the best way to retain power is to accumulate more.</p>

                <p>Particularly in the US, Murdoch has gotten his way with regulators and policymakers simply by wielding his most powerful weapons&#8212;his media holdings and his checkbook. Some of the special exceptions and advantages News Corp. has secured for itself in the US include waivers of federal newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rules, increased limits on its national television holdings, and exceptions to foreign ownership laws.</p>

                <p>The cross-ownership rules were put in place to prevent one company from dominating the public debate in a community by controlling two of the most important media venues&#8212;the local television station and the local daily newspaper. News Corp. has fought for years to eradicate those rules, even as it has benefited from waivers that allow it to own New York City's Fox station, WNYW, as well as the <em>New York Post</em>, and WWOR-TV, just across the Hudson River in Secaucus, New Jersey. Oddly enough, the waiver that allows News Corp. to run WWOR expired in 2008. Despite public complaints that WWOR fails to serve the northern New Jersey community where it is based, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not acted on renewing or denying the waiver.</p>

                <p>News Corp. and the Fox network are able to reach so many Americans because of either an amazing coincidence or very deft lobbying. Prior to the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/telecom.html">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a>, no network was allowed to own stations that covered more than 25 percent of the US population. The act upped that number to 35 percent. When in 2003 Fox's holdings broke through that barrier, the FCC did not step up to force Fox to divest itself of the offending holdings. Instead, it raised the cap to 45 percent. Congress, to its credit, recognized that 45 percent was simply too high a limit and overrode the FCC, setting a new cap. In response to an onslaught of News Corp. lobbyists, the limit was set at 39 percent&#8212;the exact amount Fox needed to avoid divestiture.</p>

                <p>None of this would be possible if foreign ownership rules remained in play, preventing foreign companies from owning more than 25 percent of any American television or radio station. Australian-born Murdoch is now a naturalized US citizen, but that did not change the fact that News Corp. is an Australia-based company, and its 99 percent ownership of Fox broke the law.</p>

                <p>That should have been the end of it, but Murdoch is not one to back down. He turned loose legions of lobbyists, including one who reportedly threatened then-FCC chair Reed Hundt that he would not be able to "get a job as a dog catcher" if he crossed Murdoch. The result was that the FCC concluded that the law was broken, but rather than enforce it, the FCC granted News Corp. a waiver. That is an impressive amount of power for any one company, and more importantly for Murdoch himself, to wield. For those who fear that corporations have more power than everyday citizens, they could ask for no more obvious an example.</p>

                <p>However, it is important to realize that News Corp. is merely a symptom of a larger problem. The disease is the consolidation of media, where a handful of companies wield overwhelming power and are able to influence public issues and steer the debate to suit their ends&#8212;usually with impunity. News Corp. is an obvious example, but there are many others, ATamp;&T and Comcast among them.</p>

                <p>The pathogen for this disease is money. Where they cannot influence policy through manipulation of the discussion of important public affairs, they can simply buy influence with policymakers outright. The perfect examples of this are News Corp's million-dollar donations to Republican gubernatorial campaigns in 2010 or Comcast's hundreds of millions in lobbying and campaign donations in support of its merger with NBC-Universal.</p>

                <p>Or look at AT&amp;T's conduct in the proposed merger with wireless competitor T-Mobile, as it unleashes a torrential downpour of lobbying money and campaign donations. AT&amp;T is so sure that it will prevail that it can dismiss out of hand Senator Herb Kohl, chair of the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, who wrote to the FCC and Department of Justice to say that "the acquisition, if permitted to proceed, would likely cause substantial harm to competition and consumers, would be contrary to antitrust law and not in the public interest, and therefore should be blocked by your agencies." In the face of this, AT&amp;T's confidence is unflagging, because it knows it has several hundred million reasons to push for the merger, and millions of means to get it. If Rupert Murdoch's experience is any indicator, that confidence has a strong foundation.</p>

		<title>&#039;Anti-Prostitution Pledge&#039; Ruling Corrects Misguided, Harmful Policy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristy Kade, Associate Director of Advocacy and Public Policy for <a href="http://www.pathfind.org/site/PageServer">Pathfinder International</a>, argues that the recent Second Circuit ruling that the US cannot withhold HIV/AIDS funding to organizations based on their stance on prostitution corrects a policy that tied the hands of organizations working to stop the spread of HIV...<br><hr height="1"><br><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> expect few Americans took notice when the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-us-cannot-make-aids-funding-conditional-on-anti-prostitution-laws.php">ruled</a> in a case brought by Pathfinder International and Alliance for Open Society International, finding that a federal statute requiring public health groups to oppose prostitution in order to receive funding for their HIV and AIDS work overseas was unconstitutional.</p>

                <p>This oversight is not surprising. Little attention was paid when the restriction was first applied to US-based groups in 2005, despite objections from NGOs that such a policy would severely undermine their free speech, as well as efforts to prevent the spread of HIV worldwide&#8212;the stated goal of the US Global AIDS program. Again, little outrage was shown in 2010 when, following a temporary suspension of the US appeal, the Obama administration decided to continue to defend the policy in court. While fundamentally about sex, the issue is hardly sexy, and primarily impacts those individuals few rise to defend&#8212;the poorest of the poor, mostly women, often young, and on the absolute margins of society&#8212;sex workers.</p>

                <p>The policy, commonly known as the "anti-prostitution pledge," requires any organization&#8212;American or foreign&#8212;that receives federal funding to fight HIV and AIDS abroad to adopt a formal position condemning prostitution and trafficking. I know of no one in the NGO community who does not abhor and oppose trafficking; it is among the most severe of all human rights abuses. The pledge's conflation of sex work and trafficking, however, ignores the realities that in many developing countries. Individuals sell sex for their livelihood&#8212;food, shelter, childcare&#8212;and these individuals require and deserve access to health and social services, including HIV prevention and care. <br />
                    <br />
                    Pathfinder has worked on the front lines of this epidemic for more than 25 years. From this experience, we know that organizing and empowering sex workers to advocate for their rights can be an effective HIV prevention strategy, and can reduce other harms associated with sex work, including violence and exploitation. We believe we have a moral obligation to provide evidence-based, lifesaving services. We have no desire to judge, condemn or further stigmatize the very individuals we are trying to help, driving them further underground, limiting their ability to access healthcare, provide for their families or eventually leave the industry. Does this mean Pathfinder supports or promotes prostitution? Of course not. Does the US government think so? That is another matter entirely.<br />
                    <br />
                    As a result of this misguided policy, there has been a tremendous loss of respect overseas for American foreign policy objectives purporting to promote democracy. On the one hand, the US government asserts free speech as essential for democracy and, on the other, restricts speech, in this case, presumably because the subject of sex is involved. Most troubling, the pledge restricts what organizations can do and say with not only federal funds, but with their own private funds as well.<br />
                    <br />
                    Trust that it was not an easy decision for Pathfinder to take its largest funder, the US government, to court. However, we strongly believe vital principles were, and continue to be, at stake. Private organizations cannot be told what to think or believe; they cannot be compelled to espouse a government mandated position. They must be free to challenge the status quo, to speak out on the behalf of the vulnerable and disenfranchised. Otherwise the value of civil society within a democracy is completely undermined. If the anti-prostitution pledge were allowed to stand, it opens a dangerous door to further ideological restrictions, subjecting private organizations to the whims of politicians even when public funds are not at issue.<br />
                    <br />
                    Unfortunately, the right of US organizations to operate without undue government interference is not the only issue at hand. Our partner organizations in developing countries, who are the main implementers of HIV and AIDS-related services, are not protected by the ruling. They will still be made subject to the pledge. In fact, the US has a long history of exporting unconstitutional policies abroad&#8212;often policies that Americans are not even aware of&#8212;as a means of appeasing a few, loud ideologues, whose voices tend to drown out pragmatic and scientific best practices. These acts of political expediency come at the expense of people's lives.<br />
                    <br />
                    Americans need to start paying attention. Casualties of our culture wars are piling up in countries across the globe. The scope of the epidemic remains immense; more than 33 million people are living with HIV worldwide. Even as the US admirably works to provide medicine and treatment, we completely undermine our efforts by tying the hands of health workers and refusing to prioritize evidence-based prevention efforts. In fact, for every two people we provide with lifesaving anti-retroviral treatment, five more become newly infected with HIV.<br />
                    <br />
                    Any organization that works to address the tragedy of HIV and AIDS in less developed countries must confront head on the need to serve sex workers. They are among the most at-risk for contracting and spreading the disease. The reality of the HIV epidemic demands we do all that we can to help all individuals effectively protect themselves from infection, regardless of their race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or occupation. This is not a matter of being pro- or anti-prostitution; it is a matter of being opposed to the spread of HIV.</p>

		<title>The Lisbon Treaty and the New Framework for EU Foreign Affairs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Konstantinos Margaritis is a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://www.law.uoa.gr/">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Faculty of Law</a>. For his doctoral research, he is examining the protection of fundamental rights under the Lisbon Treaty. He writes on the changes in the field of external affairs under the Lisbon Treaty and the impact they will have on the EU as an international actor...<br /><hr height='1'><br /><strong>T</strong>he <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm">Lisbon Treaty</a>, earlier known as the Reform Treaty, was designed to reorganize and restructure the constitutional framework of the EU by amending the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML">Treaty on European Union</a> (TEU) and the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:en:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU) [PDF]. The aim, as stated in the preamble, is "to complete the process started by the Treaty of Amsterdam and by the Treaty of Nice with a view to enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and to improving the coherence of its action." While the full effect of the Lisbon Treaty is not yet completely understood, looking at the institutional changes that impact the field of external affairs allows for a heightened understanding of the EU as an international actor.</p>

<p>In terms of legal framework, between 1993 and 2009, the EU consisted of three pillars. This system consisted of the European Community, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Justice and Home Affairs, which respectively dealt with matters of economics, foreign policy and criminal justice. However, when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the EU consolidated the three-pillar system and adopted one legal personality.  </p>

<p>To replace the foreign policy pillar, Title V of the TEU was introduced with the Lisbon Treaty. The general provisions of the text set forth the basic objectives of the Union, in terms of creating a framework for more coordinated external action. These provisions heavily emphasized unifying concepts, such as the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, respect of human rights and dignity in the wider world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in response to the absence of a coordinated foreign policy, the Lisbon Treaty expanded the role of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in an effort to coordinate foreign policy. The holder of this position is responsible for organizing EU policy in matters of external action, and speaking for the EU on matters of common foreign and security policy. Furthermore, the High Representative chairs the Council of EU Foreign Ministers and sits in the European Commission. In short, the High Representative serves as a foreign minister for the entire EU, allowing for the more cohesive development and expression of the Union's common foreign and security policy. While the High Representative represents the Union in the international arena, it is always in close cooperation with member states' diplomatic missions. Furthermore, the centrality of unity in the development and expression of foreign policy is reflected in the fact that the High Representative is responsible for trying to resolve diplomatic problems among the Union's member states.</p>

<p>Also contributing to increased coordination is the fact that as an international actor with a legal personality, the EU may conclude international agreements with other countries or international organizations. By crystallizing this, the Lisbon Treaty simplified the conditions under which and the process through which the Union concludes agreements. As article 216 of the TFEU mentions, the Union may also conclude international agreements in case of necessity in order to achieve one of its objectives. According to article 218 of the TFEU, the council keeps the initiative, and recommendations need to be submitted by the commission and the High Representative if the agreement is related to common foreign and security policy. The role of the European Parliament has increased. When the council adopts a decision concluding an agreement under paragraph six, it needs the parliament's consent in some cases, and the parliament's opinion in all the other cases where the agreement is related to common foreign and security policy. </p>

<p>The Lisbon Treaty also provides for increased coordination in terms of the protection of its citizens' personal data. Before the treaty went into force, the TEU did not provide any legal basis for data protection. However, the Lisbon Treaty not only recognized a subjective right to the protection of personal data, Article 39 of the TEU now establishes that specific rules will be laid down by the council on the protection of personal data processed by member states in the area of common foreign and security policy.</p>

<p>In the field of common commercial policy, the power of the European Parliament has also increased under the Lisbon Treaty, as the new article 207 of the TFEU enhances the role of parliament concerning decisions taken in the executive. The Union also enjoys exclusive competence in this area, giving it the sole power to determine the course of the Union's trade with developing countries, which includes areas such as tariffs, trade subsidies, import quotas and voluntary export restraints.</p>

<p>The objectives in the development cooperation area have been modified. The main objective now is to fight poverty. Article 208 of the TFEU highlights the primacy of that goal in stating that the "Union development co-operation policy shall have as its primary objective the reduction, and in the long term, the eradication of poverty." The Union has the power to conclude international agreements for the purpose of development. Furthermore, it has the power to take measures with regard to financial assistance when needed.</p>

<p>Another example of the increased coordination and consolidation of power fostered by the Lisbon Treaty is article 214 of the TFEU, which deals with humanitarian aid. The amendments contain provisions for ad hoc assistance, relief and protection, for people in developing countries that are victims of natural or manmade disasters. In the area of humanitarian aid, the Union is again endowed with the power to conclude international agreements with respect to the principles of international law and human rights.</p>

<p>As explained in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/multimedia/publications/publications/annual-reports/2010_en.htm">Annual Report 2010 on the European Community's Development and External Assistance Policies and their Implementation in 2009</a>, the EU was the largest provider of development aid. In fact, the EU was responsible for more than half of global official development assistance, which is calculated at &euro;48.2 billion. Furthermore, the EU has developed policies for financial assistance throughout the world. Under the program named V-FLEX, during 2009 and 2010 some &euro;215 million were committed to assist 11 African and two Caribbean countries in combating economic crisis and shortfalls in their national budgets. </p>

<p>The EU's dedication to the protection of human rights is demonstrated from an institutional perspective by its prospective accession to the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR). The ECHR sets minimum standards and seeks to provide a European framework for the protection of human rights. Furthermore, widely accepted human rights form the basis for mandatory rules that parties have no freedom to derogate from. Accordingly, all EU legal acts have to be adopted in accordance with the level of protection guaranteed by the ECHR. As such, the EU submits its legal acts to be examined by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=echr">European Court of Human Rights</a>, a supra-national court specialized in human rights protections. </p>

<p>Another novelty of the Lisbon Treaty concerns the provisions on common security and defense policy. As in other areas of external action, the purpose of the Lisbon Treaty amendments in the area of defense is to harmonize the policy of the member states in terms of security and defense and to promote cooperation. For example, Article 42 of the TEU refers to the situations in which the EU may use military force on missions outside the Union. Those situations "shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military advice and assistant tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including post-conflict stabilization." Apart from a clearer codification of when the use of military force is appropriate, the Lisbon Treaty provided for the concept of enhanced cooperation in the area of defense policy. This allows for a minimum of nine EU member states to establish advanced cooperation in an area within the EU's competence without requiring the involvement of other member states. Lisbon also provides the framework for the development of a permanent structured cooperation in defense, which would allow member states with higher-level militaries to form a permanent defense structure under EU structures.  </p>

<p>Although serious steps have been taken towards a common Union defense policy, the EU's ability to function independently of member states under the Lisbon Treaty is still limited. Every decision in the area of common defense policy has to be taken by the European Council acting unanimously, and every member state must adopt those decisions in accordance with their own constitutional requirements. Furthermore, each member state's decisions regarding defense policy must be respected. This requires high levels of political will, as achieving complete consensus in an issue as divisive as defense policy is not easily accomplished. A perfect example of this is the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a>. The lack of consensus has inevitably led to the lack of a common defense policy. On the basis of their different interests, the EU's major military powers have adopted completely different measures for dealing with the promotion of peace and stability in Libya. France and the UK have approved a strategic plan that includes military intervention, while Germany has abstained from any kind of military operation and in turn has favored greater political pressure.</p>

<p>The changes underlined above seem to develop a new EU strategy for the international arena. Under the new institutional framework, the Union is able to act with heightened autonomy and, as such, it demonstrates a united and more highly integrated policy in its external affairs. New unifying concepts are also focused on to achieve strategic coordination in terms of development, the promotion of the rule of law and human rights, and the battle against poverty. Furthermore, these uniting policies aid in the creation of a more positive profile of the Union in the world and in accomplishing alliances with developing countries. As the solidarity clause dictates "the Union and its member states shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity." Going forward, the course of the Union will be determined by the political will of its member states, their decisions in how to deal with the challenges of the twenty-first century and their approaches to the new framework established by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

The law was proposed by Yisrael Beiteinu, a nationalist party that is part of the governing coalition, and was endorsed by Netanyahu. The Knesset voted 47-38 to enact the law, a vote taken after intense, acrimonious debate.</p>

<p>What made the enactment of the law so controversial was its punishment of free speech. Specifically, the law calls for civil and administrative penalties against anyone in Israel's jurisdiction who boycotts or "calls for boycotts" of Israel, or "one of its institutions," or "an area under its control."</p>

<p>It is this last clause that is at the heart of the Israeli political dispute which produced the law. The areas referred to are Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Significant numbers of Israelis who oppose settlement of the West Bank, or oppose some of the settlements on the West Bank, have boycotted products produced by such settlements. Israeli performing artists have refused to perform in the auditoriums of West Bank settlements.</p>

<p>Netanyahu justified his support of the law because, in his words, these boycotts "delegitimized Israel." In short it is Netanyahu's view that those who disagree with his government's West Bank policy cannot exercise their right of free speech to call for West Bank boycotts because such speech is a threat to Israel. It evidently did not occur to him that limitation upon freedom of speech might pose a greater threat of delegitimation of Israel's democracy.  </p>

<p>Everyone is for free speech except when they're not. When people are appalled or genuinely frightened by ideas, belief in free speech tends to disappear. So it is worth recalling some fundamental elements of free speech theory to clarify why this Israeli law is a terrible blunder, and to explain why Netanyahu has turned free speech theory on its head.</p>

<p>English philosopher John Stuart Mill, writing in the mid-nineteenth century, made some of the best known arguments for free speech. First, Mill argued in his essay <a href="http://www.constitution.org/jsm/liberty.htm">On Liberty</a>, that to justify prohibition of the dissemination of ideas, to censor thought and speech, one must logically assume that the censor is infallible. The censor must possess the truth with certainty, if truth rather than authority is to be our guide. Mill simply did not believe an infallible human being ever existed. </p>

<p>A second idea Mill put forth was that if people were not forced to refute others' opinions, their own opinions would become "husks" of their former selves. People would believe as they did for reasons they did not know. Interestingly, he gave Christianity in England as an example of a popular belief that people had lost the ability to justify or explain. Does a triangle contain angles totaling 180 degrees because your high school teacher said so, or can you explain why? These ideas, and others, led Mill to his famous argument for a "marketplace of ideas" as the best way to seek truth. If the result of the marketplace was not certain, it was more likely to be right than truth declared by censoring competing ideas.</p>

<p>In <em>Masses Publishing v. Patten</em>, Judge Learned Hand was faced with the question whether a leftist magazine's advocacy of draft resistance during World War I was lawful under the US Espionage Act. Hand concluded that such active dissent to the government's war policy was lawful, and he produced a remarkable paragraph explaining why:<blockquote>Detestation of existing policies is easily transformed into forcible resistance of the authority which puts them into 	execution ... Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of political agitation which in normal times is the safeguard of free government. The 	distinction is not a scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.</blockquote>Judge Hand was arguing in short that freedom of speech is a functional requirement of democratic government. Ten years later, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9558803063364299687">Whitney v. California</a>, Justice Louis Brandeis made an eloquent argument for free speech which went beyond Hand's functional argument. The question was whether California could criminalize socialist and communist revolutionary parties. Justice Brandeis provided another basic argument for freedom of speech: "[The Framers] believed that the final end of government was to make men free to develop their faculties." Justice Brandeis's assertion was that government is to provide the freedom necessary for persons to develop their abilities and to define for themselves who they are. Today, we would call this the development of personal autonomy and the self. There is no more concise definition of the purpose of the liberal state, and the freedom necessary to produce autonomous individuals is to be extended to all persons, including radical political dissidents.</p>

<p>Free speech theory suggests therefore that freedom of speech is necessary to understand what we think (Mill), necessary for democracy to function (Hand), and necessary to develop the human personality (Brandeis). There must be an extraordinary burden upon government before it can justifiably punish thought and speech. </p>

<p>Nearly 350 years ago, in 1670, the great (albeit heretical), Jewish philosopher Spinoza published the <a href="http://www.yesselman.com/ttpelws1.htm">Theological-Political Treatise</a>, a criticism of biblical literalism and the first justification of the liberal state. He necessarily published it anonymously, for even in his home of the Netherlands, the book was seen as viciously evil. Despite anonymous publication, Spinoza was later charged with advocacy of atheism, defense of science, skepticism and freedom of speech, not the first time such charges had been leveled against him.</p>

<p>The Netanyahu government obviously forgot to read Chapter 20 of the Treatise. It is entitled "It is shown that in a free commonwealth every man may think what he pleases, and say what he thinks."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist and former JURIST Executive Director Abigail Salisbury says that the Ethiopian government has used the War on Terror to maintain its power, labeling opposition groups, journalists and others as terrorists and detaining them under legislation that is purportedly aimed at furthering the War on Terror...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/abigailsalisbury.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t is not entirely out of the ordinary to hear of the arrest of political dissidents in Ethiopia, but a recent cluster of arrests has drawn attention from the international human rights community. Over the last few weeks, a group of at least nine journalists, Ethiopian National Democratic Party members and others, have been arrested and detained under Ethiopia's <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Anti-Terrorism Proclamation No. 652</a>. This added to some two dozen other individuals said to have been charged under the same law over the last couple of months. This 2009 law uses the buzzword "terrorism" to encourage the West to continue to see Ethiopia as a vital partner in the War on Terror, drawing attention away from the law's true purpose: suppressing any opposition to the regime of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Given the recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria">unrest</a> in several other African countries, the uptick in arrests under the law is worrying, and tends to validate earlier concerns over its potential for facilitating human rights violations.   </p>

<p>Disguising human rights violations and oppression with positive terminology is not new to Ethiopian legislators, who passed the <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/substantive-law-legislations/human-rights-and-governance/media-and-information/225-freedom-of-the-mass-media-and-access-to-information-proclamation-no-5902008.html">Freedom of the Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation No. 590</a> in 2008. This idealistic-sounding law's title belies its contents, because it enables the government to bring charges against "any person who is suspected of committing an offence through the mass media." Such offenses include the publication of statements critical of the legislative, executive or judicial authorities that are deemed false or defamatory. It is up to the attorney general to decide if the accused journalist should be detained on remand.  </p>

<p>The more recent adoption of terrorism as a tool for oppression has allowed the Ethiopian government to take much greater measures to eradicate opposition. The ruling regime has learned that the West needs its support for its own anti-terrorism efforts in the region, so much so that human rights abuses can be overlooked. Many argued against HR 2003, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.+2003:">The Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> when it was before the US Congress, because they felt that conditioning non-essential US aid to Ethiopia on the regime's attainment of certain human rights benchmarks would damage a relationship crucial to fighting terrorism. The reaction in Ethiopia was mixed, and the bill never came to a vote after reaching the US Senate.  </p>

<p>The Ethiopian government was encouraged by the bill's failure, and by its provision specifically exempting anti-terrorism funding from the human rights benchmarks. Thus the regime enhanced its restrictions on freedom of speech by hiding them behind Western-friendly terms, the most powerful of which turned out to be "terrorism." Recognizing the nation's geographic and political value as a strategic outpost for the West's War on Terror in East Africa and the Middle East, the Ethiopian government made a show of its dedication to fighting terrorism not only for its own benefit, but for "the peace and security of the world at large," in the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. The law cites Ethiopia's commitment to cooperation with those fighting terror all over the world, emphasizing its relationships with the African Union and the UN.  </p>

<p>After reading past these vows and laudations, however, the true purpose of the law becomes clear. Yes, they are dedicated to fighting terrorists, but who are the terrorists? In what amounts to a bill of attainder, once the legislature designates a person or group as a terrorist or terrorist organization, they lose their legal personality. Any assets or property are forfeited and liquidated immediately, without a judicial determination of guilt. The government can then officially ignore or punish what would otherwise be legitimate actions in a free society, such as lawsuits, protests or speech, as well as the actions of anyone who is deemed to have supported or aided the "terrorists" in any way.   </p>

<p>Under the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, encouraging terrorism can mean as small an act as showing "moral support" for a person or group deemed terroristic by the legislature. Publishing one's approval for one of the country's various ethnic rebel or political forces, for instance, could result in a 10-year minimum prison sentence, since these opposition groups have been declared terroristic in nature. Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ethiopia-counterterrorism-law-represses-free-speech-hrw.php">states</a> that it knows of 14 people who were arrested under the law in June for belonging to the Oromo Liberation Front. Meles's regime is built on ethnic federalism, and tends to favor certain ethnic groups, so designating opposition groups made up of the disfavored ethnicities as terrorist organizations helps Meles to stay in power. These designations could help support a future request for foreign military assistance in the event of an uprising, since such people could be characterized as committing terrorist attacks, not fighting for self-determination or democracy. Indeed, the authorization to control people or things threatened by or supportive of this so-called terrorism provides a convenient excuse for breaking up protests, suppressing speech and stripping people of the assets they would need to establish an effective opposition force.</p>

<p>The law takes advantage of this anti-terrorism theme to deprive people of due process in other ways, as well. The <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law.html">Criminal Procedure Code of Ethiopia</a> requires that an individual must be brought before a court of law within 48 hours of arrest, and that detention on remand may be no longer than 14 days. Warrants are required in a manner familiar to US lawyers, and search and seizure provisions are laid out in detail. Even the Freedom of the Mass Media and Access to Information Proclamation forbids remand for further investigation. The Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, however, allows detention for as long as four months, and authorities are explicitly permitted to use force to obtain evidence from the accused. Again justifying these actions by pointing to the importance of fighting terrorism, the law authorizes courts to ignore normal rules of evidence when trying suspects. Anonymous intelligence reports containing anonymous statements are admissible, as are all confessions, hearsay and information collected by any foreign entities. The accused are encouraged to name names and describe events in order to reduce their punishment, which could include the death penalty.  </p>

<p>Interestingly, Meles's own political party would have been considered a terrorist organization under his predecessor's regime, which it overthrew in 1991. Perhaps this legislation is not ironic then, but rather politically shrewd. All around him, other long-time leaders in the region are being called into question, and some have even been removed and detained. Meles may be worried, but perhaps such legal actions are tactical. After all, he knows firsthand how rulers are deposed. He did it once himself. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist James Nyawo, a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="http://www.nuigalway.ie/human_rights/">Irish Centre for Human Rights</a>, says that the African Union must emulate the EU and begin to confront human rights abuses, not only to prevent the organization from losing relevancy, but also to ensure that those who have committed crimes against humanity face justice...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jamesnyawo.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he arrests of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">Radovan Karadzic</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> and most recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">Goran Hadzic</a>, are examples of how regional institutions can play a pivotal role in the struggle against impunity. The three suspects were indicted by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=icty">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) over a decade ago for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out in the former Yugoslavia, but allegedly enjoyed protection from the Serbian government. However, sustained political and economic pressure from the international community, particularly the EU and the US, has caused the Serbian government to cooperate with the ICTY. This has bee successful, and now these former fugitives will face international justice in The Hague.</p>

<p>It could be argued that it was easier for the EU to exert pressure on Serbia because of the latter's interest to join the EU. In fact, one of the conditions set for the ratification of the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Agreement was Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY, especially in the arrest of the three fugitives. This condition was based on the EU's broader values of good governance, rule of law and respect of human rights enshrined in the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Treaty of Lisbon</a>. </p>

<p>In Africa, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ictr">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) is facing similar challenges in its efforts to secure the arrest of at least nine genocide fugitives. The most recent fugitive to be apprehended is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rwanda-genocide-leader-arrested-in-drc.php">Bernard Munyagishari</a>, who was arrested in May 2011 by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, together with the ICTR Office of the Prosecutor. The majority of the remaining fugitives are reported to be in African countries which are now considered to be "dens of g&eacute;nocidaires" by some in the Rwandan government. Kenya and Zimbabwe are among the countries suspected to be hosting these "g&eacute;nocidaires."</p>

<p>According to the ICTR Prosecutor's statement to the UN Security Council in June 2011, the ICTR has evidence of the fugitives' whereabouts. One of these fugitives, Protais Mpiranya, a former guard of the late Rwandan president Juv&eacute;nal Habiriyamana, is believed to be in Zimbabwe. However, the Zimbabwean government has denied this and has not cooperated with the ICTR. The Rwandan government also attempted to secure Mpiranya's arrest through bilateral channels without success. Though the Rwanda Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit has sent several international arrest warrants to the Zimbabwean government, they continue to be ignored. </p>

<p>Another high profile fugitive, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ictr-prosecutor-uses-new-rule-to-preserve-evidence-against-fugitive-genocide-financier.php">Felicien Kabuga</a>, is believed to be running businesses in Kenya and enjoying protection from either the Kenyan government or some influential individuals within Kenya. The reactivation of the ICTR-Kenya Police Task Force in November 2010 to track Kabuga was generally viewed as a positive development in securing his arrest. However, eight months have lapsed without any concrete results. </p>

<p>The fact that both UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/ictr/english/Resolutions/955e.htm">Resolution 955</a> and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/itr.htm">Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> include an obligation for all states to provide cooperation and judicial assistance to the tribunal means that Zimbabwe and Kenya are breaching their obligations under international law. Some claims even allege that Mpiranya is being protected by the Zimbabwean presidential guard, further complicating efforts to apprehend him. </p>

<p>What one finds missing in the work of the ICTR is the direct involvement of the African Union (AU) in overcoming the obstacles preventing the arrests of these fugitives. The AU is a continental institution consisting of 53 countries established to "to promote unity and solidarity among African States; to coordinate and intensify cooperation for development; to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States." The AU's vision is one of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena. </p>

<p>In the case of the ICTY, it is evident that the EU is actively involved in ensuring that those individuals accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity are brought to justice. It is difficult to find precise answers as to why the AU is not visible in the work of the ICTR. It may well be that the AU is addressing the problems using its famous quiet diplomacy strategy. Some may argue that unlike the EU, the AU does not have the tools to ensure that its member states comply with its decisions. However, such an argument is disproved by past actions of the organization, such as suspending the membership of some countries following military coups or disputed elections. For example, the AU has suspended <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mauritania+coup">Mauritania</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guinea+coup">Guinea</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madagascar">Madagascar</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=niger+coup">Niger</a> following military coups. In 2010, it also suspended the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ivory+coast">Ivory Coast</a> following the disputed presidential election. The legal basis for the suspension of these countries was found in Article 4(p) of the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/aboutau/constitutive_act_en.htm">Constitutive Act</a>, which condemns and rejects the unconstitutional change of government. </p>

<p>The AU's Constitutive Act provides a legal framework for the continental body to fight impunity. Article 4(h) and (o) authorize the organization to intervene in member states to stop war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity and prevent impunity. One of the major differences between the AU and the EU is that the latter appears to be ready, willing and capable to transform its principles into practical action. This is evident from how the EU managed to exercise pressure on Serbia, resulting in the arrest and transfer of the last fugitives to the ICTY. The question then becomes whether the AU will emulate this EU practice and pressure Kenya and Zimbabwe to hand in genocide suspects to the ICTR.</p>

<p>The Murambi and Ntarama Genocide Memorial Sites in Rwanda hold the bones, skulls, corpses and blood stained belongings of more than 30,000 women and children from the 1994 genocide. These sites illustrate the heinous nature of the crime of genocide and how genocide is not only crime against a single ethnic group or a country, but a crime against all of humanity. It is difficult to comprehend why some African leaders would protect genocide fugitives. The AU's failure to publicly exert pressure on Zimbabwe and Kenya to fully cooperate with the ICTR raises fundamental questions about its effectiveness and, to some extent, its relevance. It gives the impression that the continental body has been hijacked by self-centered bureaucrats who are perhaps more concerned about preserving their own safety and job security than promoting the continental interests outlined in the Constitutive Act. They appear to side with states at the expense of the victims. In addition, the preservation of the sacrosanct principle of state sovereignty seems to influence their policy decisions even when some states' behavior contradicts the AU's founding values and principles.</p>

<p>The threat that this poses to the AU is that, in a more globalized world where the "responsibility to protect" has become a cornerstone of state legitimacy, if it fails to act against states that fail to uphold this responsibility another organization will. This could inevitably lead to further marginalization of the union, as is already being witnessed in <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a>. The AU's indifference to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's actions against the ongoing unrest left open a gap which was filled by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/arab-league-calls-for-un-no-fly-zone-over-libya.php">Arab League</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">UN Security Council</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/nato-sued-for-libya-air-strike.php">NATO</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">International Criminal Court</a>. Ultimately, the AU's efforts to resolve the conflict significantly lagged behind those of other international organizations, rendering it largely irrelevant on the issue. </p>

<p>It is common knowledge that the Rwandan genocide happened due to the failure of the international community to take decisive action at a critical moment. Some members of the UN Security Council used their influence to downscale the peacekeeping forces at the moment that they were needed most, despite emphatic efforts from the Nigerian Ambassador to the UN, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, to maintain a UN presence in Rwanda. Given that Nigeria was a non-permanent member of the council, its influence was significantly less than other members, and the result was the death of between 800,000 and 1,000,000 Rwandans. Naturally, one would expect that the AU would have learned a lesson and been prepared to provide as much assistance as possible to reconstruct Rwanda, especially through playing a pivotal role in ensuring that fugitives in African countries are arrested and surrendered to the ICTR without delay. It is disheartening that the union has not lived up to these expectations.</p>

<p>Africa is renowned for its spirit of solidarity. This spirit was palpable during the struggles against colonial rule across the continent, when Ethiopians supported the anti-apartheid African National Congress in South Africa and Algerians provided military equipment to liberation movements in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Angola. African liberation movement leaders were given diplomatic passports by other African governments, allowing them to move around the world mobilizing support for their anti-colonial efforts. One would expect that the same determination and spirit of solidarity would surface in the face of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed against the African people. However, the sad story is that in most cases the opposite is true: African solidarity is used to protect the leaders committing these crimes, not the victims. This is very common in the debates surrounding the implementation of international criminal justice in Africa. Phrases such as selective targeting, neo-colonisation, encroachment of sovereignty or violation of immunity are often employed to prevent any form of accountability for the mass atrocities committed by state officials. What is repeatedly forgotten is that the victims of these crimes are Africans who deserve justice. </p>

<p>Perhaps it is time for the AU to bridge the gap between decisionmaking bodies and African public opinion. Such an change would increase the credibility of the AU, as its decisions and resolutions would come to reflect the views of the African population, and not just those of a few influential leaders. The AU's Pan-African parliament, which is supposed to serve this function, needs to be more proactive in influencing the decisions made by other AU bodies. The parliament needs to be the political barometer of African opinion on certain issues that affect the continent. In the case of Zimbabwe and Kenya, one would be interested in knowing the extent to which the people of those countries support their governments' decision to harbour those who are alleged to have committed genocide in Rwanda. </p>

<p>One hopes that the African Union will use its influence to encourage Zimbabwe and Kenya to cooperate with the ICTR and ensure that those suspected of committing genocide stand trial. Such a move would demonstrate that the continental body is not only paying lip service to ending impunity, but is actually ready to take concrete action to fulfill its obligations as outlined in the Constitutive Act. It would also silence those who are skeptical about the capacity of the AU to confront its own challenges.</p>

Forsyth County</a>. This 2-1 decision not only conflicts with previous US Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit cases, but also poses a danger to the long established tradition of legislative prayer&#8212;a tradition that, as the <em>Joyner</em> majority notes, "can bring together citizens of all backgrounds and encourage them to participate in the workings of their government."</p>

                <p>The issue in <em>Joyner</em> arose in response to a newly adopted policy in Forsyth County, North Carolina, that allowed religious leaders of all faiths the opportunity to offer an invocation before Board of Commissioners meetings. Importantly, the board's policy expressly stated that the opening prayer was not part of the public business and not intended to affiliate the board with any faith or religious denomination. The professed goal of the policy was to "acknowledge and express the Board's respect for the diversity of religious denominations and faiths represented and practiced among the citizens of Forsyth County." The board did not conduct any prior inquiry or review of the speakers' prayers. However, the board requested "the prayer opportunity not be exploited as an effort to convert others to [a] particular faith ... nor to disparage any faith or belief." Speakers were scheduled on a first-come, first-serve basis but could not speak more than twice a year. As the Fourth Circuit conceded, the policy was entirely neutral and not coercive.</p>

                <p>Still, despite the best efforts of the board, the Fourth Circuit found the policy unconstitutional because the prayers offered were predominantly Christian. Specifically, many invocation speakers referred to "Jesus Christ," which the Fourth Circuit considered impermissible because citizens with different beliefs might feel marginalized or ostracized by particularly sectarian prayer.</p>

                <p>Legislative prayer was first upheld in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3932615455276115963">Marsh v. Chambers</a>, where the US Supreme Court concluded that the Nebraska legislature's policy of employing a chaplain to begin each legislative session with a prayer was constitutionally permissible. In <em>Marsh</em>, the legislature had employed the same Presbyterian minister for sixteen years, paying him out of public funds for his services. Confirming the constitutionality of legislative prayer, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the opening of sessions of legislative and other deliberative public bodies with prayer is deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country. From colonial times through the founding of the Republic and ever since, the practice of legislative prayer has coexisted with the principles of disestablishment and religious freedom.</p>

                <p>Accordingly, the Supreme Court decided that when there is no indication that the opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one faith or belief, "the content of the prayer is not of concern to judges." In light of 200 years of unbroken practice in the US Congress, the court stated: "There can be no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with prayer has become part of the fabric of our society. To invoke Divine guidance on a public body entrusted with making laws is not ... an 'establishment' of religion or a step towards establishment."</p>

                <p>The Fourth Circuit has applied the principles set forth in <em>Marsh</em> on multiple occasions. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10517710685186626889">Wynne v. Town of Great Falls</a>, the court determined that a town council violated the Establishment Clause by consistently "invoking the name of 'Jesus Christ.' to the exclusion of deities associated with any other particular religious faith." Unlike in <em>Marsh</em>, however, town council members actually offered this sort of invocation&#8212;not paid chaplains. As the court of appeals recognized: "Marsh does not permit legislators ... to engage, as part of public business and for the citizenry as a whole, in prayers that contain explicit references to a deity in whose divinity only those of one faith believe." </p>

                <p>One year later, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9457995272132501336">Simpson v. Chesterfield</a>, the court upheld a county board of supervisors' policy that invited religious leaders from Chesterfield County, Virginia to offer an invocation before the evening board session. The board invited local religious leaders of all faiths to offer an invocation, and only stipulated that clerics not invoke the name of Jesus Christ in their prayers, as the board wanted to maintain a non-sectarian theme. Nevertheless, many clerics invoked sectarian terms, including "Lord God," "our creator," and "Jesus," among others&#8212;terms that relate to the Christian religion in particular. The Fourth Circuit upheld this policy, noting that the board had "no ability to dictate selection, the clergy itself control[led] it by choosing to respond or not." </p>

                <p>In light of these cases, the Fourth Circuit's decision in <em>Joyner</em> appears out of place. The Forsyth County policy accords with <em>Marsh</em>, as there is no indication that the board used the invocation as an opportunity to proselytize or advance any particular belief over another. Rather, similar to the policy in <em>Simpson</em>, the board removed itself from the selection process by opening the invocation to all religious leaders in Forsyth County. Unlike <em>Simpson</em>, however, the Fourth Circuit invalidated this neutral policy merely because many of the self-selected speakers mentioned Jesus Christ. The court compared these subtle remarks to the egregious endorsement of religion in <em>Wynne</em>. Ignoring the fact that religious leaders from all faiths were invited to speak, the court declared the policy impermissible because "citizens should come to public meetings confident in the assurance that government plays no favorites in matters of faith but welcomes the participation of all."</p>

                <p>Acknowledging the neutrality of the policy, the court seemingly invalidated it because a majority of the religious leaders used particularly Christian terminology. Nowhere in <em>Marsh</em> does the Supreme Court mandate that legislative prayer must be free from all mention of particular faiths. <em>Marsh</em> only requires that speakers not use the invocation as opportunity to proselytize or advance one religion over another. Hence, the Fourth Circuit misapplied precedent and decided <em>Joyner</em> incorrectly because the board set forth a neutral policy that invited followers of all faiths the opportunity to offer an invocation so long as they refrained from proselytizing or advancing one particular religious view over another. </p>

                <p>Furthermore, the <em>Joyner</em> decision has the dangerous effect of directing legislatures to review and presumably censor invocations offered by religious leaders. The court in <em>Marsh</em> expressly prohibited this type of parsing activity by the government. Nevertheless, if <em>Joyner</em> stands, government officials will be forced to review and censor invocation remarks to avoid violations of the First Amendment. This sort of government involvement with religion is the very activity the Establishment Clause is designed to prevent. </p>

                <p>Judge Paul Niemeyer, dissenting in <em>Joyner</em>, best explains the potential dangers of the decision:<blockquote>When offering legislative prayers in which the Divine Being is publicly asked for guidance and a blessing of the legislators, religious leaders will hereafter have to refrain from referencing the Divine Being with the inspired or revealed name, according to each leader's religion. The majority's decree commands that every legislative prayer reference only "God" or some "nonsectarian ideal," supposedly because other appellations might offend. Thus, in a stated sensitivity to references that might identify the religion practiced by the religious leader, the majority has dared to step in and regulate the language of prayer&#8212;the sacred dialogue between humankind and God. Such a decision treats prayer agnostically; reduces it to civil nicety; hardly accommodates the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in <em>Marsh v. Chambers</em>. ... Most frightfully, it will require secular legislative and judicial bodies to evaluate and parse particular religious prayers under an array of criteria identified by the majority. ...</p>

                <p>Prayer includes the articulation of words addressed to the Divine Being in accordance with the beliefs of the prayer-giver's religion. Because how one should address the Divine Being and what one should say cannot be determined by a civil court of law, efforts to do so would inevitably place courts in the untenable role of regulating the content of religious expression. And to interfere with a prayer-giver's form of address during an invocation is no less intrusive. In the Jewish and Christian traditions, Moses asked God, when receiving the law, how he was to refer to God in relating the law to his people. God told Moses that he must say to the Israelites, "I am who I am" and therefore he must say, "I am has sent me to you." God also told Moses to say to the Israelites, "YHWH [the sacred and unspeakable name of the Lord], the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you." God concluded, "This is my name forever, and this is my title for all generations." Exodus 3:13-15. Christians call on the Divine Being with the names God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. Muslims have 99 names for God, but Allah is the supreme appellation. Yet the majority opinion now directs all religious leaders to forsake these names to accommodate some "civil," court-shaped religion. ...</p>

                <p>[T]he majority's logic in prohibiting only an invocation of Jesus during prayers in Forsyth County, but otherwise allowing other prayer content, escapes me. Prayer includes the invocation of the Divine Being according to the understanding of the religion, not the court. Would the majority thus preclude a Christian prayer invoking the Holy Spirit or Pax Christi or the King of kings? Would the majority deny a prayer invoking the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Whatever name is spoken, it is spoken by the religious leader in accord with the leader's religion to call on the Divine Being. Yet we now legislate, based on the imprecise notion of nonsectarianism, bowing to political correctness or universal inoffensiveness and censuring only what offended Joyner and Blackmon on December 17, 2007, without regard to the dangers of governmental censorship of religious expression.</p>

                <p>I respectfully submit that we must maintain a sacred respect of each religion, and when a group of citizens comes together, as does the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners, and manifests that sacred respect&#8212;allowing the prayers of each to be spoken in the religion's own voice&#8212;we must be glad to let it be. The ruling today intermeddles most subjectively without a religiously sensitive or constitutionally compelled standard. This surely cannot be a law for mutual accommodation, and it surely is not required by the Establishment Clause.</blockquote></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On July 14, 2011, Rupert Murdoch's media empire came under intense pressure as key members of Congress <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/07/us-lawmakers-urge-probe-of-news-corp-911-hacking-claim.php">called for an investigation</a> into the allegations that one of the media mogul's US-based companies may have violated American bribery and corruption laws. It is not clear yet whether Congress will ultimately respond to the claims that News Corp. paid bribes to UK law enforcement officers to obtain information; however, the potential implications for Murdoch could be disastrous if such claims were prosecuted by the US authorities under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/47mcrm.htm">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977</a> (FCPA), which prohibits US nationals and firms from making "corrupt" payments to foreign officials for the purpose of securing or maintaining business. Transparency International, a global civil society organization fighting corruption, <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/g8y8k3v3xedy">claims</a> that it is impossible to quantify the total amount of bribery in the world as it is not publicly recorded. "No one knows exactly how much money is being 'invested' in corrupt officials annually. And bribes do not take only monetary form: favours, services, presents and so on are just as common."

Congress enacted the FCPA in 1977 to stop the bribery of foreign officials as these business practices were against the integrity of the US business model. The legislative history of the FCPA clearly demonstrates that this kind of corruption was rampant and ran the "gamut from bribery of high foreign officials in order to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government to so-called facilitating payments that allegedly were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties." The FCPA imposes fines and criminal sanctions while its anti-bribery provisions prohibit direct bribes and bribes of a domestic concern and its officials through intermediaries. At the same time, the tax code does not allow deductions for bribes while issued securities must meet the accounting standards set forth at <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sec_15_00000078---m000-.html">15 USC § 78m(b)(2)</a>. Specifically, the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions prohibit any issuer of publicly traded securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2B.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, "from making use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value would be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person or securing any improper advantage."

Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have the authority to bring charges against those that violate the FCPA. US companies and companies with operations in the US must, therefore, be well versed with the provisions of the FCPA and must take company-wide steps to prevent violations whenever executives and/or consultants transact business in foreign markets. Corruption in many countries is so prevalent that it is inconceivable to expect to finalize a contract unless certain "arrangements" are made. There is frequently a dilemma for US companies in that competition really means suitcases of cash being passed to officials and the transfer of funds to offshore bank accounts. These activities are often identified as "consulting fees," and are all targeted at winning contracts through bribery. What often secures contracts is the personal relationship with a government official and the financing of such a relationship (through consulting fees) rather than the quality of the products and services or competitive pricing. The current commentary includes three cases involving Siemens, Daimler and Johnson &amp; Johnson, all having been charged with violations of the FCPA. Both the SEC and the DOJ brought suits against them alleging that they promoted their worldwide business through bribes and corruption.

<strong><span>The Siemens Case</span></strong>

On December 12, 2008, the SEC filed an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20829.pdf">action</a> [PDF] against Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (Siemens), alleging that the Munich-based company violated the FCPA's anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions. On the same day, the DOJ filed an <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/siemens-ag-info.pdf">action</a> [PDF] against Siemens in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging violations of the FCPA and detailing the manner, methods and conduct of Siemens in securing contracts through bribes and corruption. As part of the settlement with the SEC, Siemens offered to pay a total of $1.6 billion in disgorgement and fines, the largest amount a company has ever paid to resolve corruption-related charges. Specifically, Siemens agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to the SEC, $450 million in criminal fines to the DOJ and a fine of €395 million (approximately $572 million) to the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany. In October of 2007, Siemens also paid a fine of €201 million (approximately $291 million) to the Munich Prosecutor.

The SEC and the DOJ complaints describe the web of corruption in graphic detail. Prior to 1999, German law did not prohibit foreign bribes and companies could deduct such payments made in foreign countries as expenditures. Despite foreign laws that prohibited bribery, Siemens had payment mechanisms in place which included cash and off-book accounts that were used to make the necessary payments to win contracts. The SEC complaint describes how "Siemens developed a network of payment mechanisms designed to funnel money through third parties in a way that obscured the purpose and ultimate recipient of the funds." There were no internal controls that targeted corruption-related activities and there was a consensus on bribery within the company at all levels of senior management, compliance, internal audit, legal and finance departments.

From 1999 to 2003, the managing board of Siemens "was ineffective in implementing controls to address constraints imposed by Germany's 1999 adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anti-bribery convention that outlawed foreign bribery." Siemens was also ineffective in meeting the US regulatory and anti-bribery requirements following its March 12, 2001 listing on the NYSE. The SEC complaint alleged that "Siemens made 4,283 separate payments totaling approximately $1.4 billion to bribe government officials in foreign countries throughout the world. An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement."

Facing unprecedented fines and criminal sanctions unless it cooperated, Siemens retained Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, a US-based law firm to conduct an internal investigation and to share information with the federal authorities.

As German and American investigators worked together to develop leads, Debevoise and its partners dedicated more than 300 lawyers, forensic analysts and staff members to untangle thousands of payments across the globe, according to the court records. American investigators and the Debevoise lawyers conducted more than 1,700 interviews in 34 countries. They collected more than 100 million documents, creating special facilities in China and Germany to house records from that single investigation. Debevoise and an outside auditor racked up 1.5 million billable hours, according to court documents. Siemens has said that the internal inquiry and related restructurings have cost it more than $1 billion.

<strong><span>The Daimler Case</span></strong>

On March 22, 2010, the SEC filed an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2010/comp-pr2010-51.pdf">action</a> [PDF] against Daimler AG (Daimler), and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, alleging that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA by making illicit payments, directly or indirectly, to foreign government officials in order to secure and maintain business worldwide. On April 1, 2010, Daimler agreed to pay $91.4 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's charges and also agreed to pay $93.6 million in fines to settle charges in separate criminal proceedings filed by the DOJ. The conduct of Daimler was similar to the business practices utilized by Siemens as it created a labyrinth of payments to government officials to avoid detection by US authorities.

The SEC's complaint alleged that Daimler used bribes to promote government sales in Russia, China, Vietnam, Nigeria, Hungary, Latvia, Croatia and Bosnia.

Among other means, Daimler used dozens of ledger accounts, known internally as "interne Fremdkonten" or "internal third party accounts" to maintain credit balances for the benefit of government officials. These credit balances were controlled by Daimler subsidiaries or outside third parties, including foreign government officials or Daimler's dealers, distributors or other agents who were at times used as intermediaries to make payments to foreign government officials.

According to the SEC:
<blockquote>[T]he accounts were funded through several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as "price surcharges," "price inclusions," or excessive commissions. Daimler also used artificial discounts or rebates on sales contracts to effectuate bribes. In those instances, all or a portion of the discount was kicked back through a ledger account to a foreign government official, rather than credited to the purchasing government customer.</blockquote>
The SEC also alleges that Daimler paid $56 million in improper payments over a period of more than 10 years:
<blockquote>The payments involved more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries. Daimler earned $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $90 million in illegal profits through these tainted sales transactions, which involved at least 6,300 commercial vehicles and 500 passenger cars. Daimler also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with direct and indirect sales of motor vehicles and spare parts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program.</blockquote>
Daimler did not maintain proper books and records and had inadequate internal controls to detect and prevent these payments, all of which were in violation of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act. According to the SEC's complaint:
<blockquote>[T]he bribery permeated several major business units and subsidiaries, was sanctioned by members of Daimler's management, and continued during the course of the SEC's investigation. Daimler's corrupt practices were authorized by or known to the former heads of Daimler's Overseas Sales and Commercial Vehicles departments, the former head of Daimler Export and Trade Finance (a subsidiary of Daimler Financial Services), and the former heads of Daimler subsidiaries in numerous foreign countries.</blockquote>
<strong><span>The Johnson &amp; Johnson Case</span></strong>

On April 7, 2011, the SEC filed an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2011/comp21922.pdf">action</a> [PDF] against Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) that it violated the FCPA by bribing public doctors in several European countries and paying kickbacks to Iraq to illegally obtain business. The SEC alleges that:
<blockquote>[S]ince at least 1998, subsidiaries of the New Brunswick, N.J.-based pharmaceutical, consumer product, and medical device company paid bribes to public doctors in Greece who selected J&amp;J surgical implants, public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland who awarded contracts to J&amp;J, and public doctors in Romania to prescribe J&amp;J pharmaceutical products. J&amp;J subsidiaries also paid kickbacks to Iraq to obtain 19 contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program.</blockquote>
As part of the settlement, J&amp;J agreed to pay more than $48.6 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to settle the SEC's charges and to pay a $21.4 million fine to the DOJ to settle criminal charges.

<strong><span>Recommendations</span></strong>

These bribery cases only represent the tip of the iceberg of FCPA violations committed by global enterprises in the course of their worldwide operations. It is not easy to compete with slush funds paid under the table and it is even more difficult to establish a presence in places where corruption is the only business model. US companies vying for business abroad are at a great disadvantage as they cannot compete with foreign companies that are engaging in corrupt practices without being bound by legal prohibitions imposed by their home countries. Needless to say, those that receive bribes are as much responsible as those that offer them and a global enforcement initiative must be promoted on two levels.

First, there must be an international mechanism that uniformly targets individuals and companies that pay bribes. Specifically, there has to be a system that disqualifies companies from doing business in markets where they engaged in corruption, in addition to all the penalties and criminal charges that may be brought under the FCPA. As part of the settlement agreement with US authorities, Siemens, Daimler and J&amp;J should also have been temporarily restricted from engaging in new business in countries where bribes were used to obtain contracts. Disgorgement of past profits, penalties and fines may not be sufficient to discourage future violations, and there must be an uncompromising approach to violations that entails stiff penalties on all aspects of the operational spectrum. This way, the authority of the FCPA and similar US anti-corruption mechanisms will be enhanced.

The second component must be delegated to the countries where officials accepted bribes; each country must prosecute such conduct consistent with the domestic legislation. There has to be some uniformity, however, and failure by the authorities of a country to adequately deal with the corrupt officials must yield a backlash in terms of future enforcement actions.

Finally, stronger incentives for whistleblowers must be afforded that include significant payouts from the overall recoveries, confidentiality measures that truly protect the identity of such individuals, no prosecution for crimes relevant to the disclosed conduct and the creation of employment opportunities in government and/or organizations that combat corruption.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=934">Chibli Mallat</a> of Harvard Law School says that recent reports of the operation resulting in the death of Osama Bin Laden have revealed that his killing violated longstanding doctrines of international law prohibiting killing outside the context of hostilities...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/chiblimallat.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> never had the slightest sympathy for Osama Bin Laden, who was the product of a Saudi governance system monstrous to basic humanity. It is the women of Saudi Arabia who affirm&#8212;at daily risk of being beaten, incarcerated and humiliated&#8212;that nonviolence is the right way to speak to the tyranny of the Saudi system. Killing three thousand civilians in New York is not. </p>

<p>On the evening of September 11, 2001, I appeared on a popular television talk show in the Arab world, <em>Kalam al-Nas</em>, to discuss the tragedy that had taken place that day. The magnitude of the attack was evident, and I had to think quickly about what to say on television, amidst news that celebrations had broken out in some Palestinian refugee camps. It had been a few weeks since the start of a case against the Israeli officials involved in the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre in the Palestinian refugee camps of Beirut. On September 11, it was of paramount importance to show that these crimes were in the same category, and that the Palestinian victims would lose all moral ground if they did not see the horror of the 9/11 massacre in a similar light. This reinforced the long held notion that how we perceive the impact of an event is essential to the way the world will remember it for decades to come. </p>

<p>One mistake in this perception and the case veers off to a defeating logic. It was clear that what had happened that day in New York and Pennsylvania was a crime against humanity, and the message I wanted to convey immediately on live television was two-fold. In an initial reaction, caution was needed as it was not yet clear that Bin Laden was responsible for the massacre. More importantly for my Palestinian and wider Arab audience, it was essential to underline the similarity between the crimes perpetrated at Sabra and Shatila in 1982 and those in the US in 2001. Eventually, all signs of celebration ceased in the camps, and the Sabra and Shatila victims won their case in February 2003, though the law on universal jurisdiction was later modified to retroactively halt the Belgian proceedings.</p>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killing</a> of Osama Bin Laden on May 1, 2011 is an event with a similar historic importance, feeding back on the world trauma that began ten years earlier. Rules must be applied evenhandedly, and in the absence of details on the operation, I had held back my initial unease towards the snippets of news reported in the press. The question was simple: what were the exact instructions to the team? Were they told to arrest Bin Laden if they could without risk to their lives, or were they told to kill him regardless? The former would conform to the laws of war; the latter would be in open breach of an established principle. Killing an enemy <em>hors de combat</em>, or "outside the fight," is a war crime.</p>

<p>This week the most precise answer to date emerged. In an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_schmidle">article</a> by Nicholas Schmidle in <em>The New Yorker</em>, the critical moment is recounted in the following terms:<blockquote>A second SEAL stepped into the room and trained the infrared laser of his M4 on bin Laden's chest. The Al Qaeda chief, who was wearing a tan shalwar kameez and a prayer cap on his head, froze; he was unarmed. "There was never any question of detaining or capturing him&#8212;it wasn't a split-second decision. No one wanted detainees," the special-operations officer told me. (The Administration maintains that had bin Laden immediately surrendered he could have been taken alive.) Nine years, seven months, and twenty days after September 11th, an American was a trigger pull from ending bin Laden's life. The first round, a 5.56-mm. bullet, struck bin Laden in the chest. As he fell backward, the SEAL fired a second round into his head, just above his left eye. On his radio, he reported, "For God and country&#8212;Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo." After a pause, he added, "Geronimo E.K.I.A."&#8212;"enemy killed in action."</blockquote>"Enemy killed" is correct. The enemy category is the right one, but it does not matter here whether Bin Laden was a common criminal, an enemy combatant or an enemy soldier. The rule taught to our law students is that it is forbidden to kill an enemy <em>hors de combat</em>. This French phrase included in <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/470?opendocument">Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions</a> is a simple and clear term of art. It is not just a matter of whether he "immediately surrendered"&#8212;"clearly expressing an intention to surrender" is only one of three conditions under this rule. The other two are whether he is "in the power of an adverse Party," or has "been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and therefore is incapable of defending himself." </p>

<p>One is accustomed to constant paradoxes in teaching the laws of war, replete with dilemmas as masterfully shown in Michael Walzer's <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Just_and_unjust_wars.html?id=kZnx7WVJbeUC">Just and Unjust Wars</a>. Paul Kahn has pointed out another powerful paradox of the modern use of violence: the state, as well as the individual, may kill but not torture. Here there is no grey. Objective circumstances are important, and they point significantly to the fact that Bin Laden, at this particular moment of the battle, was <em>hors de combat</em>. While his courier and his sons had carried arms and tried to shoot at the Navy SEALs, Bin Laden had no weapons, his wives who had tried to intercede had been removed from the scene, and he froze. </p>

<p>The account leaves no doubt as to what happened, and what the orders were: "There was never any question of detaining or capturing him&#8212;it wasn't a split-second decision. No one wanted detainees." The US government ordered Bin Laden killed, regardless of the circumstances. </p>

<p>The information in <em>The New Yorker</em> article comes as a great disappointment. Decisions on the Abbottabad operation came from the top: the Navy SEAL who shot Bin Laden is liable, but the command he received carries a far heavier responsibility, and it rests squarely with the US president. </p>

<p>Reading through the article, one can only be awed by the amount of wisdom and responsibility carried by President Barack Obama in the days preceding the raid: no rush through decisions, he once said he wanted to "sleep on it." No use of air raids or of drones to flatten Bin Laden's suspected residence, in part to avoid collateral damage. American soldiers' lives were put at risk despite this much easier alternative. No children were killed in the compound, and Bin Laden's wife who threw herself at the soldiers was not killed but shot in the calf; she and another wife were removed from the scene by a SEAL despite the risk to his own life.</p>

<p>Yet, it is plain that Obama was on the wrong side of the laws of war. Bin Laden froze, and was shot twice: once in the chest then once again to be sure. The shoot to kill order was absolute. That order is in plain breach of international law.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Megan Crouch, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2013, spent the summer working at the <a href="http://www.humanrights.mw/">Malawi Human Rights Resource Centre</a>. She writes on the ability of rural villagers to access the justice system in Malawi and argues that new legislation to address this issue might improve the situation, if implemented properly...<hr height='1'><strong>T</strong>he number of people in Malawi that have access to the legal system is few and far between. This is not new to Malawians; the government has strived to remedy this problem since changing to a multiparty democracy in 1994. While in the past the government has been unable to find a solution, it recently passed the <a href="http://www.nationmw.net/index.php?option=com_rokdownloads&view=file&Itemid=357&id=138:local-courts-bill">Local Courts Bill</a>, which may have an effect on how the justice system is accessed. </p>

<p>In 1964, Malawi gained independence from the UK and two years later it became a one-party state. The legal system at the time consisted of both a conventional court system and a traditional court system, running parallel to one another. In 1969, the traditional courts were given jurisdiction over criminal cases. Soon after, these courts developed into the primary means of law enforcement. Hastings Banda, the "President for Life," used these traditional courts to prosecute political opponents and accordingly they became exceedingly corrupted. </p>

<p>When the government became a multiparty democracy in 1994, Banda's successor abolished the traditional courts. Only the conventional legal system remained, and to this day it is still the only court system used in Malawi. The Malawian legal system has three different levels of courts: magistrate courts, high courts, and the Supreme Court of Appeal. The magistrate courts are the lowest level of courts and handle both civil and criminal matters within their jurisdiction. They are located at the district and city level, with about one court in each of the nation's twenty-seven districts and one to two in its four cities. The High Courts of Malawi preside over the magistrate courts. These courts have unlimited jurisdiction over criminal and civil matters and also hear appeals from the magistrate courts. They are situated in the four cities of Malawi. The Supreme Court of Appeal is the highest appellate court, and it hears appeals from the high courts and other tribunals. </p>

<p>Despite the variety, none of these courts function at the village level. Even with the magistrate courts situated at the district level, many people still do not have access to the justice system. The lack of any legal structure in the rural areas of Malawi is one of the main reasons why people are not able to access the justice system. For those who live in a village, the closest magistrate court might be 25 to 30 miles away. Most villagers cannot afford a personal vehicle, and public transportation in rural areas is non-existent. The only options available to villagers are walking, biking or hitchhiking to a court. Furthermore, it is necessary to arrive at the courthouse a couple days in advance of the trial starting. This requires one to raise money for food, accommodation and anything else one might need while travelling away from their home. In the event the magistrate court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, the only other option is to bring the case before the High Court in the closest city, which can be over 200 miles away. All of this puts a huge burden on villagers and makes it nearly impossible for them to access the justice system.</p>

<p>February 2011 brought a potential change to those living in the rural outskirts of Malawi. Parliament passed the local courts legislation in an attempt to address this problem. According to the bill's memorandum, the act "seeks to introduce a new genre of courts ... with the primary function of dispensing familiar and affordable justice for the ordinary Malawian in line with the spirit of the Constitution which aims at enhancing the right of access to justice by all citizens." In 2009, the Special Law Commission was appointed to review the old Traditional Courts Act in light of the current Malawi legal system. The commission concluded that local courts could benefit society by providing a point from which to access justice in rural areas. As a result of this report, a proposal was created for a bill that would reintroduce these courts.</p>

<p>The Local Courts will be subordinate to the High Courts. This is different from how the traditional courts previously functioned. In the past, the traditional courts had no interaction with the High Courts or the Supreme Court of Appeal. According to the new act, two levels of courts will be constructed. At the lower level, there will be the multiple local courts established in each of Malawi's 27 districts. These will be located near, if not in, villages, making it easier for people living in rural areas to access them. Appellate courts, called the District Appeals Local Courts, will be created in each district to hear appeals from the Local Courts.</p>

<p>A chairperson will head both the Local Courts and the District Appeals Local Courts. The chairperson must be at least 35 years old, in possession of a Malawi School Certificate of Education and have adequate knowledge of the customary law of the area in which the court presides over. It is not necessary for the chairperson to hold a degree in law. The chairperson must also have adequate command of the language of the court but also be proficient in English. Furthermore, the Local Courts will have a panel of assessors that will advise the court in civil matters concerning customary law; however the advice will not be binding. The requirements for the assessors are similar to those of the chairperson, but the assessor must be at least 50 years old and does not need to hold a Malawi School Certificate of Education.</p>

<p>The Local Courts will have jurisdiction over criminal matters, in accordance with Malawi Criminal Procedure and Evidence Code, and over most civil matters. Given the history of Malawi, the creators of this bill have been conscious of the past and have specified certain civil matters the courts will not have the authority to hear. The Local Courts will not have jurisdiction over any civil case at customary law: when the title or ownership of customary land is in question, if the case relates to inheritance of deceased property, wherein the guardianship or custody of infants is in question, if the case relates to issues of witchcraft under the Witchcraft Act, or if the case relates to chieftaincy. This is to help limit corruption of the courts. </p>

<p>While the bill has been created to benefit Malawians, many have concerns with the new legal regime. The largest concern is fear that the courts will still be used for political ends and oppression. Looking at the current government, Malawians are not mistaken for fearing the misuse of the local courts. Recently, President Bingu wa Mutharika shut down the main college campus within a moment's notice and kept it closed for 107 days because a teacher was explaining the government's role in Malawi's current economic crisis. Bingu and his party also <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/malawi-passes-law-permitting-government-to-ban-media.php">passed a bill</a> that gives him control over what is published in the newspaper, limiting the freedom of the press despite its guarantee in the Malawi Constitution. Many Malawians fear the courts will once again be used for persecution of dissenting views. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, if the courts are used to further justice, the new act could be a step closer to providing all Malawians access to the legal system. Desmond Kaunda, a Commissioner for the Malawi Human Rights Commission and Director of the Malawi Human Rights Resource Centre, will spend six months researching whether the local courts will help increase access to justice and benefit society. He has his own concerns, but Kaunda believes the best thing Malawians can do to improve their access to justice is support the bill and make sure the traditional authorities presiding over the courts are held accountable. </p>

<p>A major benefit provided by these local courts is their accessibility to the rural population. They can help increase villagers' access to justice, not only through their proximity, but also through the fact that the proceedings will be carried out in the local language of the village. Simple proceedings may not even require the services of a lawyer, and many of the typical delays associated with the formal justice system will likely not be encountered. Hearings should run more smoothly and quickly, allowing more cases to be heard. </p>

<p>Even with all the potential benefits that could result from the new local courts, many Malawians hope the bill will not take effect. It has only been 17 years since the change from an authoritarian regime to a multiparty system. People have not forgotten what they suffered during Banda's presidency and the ends for which the traditional courts were used. The outcome of this new bill is yet to be determined, as it is yet to take effect and the new courts still have not been established. Only time will tell whether it is a benefit or a detriment to society.</p>

<p>In the end, what is important is the fact that the government is attempting to address Malawi's access to justice problem. The Constitution of Malawi guarantees that every person shall have access to justice and have the right to bring their issues before a court. While it is true that many women and men in Malawi are still provided with that constitutional right, there may be hope for the future with the new Local Courts Act.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Johanna Nestor, University of Pittsburgh School of Law Class of 2012, is currently working as a law clerk for the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Florida. She writes on the issue of astroturfing and businesses using false and misleading information to bolster their reputations in online forums, and the role state attorneys general can play in discouraging this behavior...<hr height='1'><strong>I</strong>t is increasingly common for a prospective buyer of a product or service to seek out the reputation of the company online. As such, there are many websites that operate with "user generated content" or information that is created and uploaded by members of the general public. The Internet serves as an excellent resource for customers that wish to review and share their experiences on product review websites or web boards; those with negative experiences can also take their grievances to complaints boards. Along the same vein, customer testimonials can be used to build trust by showing prospective customers a company has been historically reliable. </p>

<p>While this is an excellent tool, when searching out reviews consumers should be cautious in deciding what they believe. Nonetheless, while caution is essential, individuals should not have to deal with misleading or false information. In 2009, the Attorney General of New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2009/july/july14b_09.html">settled</a> with the cosmetic surgery company, Lifestyle Lift, over false positive reviews posted on websites. Lifestyle Lift employees posed as consumers on product review message boards, attacked posters with negative reviews and also created at least 9 separate websites that appeared to be created by prior satisfied customers. These websites contained customer testimonials, before and after pictures, diaries of the procedure and a comments section, and they were made to look as if they were unaffiliated with Lifestyle Lift. While the pictures were actual Lifestyle Lift customers, the diaries, customer testimonials and all the comments from "independent users" where in fact created by Lifestyle Lift employees. </p>

<p>Lifestyle Lift also posted false positive information on user generated content websites, such as the review board <a href="http://www.realself.com/">RealSelf.com</a>, which Lifestyle Lift later settled with. Furthermore, Lifestyle Lift not only posted false reviews, they also created a rival website made to look like a third party review board, called cosmetictoday.com, where Lifestyle Lift employees posted positive reviews. This website also allowed for independent third parties to post, but critical reviews were often removed. Lifestyle Lift also paid for advertisements through search engines that increased the number of customers brought to its review board. </p>

<p>Many review boards have terms of service that outline the ways in which visitors may use their websites. For example, RealSelf's terms make it clear that it would not tolerate reviews by employees for the benefit of their employers, or false, misleading or exaggerated positive reviews, and this is true of the majority of product and service review boards. However, in their terms of use most websites also state that they are not responsible for the validity of their postings. While this makes it difficult to police and enforce the authenticity of information, the good news is that the offices of attorneys general can help to regulate astroturfing by going after companies who engage in this behavior. In the Lifestyle Lift case the New York Attorney General's Office was able to get $300,000 in penalties and costs, in addition to an injunction banning Lifestyle Life from further posting anonymous reviews online and a requirement to disclose its affiliation in any online promotion or website.</p>

<p>Moreover, government entities like the attorney general can obtain identity information for online postings and website ownership through properly issued subpoenas. For most review boards, whenever a consumer creates a profile or makes a post, his Internet Protocol (IP) address and a related email address are stored. In the terms of service, users are generally advised of this. IP addresses can be traced back to an individual by identifying and subpoenaing the Internet Service Provider (ISP). Email addresses used to create a profile usually have IP logs stored by the email address provider. Additionally, businesses generally have a large enough account to have a static, as opposed to dynamic, IP addresses assigned by their ISP, meaning that a business may have a specific IP address that does not change, making tracing easier. With regard to websites, even though it is easy to restrict the ability to look up their registration information, this information is also discoverable through a subpoena. Therefore, even though the Internet can seem to provide an anonymous forum for false posters to hide behind, information is recorded and posters can be identified.</p>

<p>An interesting and recent development in consumer protection is that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has for the first time settled with a consumer for providing a false and misleading customer-testimonial for a company. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17846287472327686030">FTC v. Dalbey</a>, the FTC alleged that Russell Dalbey and his wife defrauded customers and made misleading claims through his company that provides educational materials on how to earn a substantial income and accumulate wealth in the real estate market by earning commission on seller-financed promissory notes. The FTC alleged that Dalbey aired various versions of an infomercial called <em>Winning in the Cash Flow Business</em>, which offered various materials such as booklets, CDs, and DVDs, with prices ranging from $40-160, promising to teach consumers how to find and make money brokering notes. These infomercials included customer testimonials, which stated that through using Dalbey's system they had made substantial amounts of money. One testimonial claimed to make as much as $1.2 million in 30 days. </p>

<p>Marsha Kellogg gave one such testimonial. She stated that she made $79,975.11 in one deal and $134,573 in total earnings. In reality, Kellogg had earned only $29,975.01 in the deal and her total earnings were $84,573. The complaint alleged that Kellogg made a representation that was false and misleading, and therefore constituted a deceptive practice in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2_20_I.html">Federal Trade Commission Act</a>, as well as a false representation as to the benefits of goods or services in violation of Colorado law. Kellogg chose to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0923062/110531russelldalbeystip.pdf">settle</a> [PDF] the complaint with the FTC and entered an order whereby she agreed to be permanently enjoined from misrepresenting the length of time, and ease with which she, and others, can find, broker and make money through promissory notes. She also agreed to have her prior statement withdrawn and to cooperate with the FTC and the Colorado Attorney General's Office in the further investigation of Dalbey's operation.  </p>

<p>Without a doubt, a business should be concerned with its reputation online, and it can only be expected that a business would present and promote flattering information to prospective customers whether it be through online customer testimonials or infomercials. Lifestyle Lift acknowledged that negative online reviews and criticisms posed a threat to their business because it painted the company in a negative light. However, when a company deliberately provides false information and has its employees pose as anonymous satisfied customers, it crosses into an impermissible realm. While Lifestyle Lift and Russell Dalbey have completely different business models, they both engaged in providing customer testimonials through various outlets that were either false, misleading or that inadequately disclosed the entities they were created by or affiliated with. The good news is that the FTC and the attorneys general of various states are taking steps to help curb such behavior in the future. </p>

Forsyth County</em>, a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-county-board-meeting-prayers-violated-first-amendment.php">striking down</a> a North Carolina county council's practice of having clergy from the community open council meetings with explicitly Christian prayers. Whitehead's conclusion&#8212;that the decision conflicts with precedents of both the US Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit&#8212;rests on a misreading of the case law and warrants clarification.</p>

                <p>Whitehead began by discussing the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3932615455276115963">Marsh v. Chambers</a>, which upheld a state legislature's practice of having a paid chaplain open its sessions with prayer. He correctly noted that the Court held that prayers are permissible so long as they do not "proselytize or advance any one faith or belief." He omitted, however, the important fact that the prayers at issue in that case withstood this test because the chaplain had "removed all references to Christ" over three years earlier and had since limited himself to delivering inclusive, "nonsectarian" prayers containing elements of the "American Civil Religion," rather than concepts or deities particular to any single faith. </p>

                <p>Whitehead also did not to mention a more recent Supreme Court decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8862797267664944769">Allegheny County v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter</a>, in which the Court reiterated that the ecumenism of the chaplain's prayers was central to the holding in <em>Marsh</em>. The Court in <em>Allegheny</em> explained that "not even the 'unique history' of legislative prayer can justify contemporary legislative prayers that have the effect of affiliating government with any one specific faith or belief. The legislative prayers involved in <em>Marsh</em> did not violate this principle because the particular chaplain had 'removed all references to Christ.'" In contrast, during the nineteen months that elapsed after enactment of the policy at issue in <em>Joyner</em>, almost 80 percent of the delivered prayers referred to "Jesus," "Jesus Christ," "Christ," or "Savior." Many of the prayers did not stop there: several included discussions about specific tenets of the Christian religion, including the crucifixion and the virgin birth. To make matters worse, not a single non-Christian appeared as a prayer-giver. Given these facts, the Fourth Circuit was eminently correct in concluding that the county's practice advanced a single religion, and thus ran afoul of Supreme Court precedent. </p>

                <p>Whitehead's discussion of Fourth Circuit case law also failed to mention several important points. He acknowledged that the circuit held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10517710685186626889">Wynne v. Town of Great Falls</a> that consistently Christian references are impermissible, but he sought to distinguish the ruling on the ground that council members, rather than outside clergy, presented the prayers at issue in <em>Wynne</em>. He failed to mention, however, that the Fourth Circuit has rejected this very distinction, holding in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9457995272132501336">Simpson v. Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors</a> that prayers presented before legislative bodies constitute governmental speech subject to the strictures of the Establishment Clause, whether they are delivered by outside clergy or by council members. This conclusion, which has been echoed by the other circuits, makes eminent sense: outside clergy, no less than council members, have access to the podium only because the legislative body has set aside time for prayer and has invited the prayer-giver to deliver that prayer. </p>

                <p>Whitehead next stated that the Fourth Circuit's <em>Simpson</em> decision upheld a practice under which "many clerics invoked sectarian terms, including 'Lord God,' 'our creator,' and 'Jesus,' among others." Again, the distortion rests in Whitehead's omission: the explicitly Christian references at issue in <em>Simpson</em> were "occasional or incidental," and the clerics who delivered the prayers reflected a wide variety of religious traditions, including Judaism and Islam. In contrast, in Forsyth County the Christian references were ubiquitous and the post-enactment roster of prayer-givers consisted of exclusively Christian clergy. The <em>Joyner</em> panel was also careful to note, consistently with <em>Simpson</em>, that "[i]nfrequent references to specific deities, standing alone, do not suffice to make out a constitutional case." The <em>Joyner</em> ruling is thus hardly irreconcilable with Supreme Court or Fourth Circuit jurisprudence; indeed, it represents a faithful application of the decisions of both courts. </p>

                <p>Whitehead spends considerable time describing the terms of Forsyth County's "neutral" written policy and emphasizing the policy's application to "religious leaders of all faiths"&#8212;and he claims that the court of appeals "rendered" this neutral policy unconstitutional. In fact, the court declined to strike down Forsyth County's written policy. Rather, the court struck down the county's practice, which, as explained above, involved exclusively Christian clergy delivering explicitly Christian prayers the overwhelming majority of the time. In so doing, the court rightly declined to let formalism carry the day. </p>

                <p>Nor is there merit to Whitehead's criticism that "if <em>Joyner</em> stands, government officials will be forced to review and censor invocation remarks to avoid violations of the First Amendment." Invoking the specter of censorship may cast the decision in an ominous light, but the accusation is grossly out of place in this context. The prayers at issue are not private communications subject to the prohibition on governmental censorship; they are the speech of the government itself&#8212;delivered by government agents, from a government podium, as an official part of a government event. It is not the <em>Joyner</em> decision, but the Establishment Clause itself, which calls for "censorship" in this context. That clause prevents the government from presenting or sponsoring religious messages that prefer some faiths over others, and obligates government&#8212;in all settings, not just at the legislative podium&#8212;to "censor" its remarks to comply with that obligation. Such "censorship" reflects the best of our constitutional traditions. </p>

                <p>Further, as a practical matter, nothing in the panel's decision calls for the parsing of content that Whitehead fears. The <em>Joyner</em> court spoke favorably of a regime, like the one in <em>Simpson</em>, where clergy were simply asked, before their presentation, not to mention specific deities. In contrast, the letter sent to prayer-givers in Forsyth County explicitly instructed that they were free to "offer the invocation according to the dictates of your own conscience." Not surprisingly, in both instances, clergy complied with the terms of the invitation: the clergy in <em>Simpson</em> generally eschewed sectarian references; while those in Forsyth County took full advantage of the license they were given. Surely, Forsyth County's clergy can be trusted to heed a request for ecumenism&#8212;or to decline the invitation. </p>

                <p>As the <em>Joyner</em> panel rightly concluded, "[t]here is a clear line of precedent not only upholding the practice of legislative prayer, but acknowledging the ways in which it can bring together citizens of all backgrounds and encourage them to participate in the workings of their government." However, "while legislative prayer has the capacity to solemnize the weighty task of governance and encourage ecumenism among its participants, it also has the potential to generate sectarian strife. Such conflict rends communities and does violence to the pluralistic and inclusive values that are a defining feature of American public life." Rather than "pos[ing] a danger to the long established tradition of legislative prayer," as Whitehead states, the <em>Joyner</em> decision ensures that this tradition is carried out in a way that does not endanger our Nation's cherished ideals.</p>

A federal judge for the US District Court for the District of Montana <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/montana-judge-allows-congress-to-remove-wolves-from-endangered-species-list.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> of an appropriations rider removing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/ch35.html">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) protection from wolves in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Utah. </p>

                <p>The rider sets a dangerous precedent, marking the first time that Congress&#8212;rather than scientists&#8212;took a plant or animal off the endangered species list. The rider did not actually amend the ESA. Rather, it directed the US Fish and Wildlife Service to reissue the same delisting rule that a federal court already struck down as illegal. That is why we brought a challenge under the separation of powers doctrine.</p>

                <p>While we are disappointed that the judge upheld the constitutionality of the rider, we certainly share his distaste for Congress's actions. Judge Donald Molloy explained that the Endangered Species Act "protects imperiled species, without regard to the popularity of the animal or plant. It does not just protect species when politically convenient. ... [The rider] sacrifices the spirit of the ESA to appease a vocal political faction." He further described the rider as "a tearing away, an undermining, and a disrespect for the fundamental idea of the rule of law."</p>

                <p>Beyond harming the ESA and infringing on the judiciary, the rider leaves wolves without the federal protections they need. Hunting of wolves will soon begin in Idaho and Montana. We hope to stop these hunts and restore Endangered Species Act protections to the wolves <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/environmental-groups-file-emergency-injunction-to-halt-wolf-hunts.php">through an appeal</a> to the Ninth Circuit.</p>

                <p><em>Collette Adkins Giese received her law degree from the University of Minnesota, where she also earned a master's degree in wildlife conservation. Before joining the Center for Biological Diversity, Giese was in private practice, where her pro bono work focused on preservation of endangered species and their habitats.

		<title>Dismantling Migron: The First Step in Meeting International Obligations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jessica Montell, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B'Tselem</a>, argues that the dismantling of an Israeli settlement in the West Bank under a recent court order is a significant step forward for the rule of law, but is only the first step in ending an illegal settlement enterprise...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/jessicamontell.JPG" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>arlier this month, the Supreme Court of Israel <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/israel-supreme-court-orders-watershed-removal-of-west-bank-settlement.php">ordered</a> the state to dismantle Migron, an Israeli settlement outpost in the West Bank. This is a significant judgment for the rule of law in Israel. However, implementation of this ruling would only be one small step in rectifying the wrongs of Israel's settlement enterprise.</p>

                <p>The Migron outpost lies on a hill northeast of Jerusalem. It was founded in 1999 and expanded in 2002. It now houses some 250 people and is the largest of the 100 or so outposts established in the West Bank.</p>

                <p>All Israeli settlements in the West Bank violate the international humanitarian law prohibition on moving the population of an occupying power into occupied territory. The outposts also violate Israeli law; they were built without government approval and without the necessary building permits. In many cases, the land is Palestinian private property. Migron was built on land belonging to Palestinians from the nearby villages of Burqah and Deir Dubwan. This fact is not disputed by Israeli officials. Despite this, the law enforcement authorities&#8212;the Civil Administration, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice&#8212;have never taken any measures to prevent the theft of land and construction in the outpost. In fact, the authorities assisted in building the infrastructure for the outpost.</p>

                <p>The petition to dismantle Migron was filed in June 2006 by the Israeli organization Peace Now. Throughout the years of legal proceedings, the residents continued to build unlawfully&#8212;including construction of public buildings and three permanent structures&#8212;while the law enforcement authorities did nothing substantial to prevent it. Now the court has ruled Migron must be removed within eight months, by the end of March 2012. The last time the court gave an order of this kind was in 1979, when it ordered the state to dismantle the Elon Moreh settlement, which had been built on privately owned Palestinian land. The Elon Moreh settlement was subsequently rebuilt in an adjacent area that was declared "state land," and the government announced that it would no longer requisition private land to build settlements. However, this did not stop settlement construction on Palestinian private property.</p>

                <p>The settlement enterprise severely harms the property rights of individual Palestinians. Settlements also violate collective rights of the Palestinian people to enjoy their natural resources: land, as well as water and other resources. They also have resulted in a dualist and highly discriminatory legal system in the West Bank, where settlers enjoy all the rights and benefits of the Israeli democracy while their Palestinian neighbors live under military occupation.</p>

                <p>Certainly, the Migron outpost must be dismantled and the land returned to its rightful owners. However, given the illegality of the entire settlement enterprise under international law, and the grave infringement of Palestinians' human rights they cause, dismantling Migron is only the first step in bringing Israeli policy in line with its legal obligations.</p>

		<title>Facebook Facial Recognition Violates European Privacy Laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/en/organisation/mitarbeiter/patricia-maria-rogosch">Patricia Rogosch</a>, a research assistant for the EU Project CONSENT <a href="http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/en/">Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law</a>, argues that the Facebook facial recognition feature violates European data protection laws because it was introduced without notifying users and requires users to opt out...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/patriciarogosch.JPG" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>nce again, Facebook <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/germany-authorities-says-facebook-facial-recognition-violates-european-data-protection-law.php">comes under criticism</a>. Once again, the criticism is aimed at the neglect of data protection. After its Friend Finder tool and data leakage, now it is Facebook's facial recognition that catches everybody's attention. While the facial recognition tool was implemented in the US in late 2010, the function was only introduced in Europe in June. </p>

                <p>The software scans users' newly uploaded photos, comparing the faces in the photos with previously labeled photos to see if they match any of the people in the database. Once a match is found, Facebook alerts the person uploading the photos and asks him or her to tag, or identify, the person in the photo. The facial recognition function is problematic for two reasons.</p>

                <p>Firstly, introducing such a function is very questionable, in terms of data protection, to Germany and the EU. Facebook has automatically enabled the feature in users' settings. A user who is not interested in the facial recognition function needs to become active by switching the function off. In addition to that, the feature was introduced without any notification to the users. Johannes Casper, the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, as well as Gerard Lommel, member of the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party that advises the European Commission on privacy issues, rightly criticize possible violations of European data protection law. Users have to be informed about the introduction of a new function before its activation. Furthermore, the non-transparent procedure of opting out as is the case with the facial recognition is not permitted. For consent to be valid, it is not sufficient that the user is just not exercising his or her objection. An unambiguous consent by the affected persons before activation is indispensable. </p>

                <p>Secondly, the facial recognition tool itself is questionable as well. Facebook creates a biometric database that can, due to its large number of members and its enormous amount of uploaded photos, assume unknown proportions. Moreover, it is unclear if the deactivation of the feature actually prevents the whole process or if it is simply not visible to the user anymore. Another question is what Facebook is able to do with such a gigantic biometric database. Uncontrolled dissemination and constantly improving technology may lead to yet unknown risks.</p>

                <p>As a conclusion, it can be said that the facial recognition function as it currently exists in Facebook depicts an incursion into the right of informational self-determination. Users are no longer able to decide who knows what and when about themselves. Facebook itself is taking care of those decisions and for that reason, cancels consent and its function. The lack of transparency and information ahead of the introduction of a new feature leads to the inability of users to control their personal data. </p>

                <p>At least in Europe, data-protection-friendly default settings are inevitable. Facial recognition as well as other functions have to be inactive until the user consciously activates them. Before Facebook changes its terms of service the user needs to be informed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getoar Mjeku, Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law Class of 2014, is a native of Kosovo and a former broadcaster for Voice of America Albanian Service. He writes that the recent conflict with Serbia in Kosovo's northern territory highlights Serbia's role as a persisting roadblock to imposing the rule of law in Kosovo...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/getoarmjeku.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><strong>F</strong>or over a decade, Kosovo has been unable to control its northern territory due to fear of arousing inter-ethnic tensions and for the sake of regional peace and stability. Now, as the country nurtures its aspirations for a European future, the Kosovo government must work to impose rule of law and extend its authority within all Kosovar territory.</p>

<p>Kosovo's government recently came under fire from several actors in the international community, as Prime Minister Hashim Tha&#231;i ordered a police operation to take control of two border checkpoints in the nation's troubled north in July. While focusing on the violence and the tensions that ensued, many international commentators failed to identify the real initiator of the turmoil or acknowledge the new country's commitment to the rule of law and its pro-European orientation. The short-term objective of the police operation was the desire to heighten the effectiveness of Kosovo's customs and border patrol in order to reciprocate Serbia's ban on Kosovar exports, while its long term objective was to extend constitutional order within its territory.</p>

<p>For the sake of peace and stability, and in order to avoid potential violence that could be prompted by Serbian-sponsored organizations, the Kosovo government invested its hopes for law and order in an international police force. Since its 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">Declaration of Independence</a>, Kosovo's government has relied on the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) to help establish order in the Serbian-inhabited north, which, in the absence of formal institutions, has turned into a safe haven for organized crime and contraband.</p>

<p>EULEX's failure to act, however, left Kosovar authorities with no choice but to take matters into their own hands. The Prime Minister's decision to establish control over the border checkpoints was in line with the wishes of the Kosovar government and its international partners, which believe that Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity should remain intact. The executive intended to re-station police and customs officers at the two posts&#8212;which were burnt down by Serbian mobs in 2008&#8212;as part of a peaceful and legitimate action of a sovereign state.</p>

<p>To Kosovo's disadvantage, the swift activation of the Serbian state apparatus laid obstacles in its way. As the Kosovo police special unit moved to the north, neighboring Serbia, which claims Kosovo as its southern province, sent senior government officials into the area in order to mobilize the local ethnic Serb population against the operation. Roadblocks and paramilitary attacks on the Kosovo police resulted in the death of an officer and the injury of several others, and in the wounding of an ethnic Serb reporter. While the special forces withdrew after the two border checkpoints became operational, the local Serb extremists continued their armed demonstration, razing one of the posts for a second time and firing at NATO peacekeepers.</p>

<p>By manipulating the ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo to rise in rebellion against Kosovo's sovereignty and the rule of law, the Serbian government has demonstrated that it will continue its policy of hostility towards its southern neighbor. Unable to maintain or retake Kosovo by force, Serbia hopes to make the new country dysfunctional and to perhaps regain control of northern Kosovo.</p>

<p>In the short term, Serbia may wish to export its products to Kosovo, and non-functioning border checkpoints would allow them to bypass the reciprocal trade ban. However, in the long run, Serbia likely hopes to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/serbia-president-refuses-to-rule-out.php">partition</a> Kosovo and to continue to destabilize the young republic, as it has done for years. As long as organized crime flourishes in the Kosovo's north and the area remains out of government control, Serbia has the ability to play the situation to its advantage, arguing against Kosovo's independence and state-building capacities.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kosovo's territory and borders are well defined&#8212;Serbia has no formal objections to the boundary lines&#8212;and it is the duty of the Kosovar government to control them. For years, however, Kosovo's government has tried to avoid Serb-instigated violence in the north and has tolerated criminal organizations in the area. The very peace and stability that Kosovo yearns to maintain will be unsustainable without order and effective rule of law. </p>

<p>The country should be commended for its commitment to its democratic constitution and it should be assisted in exercising sovereignty over this undisputed territory. Kosovo can maintain the hope for further European integration only as an indivisible, sovereign, multiethnic and democratic state. Whereas Serbia, the main hurdle to Kosovo's territorial integrity, will not accede to the continental bloc before it has normalized relations with its neighbors.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/faculty/faculty-profiles/laurie-blank.html">Laurie Blank</a> of Emory University School of Law argues that the recent claim of zero civilian casualties from US drone strikes in Pakistan may sound good at first, but indicates more concerning possibilities in US interpretation and adherence to the laws of war...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/laurieblank.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast week, top US intelligence officials announced that US drone strikes in Pakistan had caused zero civilian casualties in the past year. The US has launched well over a hundred drone strikes against al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Pakistan since January 2010, and has killed hundreds of militants over the past few years.</p>

<p>The drone strikes are the source of heated debates regarding the numbers killed&#8212;both militants and innocent civilians. They also raise a number of interesting questions of international law, strategy and policy. Calls are made repeatedly both in the US and abroad for greater transparency regarding the nature of the targets, the process by which targets are identified and approved and the legal parameters of the program overall.</p>

<p>The CIA's claim of zero casualties now suggests we are not even at the point of healthy debate about the law, strategy and effects on the ground. Drone strikes against hard to identify militants operating and seeking shelter in and among civilians&#8212;even with the extraordinary surveillance capabilities and precision-guided weapons being used&#8212;simply cannot leave the civilian population entirely unscathed. </p>

<p>If the US government is saying that not a single innocent civilian has been killed, then there must be a great deal more unknown to the public about the drone strikes. This raises some serious problems. Two fundamental legal principles guide drone strikes: attacks must be directed only at legitimate targets and any anticipated civilian casualties must not be excessive in relation to the anticipated military gain from the attack.</p>

<p>Who is being targeted and how are the determinations being made? International and domestic law requires that any attack distinguish between legitimate targets and innocent civilians. There is no doubt that the intelligence gathering and long-term surveillance capabilities of drones offer heightened opportunities to fulfill these obligations. Drones can loiter over a target for hours, even days, allowing operators and decision-makers to determine if he or she is indeed the person they are seeking and is engaged in hostile activity.  </p>

<p>Even these high-tech systems are not perfect, however. Missiles can go astray, children can be hard to spot or be hiding in the target building unbeknownst to the drone operators&#8212;any number of errors or unexpected developments can lead to unanticipated civilian casualties. That is an unfortunate and tragic aspect of combat.  </p>

<p>In these circumstances, the claim of zero casualties suggests two potential scenarios, both of which are highly troubling. First, the CIA's definition of who constitutes a legitimate target could be significantly broader, leading to fewer casualties considered to be "innocent." Thankfully, there is currently no evidence to support this disturbing suggestion. Second, the CIA's process for identifying and determining who is a legitimate target may not be based on sufficiently precise and demanding criteria. If so, calls for greater transparency regarding the decision-making process (not with an eye to revealing protected source information, but just regarding who we are targeting and why) are essential.  </p>

<p>Second, the claim of zero casualties also suggests that the linkage between strategy and law is becoming unhinged. Counterinsurgency strategy and mission imperatives appropriately seek to eliminate civilian casualties as much as possible in the fight for "hearts and minds."  However, international law does not require no civilian casualties&#8212;indeed, the law accepts that there will be incidental casualties from lawful attacks, a tragic but not criminal consequence of war. The combination of the unmanned aerial vehicle's highly precise targeting capabilities and strategic needs to reduce civilian casualties has led to a growing&#8212;and mistaken&#8212;perception that any civilian deaths are unlawful. The claim of zero casualties, along with the implied affirmation of such a standard, threatens to further cement this faulty approach.  </p>

<p>It may seem that innocent civilians will be the beneficiaries of this development&#8212;in fact, the opposite is true. A military force facing such a zero casualty standard will either disregard the law entirely as unreasonable, endangering civilians in the combat zone, or will refrain from military operations altogether to avoid legal violations, leaving its own citizens undefended from attacks. Both options leave innocent civilians unprotected and in danger.</p>

<p>Zero casualties may sound good, but it is not nearly as good as it sounds. In fact, it tells us that we know a lot less than we thought about the drone strikes and that the process demands significantly greater attention than the results might indicate. </p>

This indicates a kill or capture confrontation in the very near future if or when Muammar Gaddafi is found. </p>

<p>The die appears to be cast, inasmuch as representatives from the International Criminal Court (ICC) were reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">meeting with Libyan rebels</a> to discuss turning over Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi to the court for prosecution for war crimes, despite conflicting reports on whether rebel leaders allowed Saif al-Islam and another of Gaddafi's seven sons to escape after arresting them. As an additional motivation to bring the erstwhile "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution" out of hiding, Libyan rebels are purportedly offering a $1.7 million reward and amnesty for any regime loyalist who delivers Gaddafi to them, dead or alive.</p>

<p>The world has seen this scenario played out in months prior with leaders elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East, particularly those of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egypt</a>. In the former instance, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, as a deposed dictator and an internationally infamous subject, gained exile in Saudi Arabia. The latter, Hosni Mubarak, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-prosecutor-mubarak-to-stand-trial-could-face-death-penalty.php">detained</a> by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to be brought to justice.</p>

<p>There are tremendously compelling reasons for bringing the Gaddafis and their hierarchy to justice for crimes against humanity; the mass murder of civilians, forced mass expulsion of foreign residents, and the unlawful detention and torture of hundreds. They must not be granted amnesty and comfortable exile in some foreign nation, as in the wake of the Tunisian "Jasmine Revolution."  </p>

<p>A paradigm from seven years past is the siege of Baghdad, which eroded Saddam Hussein's grip on authority. Biding his time, the president and prime minister of the fallen government chose to hide in a "spider hole" in the ground. He was found shortly thereafter and <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/saddam-executed-iraqi-tv.php">tried and hanged</a> in December 2006.</p>

<p>The Gaddafis, and their key co-conspirators, should be handled in a manner consistent with the trend emergent over the past decade; the refusal of subsequent governments to grant amnesty for the former dictator's acts of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. While lacking a certain expediency in removing a dictator from control, this protocol reinforces state practices and international custom promoting accountability and respect for the rule of law.</p>

<p>A show trial, as in Iraq or Egypt, may rely on both domestic and international notions of crimes under <em>jus cogens</em>, or peremptory norms in international law. However, such a forum, or even the ICC, will face a challenge arising from the fact that no international convention exists specifically regarding crimes against humanity. Moreover, as for the other international crimes considered here, there is little evidence of a general, uniform and consistent practice by states supporting the existence of a customary obligation to prosecute crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>If the Gaddafis, and others, are brought to justice at the ICC, rather than in Libya or in some <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/lebanon-court-issues-warrants-for.php">other country</a>, the court has already predetermined that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">not grant immunity</a> to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya. The inclusion of crimes against humanity in the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> of the ICC clearly indicates the existence of a broad consensus among most states that perpetrators of such crimes must face criminal prosecution. </p>

<p>Luis Moreno-Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor of the ICC, has already <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">obtained arrest warrants</a> for Muammar Gaddafi and two others in his inner circle on charges of crimes against humanity. Ocampo said his office has <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-has-evidence-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-prosecutor.php">gathered evidence</a> that Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi, plotted together to orchestrate attacks on civilians. He said al-Islam was acting as a "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya.</p>

<p>Prosecutors may seek to act under the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/x5picoda.htm">Principles of International Co-operation in the Detention, Arrest, Extradition and Punishment of Persons Guilty of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity</a>, establishing a specific duty on states to "assist each other in detecting, arresting, and bringing to trial persons suspected of having committed such crimes." Alternatively, they may well interpret and implement the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/executions.htm">Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions</a>, endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 1989; as well as Article 14 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/h4dpaped.htm">Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance</a>, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1992.</p>

<p>Calling for an international inquiry into Libyan violence and justice for victims in February 2011, Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-action-to-halt-libya-violence.php">said</a>:<blockquote>The state has an obligation to protect the rights to life, liberty and security. ... Protection of civilians should always be the paramount consideration in maintaining order and the rule of law. The authorities should immediately cease such illegal acts of violence against demonstrators. Widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population may amount to crimes against humanity.</blockquote>The time has come to assist the nascent, <em>de facto</em> National Transitional Council leadership of Libya to promote the protection of civilians and to bring the worst offenders of the Gaddafi regime to fully constituted process of justice, and not summary execution or the perpetual summertime of exile.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lauren Prunty, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2012, is the author of the third article in a ten part <a href="/forum/2011/09/leonard-baynes-series-introduction.php">series</a> from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a> under the direction of Professor Leonard Baynes. She writes on federal anti-terrorism law and the benefits of prosecuting domestic terrorists for treason...<hr height='1'><strong>I</strong>n August 2010, Hawo Mohamed Hassan, a 63-year-old woman from Minnesota, was arrested and charged along with 13 other members of the Somali community for providing material support to a terrorist organization. Hassan went door-to-door collecting charitable donations of food, medical supplies and other necessities in an effort to bring humanitarian aid to the people of war-torn Somalia. Nonetheless, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted Hassan and the others on charges of channeling funds and supplying fighters to the militant Somali group al-Shabab. In other words, for providing "material support" to terrorists. While Hassan has maintained that she did not know the funds were being channeled to al-Shabab, this is of little importance to the DOJ, as acts of terrorism can be unintentional under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.03162:">Patriot Act</a>, signed into law by President George W. Bush.</p>

<p>Under current anti-terrorism statutes, "material support" is broadly defined. It does not require that the actor either intend to or know they are funding terrorism. This means that a person like Hassan can be found to materially support terrorism without ever knowing she did so. Hassan has declared her innocence. However, she has also admitted to raising the funds and, unfortunately, there is no distinction in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p>In October 2011, Hassan will face trial in a federal court on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to a terrorist organization. If she is convicted, she may face a life sentence. However, under the proposed <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.3327:">Terrorist Expatriation Act</a>, she could instead be subjected to an arguably more grave possibility; the recision of her US citizenship&#8212;a punishment far worse than prison, without a trial or due process protections that are mandated by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a>.  </p>

<p>In May 2010, Senators Joe Lieberman and Scott Brown <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-strip-terror-suspects-of-citizenship-rights.php">proposed</a> an addition to the current expatriation statute, making the provision of material support of resources to a foreign terrorist organization an action for which a US citizen may lose his or her citizenship. The proposed amendment relies on the same broad definition of material support found in the anti-terrorism statutes. The bill seeks to bring existing federal law concerning expatriation up-to-date by including provisions applicable to the current War on Terror, such as allowing the State Department to revoke the citizenship of people suspected of allying themselves with terrorist organizations. As Senator Lieberman stated, the current War on Terror involves "fighting an enemy who doesn't wear the uniform of a conventional army or follow the law of war."</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that today's War on Terror falls outside the lines of traditional warfare, and perhaps we need to look at today's enemies in a new light. However, it is also important to remember that today's enemies may often be US citizens, fighting against our country from within. For example, Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square Bomber, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nyc-car-bomb-suspect-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">planned and attempted to commit acts of war</a> against his own country. Nonetheless, as a US citizen he was afforded the rights and protections guaranteed by the Constitution. However deplorable and reprehensible the actions of domestic terrorists may be, they are still US citizens and their constitutional rights must be honored. Otherwise, the rights and privileges of US citizenship ultimately become meaningless. Legislation that seeks to revoke an individual's citizenship before a criminal conviction, or before they are afforded a trial and due process, is quite simply unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Despite the changing nature of today's warfare, a domestic enemy is anything but new. Concerns regarding treason, the only crime listed in the Constitution, date back to the days of Benedict Arnold and the Founding Fathers themselves. The Constitution defines treason as an act of "levying war against the United States."  Historically, during times of conventional war, an individual aiding the enemy by providing information, support or other resources would be subject to prosecution for treason. However, in the twenty-first century, questions of war and treason in the US do not involve conventional enemies. Rather, treason today takes the form of Faisal Shahzad or Farooque Ahmed, who attempted to bomb the DC Metro, and other domestic terrorists, whose actions are tantamount to waging war against the US.</p>

<p>If we recognize domestic terrorism as the modern day incarnation of treason, the proposed Terrorist Expatriation Act is both redundant and unnecessary. In addition to being constitutionally invalid, the proposed subsection merely reiterates federal expatriation law that has been in place since the 1940s, and under which an individual may be stripped of their citizenship following a trial and conviction for the charge of treason. In looking at the future of both domestic and foreign policy, the US must recognize that modern day terrorists who attack their homeland are in fact committing treason. Today's world no longer involves Benedict Arnold or Russian double agents, rather treason today has taken on the form of domestic terrorism and individuals that levy war against the US and advocate for the overthrow of the nation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christie Tomm, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2012, is the author of the second article in a ten part <a href="/forum/2011/09/leonard-baynes-series-introduction.php">series</a> from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development </a>under the direction of Professor Leonard Baynes. She writes on the need to maintain a single justice system in prosecuting alleged foreign terrorists...<hr height='1'><strong>A</strong>fter a decade of uncertainty, the Obama administration recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">announced</a> that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would be tried in a military tribunal, as opposed to federal court. Until the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama Bin Laden</a>, Mohammed was the person most directly involved in the 9/11 attacks apprehended by US authorities. As such, his prosecution would function as a symbol of much-awaited justice for those Americans whose lives were devastated by the horrific events of that day. However, in deciding to try Mohammed in a military tribunal, that justice will be muted and its significance undermined.</p>

<p>The US government set a dangerous precedent when it passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.3930:">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA). In doing so, it gave another governing body, one that is not required to adhere to the fundamental rights outlined in the Constitution, jurisdiction to determine the guilt or innocence of non-citizens suspected of terror-related crimes. For the Constitution to continue to serve as a fundamental governing principle nationally and internationally, its validity and dominance in the federal criminal justice system should never be questioned. To ensure this, when a person, citizen or non-citizen, is charged with any crime, from petty larceny to tax evasion or terrorism, there can be only one set of rules that govern what rights the defendant is entitled to. </p>

<p>The MCA is contrary to the principles established by the US during more than 200 years of common law. The MCA allows military tribunals to admit into evidence confessions that do not respect an individual's <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6386252699535531764">Miranda</a> or Fifth Amendment rights, and the MCA does not require that a terror suspect be given a trial to determine his guilt once he is deemed an enemy combatant, essentially allowing for his indefinite detention. However, despite the fact that the federal criminal justice system does provide these fundamental rights, it is more than adequately able to handle the trials of suspected terrorists. The executive branch, through its specially trained district attorneys, FBI agents and terrorist task forces, is prepared to deal with the particular challenges that come with investigating and trying a suspect that is not a US citizen, likely to be uncooperative and to evoke controversy and intense emotion in the public forum.</p>

<p>The federal criminal justice system also has procedural benefits, such as well-established sentencing guidelines with longer minimum sentences for terrorism-related crimes and the district attorneys have more power to negotiate plea deals. Furthermore, there is a greater likelihood that other nations will investigate intelligence gathered from suspected terrorists when they are being tried in a more trusted federal court system. Additionally, federal courts also have the benefit of the public-safety exception recognized by the US Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13717772316457971707">Quarles v. New York</a>, which resolved Congress's concern that the Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate was an unmanageable burden on the prosecution of suspected terrorists. Under the public-safety exception, when the police are aware of a danger to the public that needs to be resolved immediately, they can ask suspects about the risk without Mirandizing them, and the statements will still be admissible at trial. Faisal Shahzad, the "Times Square Bomber," was interrogated under the public-safety exception, ultimately pleading guilty to the attempted bombing and then sentenced to life in prison.</p>

<p>In spite of these facts, Congress turned away from the federal criminal justice system and invoked the rules of war, which have not been considered since World War II, to create an alternate justice system and rules of criminal procedure. However, in doing so, Congress has opened the floodgates. This approach was never necessary to begin with in light of the adequacy of the federal criminal justice system. Furthermore, going forward there are grave concerns regarding the impossibility of limiting the MCA's use only to suspected terrorists that are foreign aliens. If the US is going to demand high human rights standards of other nations, it must meet them itself. The only way to do this is to exclusively use the federal criminal justice system in order to convey the confidence that the US can, and will, provide justice to those wronged while guaranteeing certain fundamental rights to defendants that are still presumed innocent. In no instance would such a statement have been more significant than in Khalid Sheik Mohammed's case.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Judd Baroff, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2012, is the author of the first article in a ten part <a href="/forum/2011/09/leonard-baynes-series-introduction.php">series</a> from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a> under the direction of Professor Leonard Baynes. Baroff writes on reforming US education policy through the introduction of high school exit examinations...<hr height='1'><strong>A</strong>s has become a morbid joke in the US, we are an ignorant country, and our high schools are particularly deplorable. In 2001, 57 percent of American high school seniors scored "below basic" on an exam of simple historical knowledge, while only 1 percent scored "advanced." For example, 52 percent chose Italy, Germany or Japan over the Soviet Union as a US ally in World War II. They were similarly ignorant with respect to the content of the Constitution. For example, even though their parents underwent foreign and domestic turmoil to guarantee their freedom of expression, only 25 percent of contemporary college students could name a single right granted by the First Amendment. Furthermore, in a world that increasingly demands mathematical and scientific knowledge, children in the US tested far below average. In 2005, 46 percent of students could not reach a "basic" understanding of mathematics, while only 2 percent were deemed "advanced." Furthermore, these statistics were verified on an international level; of 57 countries sampled, the US ranked 32, behind such booming economies as Lithuania and New Zealand. Only 42 percent of Americans accept the validity of evolution, and 20 percent believe in witches. In the field of education, the only thing that makes Americans exceptional is their ignorance. There are many differences between the nations that outperformed the US and the US itself, but one significant common denominator seemed to be that most high-performing countries have a high school exit examination. Accordingly, the US might do well to adopt this policy in order to improve its educational system.</p>

<p>In March 2010, President Barack Obama attempted to solve the problem by reauthorizing <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:H.R.1:">No Child Left Behind</a> (NCLB), altering the original legislation substantially. His predecessor, George W. Bush, originally signed the act into law on January 8, 2002. Its purpose was "to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain high-quality education" and to create "accountability systems" against which teachers and administrators could be judged. This past year, President Obama recognized that by almost any measure, the act had failed. Specifically, he attacked NCLB's system of "accountability," which wreaked havoc on schools by depriving the most desperate schools of sorely needed money. Unfortunately, he did not focus on two even greater concerns. Even though the number of "proficient students" had increased, the objective quality of American education sank; and the vague standards of NCLB had encouraged every state to dumb down its definition of proficiency to meet the quota that the act required.</p>

<p>Now, it is important to remember that NCLB is not a national exit examination. It demands a certain proficiency in fourth and eighth grade, but that proficiency is determined by the individual states and they can accommodate the federal "standards" by dumbing down the examination. A national exit examination would be a single examination that every person in the US would have to pass before graduating, whereas NCLB is a complex series of regulations that demand consistent communication between federal and local governments, constant new investment by states, and constant pain and interruption to students and teachers. If there were a national high school exit examination, the costs on all levels could be depressed by creating one examination (this examination must be spread over several days to be effective). Having one examination that does not change from state to state would mean less oversight from the federal government, thus lowering costs. Further, one examination would create one standard, the preparation of which would itself lower costs. If this examination was curriculum based, there would be no further interruptions into teaching&#8212;"teaching to the test" would become simply teaching the material necessary. Finally, exit examinations have been shown to improve the performance of those who take them as compared to those who do not.</p>

<p>Although no study of domestic cases to date has examined why students who meet external exit examinations do better than those who do not, two foreign studies offered sundry hypotheses. Researchers in a German <a href="https://www.cesifo-group.de/pls/guestci/download/CESifo%20Working%20Papers%202003/CESifo%20Working%20Papers%20May%202003/cesifo_wp939.pdf">study</a> [PDF] suggested that a uniform, centralized standard was clearer and more accurate, while decentralized examinations allowed administrators and parents to inflate observed educational achievement by deflating standards. Meanwhile, a Canadian study suggests that the externality of the centralized standards clearly show students how they compare to their peers throughout the whole province (or country in this instance), as opposed to simply within an individual school; this makes the examination more meaningful. Therefore, students that learn under centralized standards are more likely to take their work seriously, improve themselves and believe education is important. Finally, centralized exit examinations demand greater levels of knowledge from the students. This allows for greater distinction than a simple pass/fail minimum skills examination, which, in turn, encourages the more intellectually gifted students to work, where a minimum skills examination would encourage them in lethargy.<br />
 <br />
Our nation cannot alter its dispassion for education by congressional order. Still, it can learn from Germany and its Canadian cousins, and focus on how to improve its schools. An externally created, centralized high school exit examination has been shown to improve the performance of students. It will also decrease money now spent on individual states administering multiple examinations and spent by students acquiring higher degrees in an attempt to make up for the failure of our current high school system. The freed money, and the freed time that will come with it, could then be reinvested in creating the type of nation that will "out perform" everyone else in the twenty-first century.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/faculty/Profiles/Baynes">Leonard Baynes</a> of St. John's University School of Law says that in order for a lawyer to be an effective advocate for their client and for social justice, they must advocate to the public as well as the courts. He demonstrates this by introducing a series of articles written by his students which will run on JURIST over the next several weeks...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/leonardbaynes.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>C</strong></font>harles Hamilton Houston, a former dean of Howard University School of Law, one of the grand architects of the legal strategy behind the Civil Rights Movement, and a teacher of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, once declared that "a lawyer is either a social engineer or a parasite." Houston meant that a lawyer could either comfortably earn a living by sometimes profiting from a client's troubles, or a lawyer could use his or her law degree to change the world for the better. At St. John's University School of Law, through a course called Perspectives on Justice offered exclusively to the second-year staff of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a>, we are educating students to use legal scholarship to change the world. Over the coming weeks, JURIST will be publishing several of the journal staffers' opinion pieces in a ten part series. In these articles, you will see that the students are strong advocates for interpreting the law to further social justice.</p>

<p>To change the world, a lawyer has to effectively advocate for her client. It does not matter whether the lawyer is a litigator or transactional lawyer. A lawyer needs to be committed to the issues that she represents, and this commitment will help the lawyer to find her inner voice and passion.</p>

<p>Lawyers are most effective when they can break an issue down into clear-cut issues of right and wrong, and they sometimes need to rally public opinion to see this perspective. We have seen this most recently with the actions of Kenneth Thompson, the lawyer representing the hotel housekeeper Nafissatou Diallo, who accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, of sexual assault and attempted rape. Certain issues about Diallo's background surfaced, causing prosecutors to question her veracity. As a consequence, Thompson took to the airwaves defending and advocating for his client. In an unprecedented move, he has disclosed his client's identity to the media and made her available to media query. Thompson <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/media-savvy-lawyer-maid-strauss-kahn-case-154821826.htm">described</a> Diallo's situation in stark terms of injustice: "Ms. Diallo now brings this lawsuit to vindicate her rights, to assert her dignity as a woman ... and to stand up for all women who have been raped, sexually assaulted and/or abused throughout the world but who are too afraid to speak out."</p>

<p>Although Thompson's media advocacy has not stopped New York prosecutors from dropping Diallo's case, he still maintains his client's right to justice. He has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/nyregion/charges-against-strauss-kahn-dismissed.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&sq=dominique strauss kahn&st=cse&scp=2">declared</a> that the New York prosecutor "has abandoned an innocent woman and has denied an innocent woman a right to get justice in a rape case ... and by doing so, he has also abandoned other women who will be raped in the future or sexually assaulted." Thompson's continued advocacy has managed to paint a competing and more sympathetic image of his client that will be useful for the upcoming civil lawsuit based on the same allegations. In addition, Thompson's advocacy has had two other salient effects. First, it persuaded another alleged victim in France to come forward charging Strauss-Kahn with similar conduct; and, second, it has changed the conversation in France about the morality of behaviors like those alleged.<br />
 <br />
Like Thompson, lawyers have had a long tradition of using the media for the purposes of influencing an individual case or advocating for larger social justice issues contained within it. Through op-eds, opinion pieces that appear opposite the editorial page in newspapers, lawyers are able to reach and affect a wider audience. Op-eds draw the readers' attention to an important issue in need of a solution and provide the author's perspective on the problem and his or her solution to it. Charles Hamilton Houston <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/1287.html">wrote over 100 op-eds</a> during his twenty-five year legal career. Many were published during pending litigation; most were in African American newspapers as well as in the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Similarly, other lawyers who are social justice activists have written op-eds to influence public opinion and illustrate the significance of the issues they are litigating. For instance, Anthony Romero, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Terry Pell, the President of the Center for Individual Rights, co-authored an op-ed that appeared in the <em>Wisconsin State Journal</em>, which discussed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10117776825257150184">Morse v. Frederick</a> case where a student displayed a banner stating "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" during the Olympic Torch Relay in Alaska. The student was suspended and then sued the school district arguing that his First Amendment rights were violated. The co-authors are particularly noteworthy because they come to the issue from opposing ideological perspectives, but they were both of the opinion that the ban on speech and subsequent suspension violated the First Amendment. They stated: "The First Amendment is central to the American spirit. It is part of what makes us who we are as a people." As President of the National Organization of Women, Kim Gandy wrote a number of op-eds. In <em>USA Today</em> in 2007, she wrote an op-ed entitled "End the Discrimination," where she powerfully advocated for the full enforcement of Title IX to end the gender stereotypes that women were not suited for the study of math and science. Each of these advocates recognized the power of informing the general public about these complex legal issues. Although judges do not decide legal cases based on popular opinion, they are conscious of how their decisions may play out in the larger context. In making a decision on a controversial subject, a judge often wants to make sure that his or her decision is not too far outside the mainstream, that it is not overturned by legislation, and that it is ultimately enforceable. Although judges may not be unduly influenced by public opinion, legislatures, administrative agencies and prosecutors are ultimately beholden to the people. In these circumstances, that is where informing and rallying the public to a cause is likely to have the most currency.</p>

<p>At St. John's University School of Law, we designed a special one-year, three-credit course called Perspectives on Justice specifically for the second year staff of the Journal. As part of the course, the students learn about critical theory and significant legal issues of racial, social, and economic justice by principally reading assignments from Emma Coleman Jordan's and Angela Harris's course book, "Economic Justices: Race, Gender, Identity and Economics" and from other sources. We assign these readings to ensure that the students are grounded in current theory and law about these complex social issues. We encourage students to use the readings as a "jumping off" point for their research and writing. </p>

<p>The course is co-taught by three faculty members, with the assistance of three notes and comments editors, who work with the students to identify the legal and social justice issues present in cases of first impression. Under the supervision of a faculty member, each student is required to write a twenty-three page research paper, a five-page blog, and a 1,000-word opinion piece focusing on issues of racial, social, and economic justice. We require these three forms of writing for quite traditional reasons. We want the students to have experience in taking a research and writing project and turning it into three different versions for three different audiences. In practice, this is the kind of experience that is often de rigueur for young lawyers, i.e., writing three different memoranda, one for the supervising attorney, another for the judge, and yet another for the client. Given the topics, our wrinkle of the practical aspect of writing gives students an opportunity to advocate passionately in a short opinion piece to a mainstream audience by calling attention to a socially significant legal problem or issue.</p>

<p>The staff members of the Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development wrote the opinion pieces in this series while they were second year law students. They have written on a wide range of topics involving issues as diverse as  the intersection of criminal justice and national security, the legality of a patient's choosing health care providers by race, the viability of national high school exit exams, and the Federal Communications Commission's regulation of unexpected cell phone charges, just to name a few. We are very proud of their accomplishments and encourage you to read their articles in the series and enjoy them.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> of Webster University and Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, says that the right to participate in government is a recognized aspiration in international law and that in the Middle East this has begun to be realized with the Arab Spring...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forumy/curtisdoebbler.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecent events in the Middle East have raised and continue to raise important questions about individuals' and peoples' rights to participate in their own government. Although some controversy remains about what this right entails, there is widespread consensus on the existence of a core right of all people to participate in their own government.</p>

<p>One of the best forums for reviewing this consensus is international law, which provides a widely shared understanding of human and peoples' rights as well as the limits within such rights exist. Recent events in the Middle East can be evaluated on the basis of this international law, which arguably offers a much more widely appreciated indication of the international community's expectations than mere political or particular religious claims. International law contains numerous expressions of individuals' and peoples' rights to participate in their own government. These statements range from aspirational declarations to legally binding treaties. Together they provide a reliable understanding of individuals' and peoples' rights to participate in their own government.</p>

<p>An appropriate starting place for understanding individuals' and peoples' rights to participate in their own government is the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. This instrument reflects the aspirational consensus of the international community. It declares in Article 21 that the "will of the people shall be the basis of government." This widely endorsed, but non-legally binding, expression of human rights also states in Article 21 that "[e]veryone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives." </p>

<p>Similarly, the aspirational <a href="http://www.al-bab.com/arab/docs/international/hr1981.htm">Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights</a> states in Article 11 that the "[p]rocess of free consultation (<em>Shura</em>) is the basis of the administrative relationship between the government and the people. People also have the right to choose and remove their rulers in accordance with this principle."</p>

<p>This is not surprising as the right of citizens to participate in the affairs of their state is also a basic tenant of Islam. According to the Qur'an, governments are merely <a href="http://quran.com/24/55">temporal holders of Allah's trust of human life on earth</a>, and government must be <a href="http://quran.com/42/38">conducted in consultation with the governed</a>. This right to participate in one's own government is not developed, but it was clearly recognized hundreds of years before it was recognized in most Western societies.</p>

<p>States have also affirmed individuals' and peoples' rights to participate in their own government in legally binding human rights treaties. The right of all citizens to participate in their own government has been expressly agreed to by about two-thirds of the international community in Article 25 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR).</p>

<p>Regionally, numerous legally binding instruments affirm the right of citizens to participate in their government. Article 24 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/arabhrcharter.html">Arab Charter of Human Rights</a> states that every citizen has the right "[t]o take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives." Article 13, paragraph 1 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z1afchar.htm">African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights</a> provides for the right of every citizen to "participate freely in the government of his country." Article 23 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/oasinstr/zoas3con.htm">American Convention on Human Rights</a> recognizes the right of every citizen "to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives." Although European countries saw fit to include an express limitation of aliens' political rights in the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/z17euroco.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR), Article 3 of the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/euro/z20prot1.html">First Protocol</a> belatedly states that "[t]he High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature." </p>

<p>The non-binding <a href="http://www.asean.org/21069.pdf">Charter of the Association of Asian and South East Nations</a> [PDF] repeats a commitment to democracy several times, but contains no explicit reference to the right of citizens to participate in their government.</p>

<p>There are some common elements that run through each of these expressions of the right to participate in one's government. First, this right applies to every citizen, but this is a limited principle of non-discrimination. States may, for example, discriminate against non-citizens and minors as both of these may be excluded from participation in government.</p>

<p>Second, the right to participate is not related to any particular form of government. It may be exercised by a system of government where members of a parliament are chosen to represent the people or by a government where widespread consultations take place so that individuals are able to influence their government. Thus, forms of government are as diverse as the Western form of parliamentary democracy and the Islamic tradition of <em>Shura</em> consultations.</p>

<p>Third, bodies or institutions that are strongly Western-influenced have focused on voting as an element of the exercise of democracy. For example, the General Comment of the Human Rights Committee on Article 25 of the ICCPR and the ECHR focus on this element of democracy. Other instruments, such as the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights and the Arab Charter of Human Rights, are more nuanced. These instruments merely speak about consultation or participation through one's chosen representatives.</p>

<p>Fourth, the right to participate in one's government does not sanction violent acts even if they are politically motivated. Although the prohibition against violence is not expressly stated, it is likely customary international law that flows from the very nature of the Westphalian state which is founded on ensuring peace and security. It also flows from the duty of every state to protect all persons under their jurisdiction from attacks on their security and from inhumane treatment.</p>

<p>Fifth, the right to participate in one's government must be exercised consistently with the right to self-determination. An essential part of the right to self-determination is that the people of a country must decide for themselves the form of government and policies they want. Outside interference with this decision violates the right to self-determination.</p>

<p>In <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a>, the effort to acquire a greater right to participate was exercised almost exclusively by the citizens of the country concerned. The citizens of these countries rose up to take matters into their own hands while explicitly warning foreign elements not to exploit the situation for their private gain. In Bahrain, it was the government, rather than the protesters, that appealed to foreign governments for help using US-advised Saudi troops to violently squelch peaceful demonstrations. In Yemen, there have been widespread allegations that foreign fighters have been involved in the violence against the government. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a> is perhaps the clearest example of foreign interference. Allegations that the uprising was foreign-led were substantiated when NATO intervened, alleging to be acting on the basis of UN authorization. In fact, the <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">UN authorization said nothing about regime change</a> and proxy occupation, which quickly became central NATO goals. Moreover, while less than 5,000 Libyans had been killed by the civil strife prior to NATO's intervention; estimates of deaths after the intervention have risen to as high as 100,000. </p>

<p>The forms of government supported in the various countries are still very far from clear. Groups joining the uprisings in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> and Libya have voiced clear preferences for Islamic-based caliphates. Western influenced groups in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya have called for Western-style capitalist democracies whereby foreigners could own as much or more of the country's resources as could the countries' citizens. Islamic groups, such as Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, have called for mixed forms of government combining Islamic values with forms of government that are more prevalent in the West. There seems to be a consensus that greater participation rights should be granted to all citizens, and voting rights are usually mentioned in conjunction. Other forms of consultation, however, are also being discussed in Libya and Yemen.</p>

<p>In Egypt, one of the most outstanding features of the demonstrations was their predominately peaceful character. Even when violence was used against protesters they refused to respond with violence. Similarly in Tunisia, the government fell with minimal violence leaving many institutions and people in place.</p>

<p>In Libya, the NATO-led rebels, in what appears to be a well-planned action, almost immediately took heavy weapons under their control and began using significant violence against the government. The Libyan government responded with a heavy use of force by security officers. However, the Libyan government did not call in its army until the situation had deteriorated to the level of a country-wide civil war. Similarly in Yemen, the situation quickly deteriorated into violence on both the government's and the protesters' side. This violence seemed to revive memories of the 1994 civil war and was perhaps responsible for the subsequent ebb in violence. In recent months, with the Yemeni president abroad for medical care after being wounded, the violence appears to have subsided.</p>

<p>In Bahrain, with apparent Western backing, the government effectively used a foreign military, along with its own, to shut down peaceful demonstrators with intensive violence. Ironically, while NATO was bombing Libya it was discouraging violence in Bahrain, but turned a blind eye when it took place with increasingly widespread and stronger intensity.</p>

<p>Finally, a common feature in each case was the claim by those seeking participation that they were exercising their right to self-determination. While usually made in political terms, under international law, the claim seems spurious in cases where violence was used against a government. Again, Libya provides perhaps the most striking example of self-determination being used in a manner that is inconsistent with international law. The reason for this is that Libya was a prosperous country, the richest in Africa, and was on track to achieve all the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a>. Only these two facts indicate that the government in Libya was providing its people with basic social and economic human rights. Criticism was leveled at the Libyan government's civil and political rights record, but such criticism has also been leveled against the US and UK, who have regularly spied on their own citizens. </p>

<p>While it was legitimate for the Libyans opposed to the government to expect that their concerns about civil and political rights be addressed, international law does not allow people to use force to achieve these rights, at least not without exhausting all other means. In fact, the prohibition on the use of force in the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/aunchart.htm">UN Charter</a>, as well as the requirement that states resolve their disputes peacefully, indicate that international law has little tolerance for violence. </p>

<p>The use of force to achieve self-determination is restricted by international law. Only national liberation movements fighting against a foreign and oppressive occupation are entitled to achieve their aims utilizing violence. Although the NATO-led rebels claim to be such a movement, they are not widely recognized as such, nor have they made an effort to exhaust non-violent means of achieving their civil and political rights. The fact that Libyans' economic and social rights have been respected more by the government than the NATO-led rebels, who are selling the nation's resources to pay for the military assistance of foreign powers, makes it difficult for them to substantiate their claim to be fighting for national liberation. Instead, they appear to be championing the agenda of countries interested in Libya's resources. </p>

<p>In Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain, the peaceful demonstrators, while still falling short of recognition as a national liberation movement, have articulated their case in terms that are much more conducive to such recognition. In both Egypt and Tunisia, the point may be moot as the people have achieved some of the changes for which they were calling, particularly the departure of the previous government. In Bahrain and Yemen, the matter of recognition as a legitimate national liberation movement is still open and may be relevant to the continuing opposition to the government.</p>

<p>Although not part of the right to participation in one's government, there are some additional striking features of the recent efforts to achieve greater participation in government in the Middle East that are worth considering. One is the use of the media, especially social media. In Egypt, young people used various social media to organize and to report on what was happening. The mainstream media was wrong footed and forced to catch up, often relying on social media reporting instead of their own reporters. </p>

<p>In Libya, the media became part of the conflict. While CNN, BBC and some local media had become part of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dutifully did so again, the role played by Al-Jazeera was unique. Al-Jazeera, which had gained a reputation for independence, appeared to cave in to pressure from the Qatari government and to offers allowing the network to enter lucrative US markets. Its bias became so accentuated that it was describing events in Tripoli from Benghazi and did not even mention NATO involvement in the armed conflict for the first several hours of its coverage of the NATO-led rebels' entry into Tripoli in the early morning of August 22, 2011.</p>

<p>For its part, the NATO-led rebel uprising in Libya shows that people may be able to overthrow their government with outside military intervention. Crucial to legitimizing this intervention, many will argue, is the apparent cover of the UN. Others, <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">including this writer</a>, have pointed out that when cover itself appears to lack legitimacy, it merely devalues the UN by providing a fig leaf to obscure the malicious intentions of foreign powers. While there can be no denying that the recent events in the Middle East exemplify an increasing demand by people in the region to participate in their own government, the diverse manners in which such demands have been made indicate that both legal and illegal forms have been used.</p>

<p>When demands for participation are made using illegal means, the legitimacy of the demand itself may be called into question. This is not to devalue the demands of any people for greater participation in their government, but to preserve respect for the rule of international law. In the long term, it is agreed rules, such as those of international law, which will allow people of diverse nations to live together in peace. When these agreed rules are ignored, circumvented or violated, international peace and security are threatened more than at any other time.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Frano, University of Pittsburgh Law School of Law Class of 2012, is a certified legal intern at the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/juris-doctor/clinics/environmental">University of Pittsburgh Environmental Law Clinic</a>. She writes on the growing popularity of natural gas as an energy source and the need to proactively implement international law and policy to regulate it...<hr height='1'><strong>T</strong>he history of environmental law is one of ad hoc decision-making. Historically, environmental legislative change has followed industrial age environmental disasters. Our environmental legal system is defined by the environmental damage inflicted on our land. Thus, the scars from industrialization not only mar our landscape, they also define our legal approach to healing and preserving it. </p>

<p>At present, we remain in the wake of two epic environmental disasters, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant failure. Both disasters are linked directly to the global demand for energy. As the supply of natural resources tightens, greater risks are required to retrieve less. Thus the scale of the potential impact broadens, creating transnational and global environmental problems. As public concern mounts and social unrest grows, lawmakers in many nations are faced with drafting laws aimed at achieving energy independence while sufficiently regulating the exploration, development and implementation of energy sources. In such an environment, we are sure to experience a new wave of environmental legislative change not seen since the 1970s. </p>

<p>The 1970s are often looked on as a time of a truly citizen-based environmental movement. In the wake of the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement, Americans such as Rachel Carson with her famous book <em>Silent Spring</em> forced lawmakers to adopt extensive and innovative provisions on the protection and preservation of the environment. However, the legal issues, public concern and increased risks surrounding energy consumption and development today can no longer be addressed entirely at the national level. Developing a legal framework to mitigate and prevent disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Fukushima will require an international environmental legal framework. </p>

<p>Currently, international environmental law consists primarily of laws governing policy and procedure; typically these laws do not have a direct impact until adopted by individual countries through domestic legislation. Alternatively, substantive or procedural "soft law" could be implemented in the form of rulemaking, agreements or standards. In either case, there is no international entity to govern the field outside of the existing networks and agreements between governmental organizations, hybrid private-public organizations and private bodies. Thus the field is governed predominately by national laws controlling the mediums to be used for exploiting and regulating energy consumption. </p>

<p>Although commonly referenced out of necessity, studying the environmental laws of varied nations can help lawmakers and policymakers to create an international environmental framework that is more effective in governing the widespread risk and impact of today's energy market. The EU offers an example of what an international system may look like. The EU utilizes a unique hybrid approach in which both private and public law governs. Within the EU, a myriad of tools are used to reach the goals of environmental protection and sustainable economic practices, including self-regulatory laws, agreements between private and public entities and economic instruments such as direct taxation of polluting substances. This flexible approach allows for more positive inducements and technological innovation than the traditional command and control model of national environmental governance used in the US. </p>

<p>European nations develop their statutory controls for energy development and management considering the economic, political, social and cultural influences of the individual nation. This flexible approach creates more opportunity for such influences to be incorporated in legal and policy frameworks. As this approach is implemented throughout the EU, the result is a broad spectrum of varied approaches. </p>

<p>Italy's approach to meeting its energy needs offers an example. In the first weeks of June 2011, the Italian people showed up in numbers not seen since the mid-1990s to vote on a referendum banning nuclear energy. The result, by a remarkable 95 percent majority, was to continue the ban on nuclear energy. Italy first abandoned its nuclear program following a similar referendum in 1987. Meanwhile, pro-nuclear France has taken a differing approach and has banned natural shale gas development. Then there is Germany, which in early summer 2011 announced its plan to move quickly towards nuclear independence. If the majority of countries are to follow the footsteps of Italy and Germany, we can only expect more dependence on natural gas as a key energy resource. Thus we can also expect necessary changes in the environmental laws accompanying the exploration, extensive pipeline transportation system, trade and consumption of this natural resource on the international front. Natural gas, once considered a relatively stable player in the energy market, is now projected by some to become a leading energy source in many countries throughout the world. This is due to relatively recent technological advancements that have made unconventional, or "shale gas," recoverable at a feasible price point. </p>

<p>Unconventional natural gas, which is primarily made up of shale gas sources, has now been estimated to be as large as conventional natural gas resources in production volume. Further, global social and political uncertainties impacting traditional energy supplies are seen by some as an opportunity for natural gas to displace other fossil fuels as an energy source. Additionally, natural gas is particularly interesting in this age of alleged green legislation because its use could lead to lower emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants as compared to oil or coal. Current production of unconventional natural gas is mainly based on the large-scale development in the US, particularly the Marcellus Shale Basin located primarily in Pennsylvania. Other American shale gas formations have been developed in Texas, Wyoming and Louisiana. </p>

<p>However, there is a much larger global shale gas supply that is now available due to these technological advancements. Some estimate these formations could sustain global consumption for over 200 years at current rates. Natural gas can be used for many applications, most notably gas-fired generation for electric power supply, industrial processing, home heating fuel, fuel for residential appliances and as an alternative fuel for transportation vehicles.</p>

<p>Currently, the US is largely self-sufficient when it comes to natural gas, but with China projected to become a large importer, US producers are stockpiling resources to participate in the expanding global trade of natural gas. In contrast, Italy depends primarily on Russia and Algeria for its natural gas imports, and current Italian production has been sinking since the mid-1990s. </p>

<p>With Italy's recent decision to continue to ban nuclear energy and the current <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">unrest in Libya</a>, a key oil supplier, it is likely to consider increasing its usage of natural gas as an energy source. Interestingly, Italy ranks in the top 10 countries for percentage of vehicles powered by natural gas, a small but intriguing use for the fossil fuel. So what will the Italians do to keep their energy consumption needs met while maintaining their commitment to ban nuclear energy? As of June 2011, two large exploration permits have been issued to energy companies allowing them to explore unconventional gas reserves. Their findings conclude that the Po Valley Basin in Northern Italy contains approximately 28 trillion cubic feet of methane. Though a major discovery for Italy, the natural gas would require a sufficient pipeline infrastructure, and some major pipeline production has stalled and other major pipeline projects are not projected to begin until 2017. The question for countries is not likely to be if they will develop their natural gas reserves, but when they will be able to do so.</p>

<p>Given that the production of this resource appears inevitable for at least some major countries in the world, it is natural that the new age of environmental legislation will incorporate laws governing its management. In fact, studying the national legal frameworks surrounding natural gas is likely to offer a solid example of how the global environmental stakeholders will generally address environmental issues through the law. Perhaps most significantly, this subject will allow us to test the international, regional and national concepts related to environmental policies and values of sustainable development, environmental conservation and pollution control. In a general sense, environmental protection in the law boils down to assigning more weight to environmental factors as opposed to the factors focused on traditionally, such as economic, social and scientific value, personal property and individual rights. An international environmental law framework will be tested by the varied national views on how to weigh these factors. Hopefully the opportunity will be taken to preemptively avoid problems rather than retroactively attempting to lessen their effects in the wake of a disaster, as has been the pattern historically. </p>

Bush indicated that the country was facing a different type of enemy in the twenty-first century. The nameless, faceless and borderless enemy was terrorism and for the first time the front was in America. The attack on the World Trade Center, the symbol of global finance and capitalism, and the Pentagon, the heart of the US national security command, caused a catastrophic loss of life and an unprecedented threat to the national sense of well being. President Bush's objective was to eradicate the evils of terrorism, which meant that the conflict did not end with al-Qaeda or the Taliban. It also included other terrorist militant organizations in Iraq, Palestine, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran and North Korea.</p>

<p>The Bush administration's record in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, included the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, the disruption of al-Qaeda's power infrastructure and the capture or killing of some of the terrorist organization's worst Islamist militants. It also included a violation of international human rights standards. Due to this, the Bush administration failed to reduce anti-American sentiment across the globe. With the historic election of Barack Obama in 2008, came the perception that Americans would witness a significant departure from the Bush administration's national security and counterterrorism policies. During the campaign, Obama pledged to make the country's counterterrorism policy more consistent with constitutional principles and international law.</p>

<p>For all of the Obama administration's rhetoric claiming that it has chartered an entirely new approach to counterterrorism policy, the record to date clearly indicates the contrary. It may be a case of message over substance as it relates to the following:<ul><li>The <a href="/feature/2011/06/libya.php#guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> prison facility remains open as a symbol of torture and repression, and some detainees will continue to be held there indefinitely without trial;</li><li>Water boarding and enhanced interrogation techniques have stopped, but they had already ceased under Bush in 2006;</li><li>An expanded program for detaining alleged terrorists is underway in Bagram, Afghanistan;</li><li>Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rendition">renditions</a> continue to help provide alleged foreign terrorists to friendly foreign governments, who may have their own interrogation standards;</li><li>Obama's expanded program of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=targeted+killings">targeted killings</a> via drone aircraft is clearly evidenced in Afghanistan;</li><li>Broad electronic surveillance of terrorist suspects continues under Obama with legislative authorization; and</li><li>The longstanding practice of invoking the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets">state secrets doctrine</a> continues to be utilized to quash litigation against the government's actions.</ul>There is far more consistency with respect to Bush administration policies than was anticipated, particularly in the war against al-Qaeda. Under Obama, Afghanistan has become the military's top priority in the war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. More than 100,000 troops and support personnel have been committed in the past two years. Obama initially maintained that the US is not in Afghanistan to control that country. However, his war strategies are strikingly similar to those employed by Bush in Iraq. The number of troops has surged and counterinsurgency and nation-building have become the core strategies. Obama's principal goal is to promote good governance and legitimacy in the eyes of the local population.</p>

<p>Obama's strategy has revolved around denying sanctuary to insurgents. Training local security forces to hold territory so the insurgents cannot return is pivotal. Building infrastructure and eliminating political corruption&#8212;thereby winning the "hearts and minds" of the population is also a key part of the plan. The local government should take the lead in any longer-term counterinsurgency strategy. Locals have more legitimacy and are familiar with the language, culture, geography, history and political landscape.</p>

<p>The US war against al-Qaeda has become a war against the Taliban and the Pashtun, the tribes living in both Afghanistan and Pakistan who have been successfully fighting foreign adversaries for several centuries. No one has ever effectively defeated the Pashtuns; not the British, the Soviets, or now, the Americans. Obama vowed to reduce the presence of American troops to about 25,000 by 2014, when the Afghan government would assume responsibility. This war is the longest in American history. It has cost more than 1,700 American lives, multiple thousands of Afghan lives and over a half trillion dollars. According to the Congressional Research Service, it will cost America $113.7 billion for FY2012 as compared to $43.5 billion as recently as FY2008.</p>

<p>America is a vital lifeline for Afghan President Hamid Karzai's control of the country and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's government in Pakistan. The US needs Pakistan's cooperation to successfully withdraw troops from Afghanistan next year and further down the road in 2014 and 2015. Continued American economic and military aid is critical given the vulnerability that exists to the Pashtun Taliban, the feared Haqqani network, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba terrorist organization, all of which have links to al-Qaeda and are committed to the destabilization of both nations.</p>

<p>As the US military and civilian presence and spending decrease, there will be a direct impact on the economies of Afghanistan and Pakistan. These nations may fall into an economic and military abyss. The Karzai government is considered corrupt, illegitimate and incapable of unifying Afghanistan. Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, which is perched at the crossroads of the Middle East and South Asia, could become susceptible to terrorist attacks. There is deep worry in the Obama administration about Pakistan's vulnerability to Islamist extremists. Pakistan's army is bogged down fighting its own Taliban. Insurgents have attacked key military installations by infiltrating the military's rank and file. A rapid US withdrawal could further destabilize Pakistan.</p>

<p>Despite the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama Bin Laden</a>, and his second-in-command, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was instrumental in overseeing al-Qaeda's daily operation, there still exists a solid core target list of terrorists that are leading groups in places like Somalia and Yemen. There are different forms and organizations of radical extremists that are not about to disappear. Bin Laden's elimination is of great symbolic significance because it represents a watershed in the fight against terrorism, and should not be minimized, particularly in light of developments during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">spring uprisings</a> in <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a>, Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, Yemen and Syria. It remains to be seen whether the Obama administration's approach to counterterrorism, particularly as it relates to the commitment to Afghanistan and Pakistan, can avoid the serious political damage manifested by the failed Bush strategy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/profile/goodwingillg">Guy Goodwin-Gill</a> of the University of Oxford Faculty of Law says that the Palestinian UN statehood bid presents a unique and critical question of legitimate representation on the international stage for Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and in the diaspora which must be resolved in order to ensure that statehood results in greater rights protections for the Palestinian people...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/guygoodwingill.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n August 2011, I drafted an <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/238962-final-pdf-plo-statehood-opinionr-arb.html">opinion</a> on certain legal questions put to me regarding the issue of "popular representation," so far as they might arise in the context of the push to have the State of Palestine admitted as a member of the UN. The opinion provoked considerable comment, including by those who admitted to not having read it, but the overall result appears to have been a stimulating debate about the linkages between statehood, UN membership and representation of the people of Palestine. As I am not able to deal individually with the numerous questions and requests for further comment, the following paragraphs are my personal attempt to put some of the issues into the wider context of democratic accountability. </p>

<p>A central issue is whether the "democratic representation" of states involves any questions of international law. Here, we are very much on the threshold of normative progress, and the question of Palestine presents certain unique dimensions; how they are dealt with may in turn contribute to how the law in general develops in the years ahead. </p>

<p>The long-standing international recognition of the rights of all Palestinians alters the traditionalist position which would otherwise draw a distinction between the internationally accepted representatives of the state and those, the people, for whom they claim to speak and to act. This qualification has implications, not so much for the acceptance of the State of Palestine as such (for states in their practice can modify the rules if they want), as for the forms by which the rights of Palestinians are to be further and better protected through statehood in international organizations. </p>

<p>Having long since recognized the right to self-determination of all Palestinians, the international community evidently has a legal and political interest in who effectively represents them in the UN. This does not mean that it has a right to impose any particular system of government or representation on the State of Palestine as it moves towards UN membership. Rather, it has a valid interest in looking for evidence of connection between representation and an exercise of the popular will. </p>

<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this interpretation of a long and rich history does not in any way alter the criteria for UN membership. It is more an attempt to outline one of those somewhat inchoate legal interests, not uncommon in the international legal system, where only the foundations and some of the structure of rights are presently in place. </p>

<p>Moreover, that interest of the international community of states is accompanied by responsibilities to assist in building national capacity in pursuit of good governance and democratization, as seen in General Assembly resolutions <a href="/forum/6412.pdf">64/12</a> [PDF] and <a href="/forum/64155.pdf">64/155</a> [PDF]. This is not just a matter of allowing voices to be heard, therefore, but of translating voices into representation and political action.</p>

<p><strong>Self-determination and the UN</strong> </p>

<p>Though it opens with the resounding words, "We the Peoples of the United Nations," the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> remains, of course, the constitutional basis for an international organization of states, and it is states which are its members and directly represented, rather than the people or peoples who stand behind them. This is unexceptional, reflecting the traditional position in international law, where the principal subjects are states. Who represents the state&#8212;in a society configured by principles of sovereignty and nonintervention&#8212;was long seen as beyond the reach of international law. "Effective government" and independence from others were what mattered, together with acceptance or recognition by the governments of other states. </p>

<p>The Charter locates the principle of self-determination squarely within the UN's purposes, but how that should translate into practice was never prescribed. "Statehood" thus remains the necessary qualification for membership of most international organizations, and in the UN context, the political process of acceptance and admission as a state is by decision of the General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council. </p>

<p>An additional twist in the overall picture, however, is provided by the law and practice of recognition. Ideally, this might just be a matter of declaring the facts&#8212;a state exists&#8212;but historically other states have often also included a discretionary element in their practice, reflecting their willingness or not to enter into normal diplomatic relations with the new state on the block, or with a new government which has established effective authority over all or part of the territory of an already existing state. </p>

<p>Within this mix of law, fact and politics, UN membership counts for a lot, but it cannot answer all the questions. During times of intense political divide, such as the Cold War, states were denied UN membership, whether or not they met the formal requirements of Article 4 of the Charter, while in less contested times, even entities falling short of the criteria of statehood have been admitted. There is thus an uneasy connection, moderated by politics, between statehood, eligibility for UN membership, and self-determination, particularly at the point of representation at the international level. </p>

<p>For the people of Palestine, these issues come together in a telling way, for those displaced since 1948 and their descendants constitute more than half of the people of Palestine. The General Assembly has repeatedly stressed that "the Palestinian people is the principal party to the question of Palestine," for example, in resolutions <a href="/forum/3210.pdf">3210 (XXIX)</a> [PDF], <a href="/forum/3236.pdf">3236 (XXIX)</a> [PDF] and <a href="/forum/3375.pdf">3375 (XXX)</a> [PDF]; and on no occasion has it drawn any distinctions on the basis of place of residence. It is thus the people of Palestine, as a whole, who possess the right to return and the right to self-determination. </p>

<p>Historically, these have been among the critical constituent elements in the movement for liberation. Given the obstacles faced by the people&#8212;not the least being exile and a divided land&#8212;it is hardly surprising that the modalities for achieving democratic, representative and accountable government in a future state and in the interests of all Palestinians have either been sidelined by momentarily greater concerns, or left pending for later, in some imagined period to come of calm transition and reflection. Nor is this exceptional. In practice, states commonly emerge and are accepted during ongoing conflict, or during the chaotic aftermath of state-building. At such times, often only the distant promise of elections can be offered to a people whose struggle for national liberation seems best achieved for now by the international recognition of their state. What is different in the Palestinian case, however, is the emphasis given both to return and to self-determination. </p>

<p>In addition, things move on, and international law is no different. Over the last 15 to 20 years, both states and international organizations have started to review assumptions about sovereignty, and to ask whether the right to represent a state internationally should perhaps be contingent on a clear link to a valid expression of the will of the people. Even at the 1945 San Francisco Conference, some delegates spoke of self-determination as necessarily reflecting the free and genuine expression of the will of the people, even if any talk then of a "right" to representative or democratic government would have been premature. But the idea itself persists. <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a21">Article 21(3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>, adopted just three years later, declares that, "The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government." Some 30 years ago, the noted international lawyer, Antonio Cassese, remarked that the exercise of self-determination implies the freedom of the people to choose their model of internal and external governance, and that in turn requires opportunity and, among others, effective protection of related freedoms of association and speech. In the 1980s, it was still doubted whether international law, in a positive, normative sense, had anything to say about representative, let alone democratic government, and even today election observation and UN electoral activities remain sensitive issues. </p>

<p>UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali nevertheless gave impetus to the democracy debate as an element integral to three position papers put out in the 1990s&#8212;<a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/SG/agpeace.html">An Agenda for Peace</a>, <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/SG/agdev.html">An Agenda for Development</a>, and <a href="http://www.getcited.org/pub/100288260">An Agenda for Democratization</a>. The General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council, and the Human Rights Committee have likewise maintained a focus on the democratic imperative. In related developments, the idea that intervention is acceptable in support of democratically elected governments has <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">gained traction in Africa</a> and Latin America, while the UN itself has continued to provide electoral assistance to new and restored democracies. As UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan noted presciently in 2003, "just as the price of exclusion is often violence, the benefit of political inclusion is a much better prospect of stability." </p>

<p>For its part, the Human Rights Committee has confirmed the link between elections and representative democracy, noting that it is implicit in <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm#art25">Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> that representatives who exercise governmental power are accountable through the electoral process for their exercise of that power. </p>

<p>The move to enhance the Palestinian presence in the UN through "statehood" nevertheless carries the risk of fragmentation&#8212;where the state represents the people within the UN and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the people outside the UN. Such a division of representation would run counter to the status quo and to the original intent of the international community in recognizing the PLO. The challenge is to maintain unity in these unique circumstances. </p>

<p>Would that be achieved by having the PLO as the representative of the state in the UN? It might well do, if the appropriate form of words could be found. The bottom line, however, remains the will of the people, and any substantive change in the present institutional arrangements for representation calls for approval through an expression of the popular will, followed by international recognition equivalent to that given to date, for example, by the General Assembly and the Arab League. </p>

<p><strong>Elections and the Will of the People</strong> </p>

<p>In recent years, numerous international, regional and non-governmental organizations have striven to flesh out what it means, as a matter of international law, to require of states that they follow the path of free and fair elections. Although different perceptions remain, it is increasingly accepted that popular participation is necessarily linked to rights&#8212;the right to be recognized as a person at law and hence to be registered and enabled to vote, the right of universal suffrage, the right to associate for political purposes, to establish political parties, to freedom of expression, to the secret ballot, and to a transparent and verifiable ballot count, among others.</p>

<p>Is there any reason why, in the case of Palestine, any of this should wait? The challenge for the people of Palestine and for those who speak for them today is probably unique in the perspective of "state-building" and democratic development. It is to move consciously and openly from internationally accepted institutional representation into the traditional state model, but without losing the legitimacy that comes from the voice of the people&#8212;to a model, therefore, in which all Palestinians continue to be represented, and are seen to be represented, in and through the UN. </p>

<p>Obviously, the situation in the West Bank and Gaza and among the diaspora is different from much of what has come before. Can mechanisms not be devised and put in place which would ensure the most free and ample participation of the people of Palestine in determining their future system of governance and, in the immediate and short term, the nature and composition of their representation at the international level? </p>

<p>The goal of elections and democratic reform has long been on the PLO agenda. Is this not the time&#8212;the very best of times&#8212;to take that almost unprecedented step for a people on the threshold of UN membership, namely, to seek and to heed the will of the people? </p>

<p>Why should the people not be registered, for example? Voting by refugees and the displaced is nothing new; both the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), as well as host states, have contributed in the past to the processes of registration, balloting and counting. As noted above, the international community and the UN have responsibilities here, and considerable experience also in building and strengthening capacity. </p>

<p><strong>The Democratic Imperative</strong> </p>

<p>The IPU's 1997 <a href="http://www.ipu.org/cnl-e/161-dem.htm">Universal Declaration on Democracy</a> underlines that democracy presupposes a "genuine partnership between men and women," "free political competition," and "open, free and non-discriminatory participation by the people, exercised in accordance with the rule of law, in both letter and spirit." In David Beetham's words, "representative" means "reflecting the most important characteristics of the electorate, in the matter of geographical distribution, political opinion, and social composition," while political equality means that, "everyone counts for one." </p>

<p>As the drive for Palestinian statehood gathers momentum, understandably given the intransigence of certain parties and the obstacles repeatedly placed in the way of progress, that one important question still raises its head: Who will represent the people of and in the state? Of what value, democratically, are historical declarations of intent? Or assertions of present authority? Or the status quo? People's expectations of government have moved on and democracy requires representative institutions and the mechanisms to allow their functioning and change. In appropriate circumstances, their realization can be a joint, cooperative effort, but neither individual participation nor assent can be taken for granted, anymore than accountability to the people. </p>

<p>International law does not yet make democratic representative government a condition of statehood or even a condition of membership of the UN (regional organizations are another matter). But the character of government and representation is increasingly a matter of international concern and inquiry, while the people also increasingly embed their claims and their right to accountable government not only in local principles and precepts, but also in the rules and standards endorsed internationally. </p>

Smith</a> is remarkable because of its clear recognition that effective medical care for transgender people must include hormone therapy; its rejection as ineffective "treatment alternatives," such as the anti-depressants Wisconsin proposed to offer; and its dismissal of the state's claim that the medical treatments had been denied to keep transgender inmates secure. The decision follows a long history of cases recognizing Gender Identity Disorder (GID), the medical condition that impacts many transgender individuals, as a serious medical need, but sets the record straight regarding the importance of hormone therapy to treat GID. It puts to rest a blatantly discriminatory piece of legislation passed due to popular biases being put ahead of medical research, singling out a small group of inmates, and blocking medical treatments necessary only for them.</p>

                <p>The Seventh Circuit recognized the importance of medical treatment for transgender inmates in 1987, when it definitively stated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15395080476113300514">Meriwether v. Faulkner</a> that GID is a serious medical condition that demands treatment. The <em>Meriwether</em> court stopped short of ordering any specific treatment, such as hormone therapy, however. Securing effective medical treatment for GID has been a challenge for transgender inmates ever since, largely because courts' already ample deference to the decisions made by prison administrators and prison doctors has, if anything, only grown since 1987.  </p>

                <p>There have been exceptions to the many cases denying transgender inmates treatment when courts have been faced with particularly egregious instances of a transgender inmate being denied effective treatment, such as <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2553534673493480242">De'Lonta v. Angelone</a>, where a transgender female inmate engaged in genital self-mutilation after being taken off hormone therapy because of a blanket prison policy, rather than medical judgment. This inspired the Fourth Circuit to reverse the district court's dismissal of De'Lonta's case. There have also been some unfavorable decisions made without the benefit of a complete factual record, including qualified expert testimony, often in cases brought by transgender inmates acting pro se. Examples include another Seventh Circuit decision, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4233601323210127600">Maggert v. Hanks</a>, in which the court, after noting that the plaintiff had never been diagnosed with GID, reached several surprising and inaccurate conclusions about transgender medical care. These included the finding that effective treatment for GID always requires sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and that such treatment is extremely expensive, therefore justifying its denial. The <em>Fields</em> court reviewed the trial evidence&#8212;which tested and disproved the empirical assumptions behind the <em>Maggert</em> ruling&#8212;and put aside the <em>Maggert</em> court assumptions in favor of the facts supporting the district court's decision.</p>

                <p>A major barrier to accessing transgender medical care is just how politically unpopular it is to provide such care, especially to prisoners. The <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2005/related/acts/105">Inmate Sex Change Prevention Act</a>, struck down by the <em>Fields</em> court, passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of the Wisconsin legislature and was signed into law by a Democratic governor. Fortunately, doctors are less likely to bow to the popular will behind such laws than are legislators. The top medical administrators at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections criticized the proposed act during their legislative testimony, describing the necessity of medical treatment for transgender persons, the harms inflicted on inmates by denying them treatment, and the burdens on the prison staff forced to address the life-threatening symptoms of untreated GID, such as depression and suicide attempts.  </p>

                <p>Powerful testimony from the prison medical administrators and some highly qualified transgender medical care experts led the district court to conclude that the act violated the Eighth Amendment, with which the Seventh Circuit agreed:  "Surely, had the Wisconsin legislature passed a law that ... inmates with cancer must be treated only with therapy and pain killers, this court would have no trouble concluding that the law was unconstitutional. Refusing to provide effective treatment for a serious medical condition serves no valid penological purpose and amounts to torture." One hopes that a day will arrive soon when public sentiment about transgender people has improved, but until then it is gratifying to know that the courts are willing to offer some level of protection against the serious harm transgender persons have experienced for far too long.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://law.utoledo.edu/facultystaff/faculty/BDavis/BDavis.htm">Benjamin Davis</a> of the University of Toledo College of Law says that despite the plethora of legal and cultural changes that have occurred in the US since September 11, 2001, international law remains the same as it was a decade ago, and that the changes which have occurred in the US have moved it further from international law and its own founding principles...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/bdavis200.png"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>E</b></font>verything must change so that everything can stay the same." - Il Gattopardo, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa.<br />
 <br />
As the events of September 11, 2001, were happening, I was teaching an Alternative Dispute Resolution class at Texas Wesleyan Law School. Among the points of discussion for that day's negotiation readings was the question of how to negotiate with Middle Eastern terrorists. Once news broke, students ran out of class sobbing to check on family and friends working at American Airlines. After making sure those students were safely able to get on their way, I thought about whether to cancel class, but instead decided to ask my remaining students to imagine that President George W. Bush intended to meet with them and seek their advice on what he should do about the crisis. I emphasized that we are all impacted by the same emotions, including the president. However, each student was told to think objectively in order to give the best advice possible to the president. Of the various suggestions that were made, what stood out then and what continues to stand out for me today was the comment of an older student who had been in the Navy, who said that our first task was to go back to our fundamental principles, and then decide where to go from there.<br />
 <br />
Ten years later, it appears that the fundamental instruments, and therefore the rules and principles of international law, have not changed. None of the international agreements forming the core of international humanitarian law, human rights law, or even <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/t1a0k4u9l4hls">Article 51 of the UN Charter</a> have been altered since 9/11, nor has customary international law. Even if we look at the complicity of many states in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rendition">rendition</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=torture">torture</a>, the approach was clearly not done out of a sense that the law had changed. So, with regard to all of the concerns of <a href="/feature/featured/911/">this JURIST Feature</a> with national security, Guantanamo, civil liberties, human rights and the law of war since 9/11, international law has not changed.<br />
 <br />
So if international law has not changed, what has changed? Among the changes are the policy, practice and domestic law of the US. Further, the security state has expanded in an unprecedented manner at the federal, state and local level, with surveillance being a permanent feature in the lives of Americans. Law enforcement and armed conflict paradigms are traded with and against an ostensibly new self-defense paradigm to provide legal rationales for the use of various types of force in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">Somalia</a> and surely other places around the world. </p>

<p>While it is said that torture is no longer performed, meaningful high-level accountability for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment has so far been blocked. The detention facilities at <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php#guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> have been opened, expanded, announced to be closed, and yet have remained. The US domestic crime of material support for terrorism and material witness statutes have morphed into terrorism fighting tools. History has been reinterpreted as far back as the Seminole Wars to argue that some domestic law of war crimes are to be applied as if they were international law of war crimes pursuant to congressional definitions in the ersatz justice of the military commissions. Courts have used or expanded doctrines of state secrets and national security at the request of the federal government to block redress to foreigners for excesses alleged to have been committed. Ironically, one can get more evidence about "torture flights" in a garden variety commercial contract dispute in a New York court than through any procedure attempting to redress the consequences of physical and psychological violence.<br />
 <br />
The architects of these American policies, whether political leaders from the executive or legislature, lawyers, psychologists and many others, blithely walk the streets unimpeded and often times heralded in media and print. Our government works overtime to dissuade foreign or international tribunals from disturbing these architects of the new US and its policies in the world. Taking the country to war in Iraq on false pretenses is bemoaned by some, challenged by others, but nonetheless eventually forgotten.<br />
 <br />
The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a> reveals state security apparatuses and their roles in aspects of the American-led War on Terror. Books are published in which political leaders sing the praises of their decisions. At the same time, detainees are shifted around, or languish incommunicado. Some have been driven insane by their treatment. <br />
 <br />
Of course, the major change since 9/11 is the thousands who died or were injured that day and those who continue to suffer health issues, in addition to those who have died or been wounded in the ensuing conflicts, civil unrest and civil wars since. We should remember all the dead and wounded as we keep them, and the future of this world, in our prayers.  </p>

<p>In sum, international law has not changed but the US has. A more fundamental inquiry, however, is whether it is only American leaders who have changed, or is it also the ordinary Americans who have changed? Have Americans kept faith with their fundamental principles or have they succumbed to panic and fear and become more coldly indifferent to the world? This is the question that haunts me.<br />
 <br />
I have been struck by the inability of Americans to countenance criminal prosecution of high-level civilians while permitting it in the cases of low level persons. Charles Graner, a low-level ringleader at Abu Ghraib, was recently released from prison, yet the high level types like Dick Cheney, Porter Goss, George Tenet, Donald Rumsfeld, Jay Bybee, John Yoo, John Rizzo and the rest, who created a torture superstructure in the American military and intelligence apparatus, are made to fear nothing. They protect themselves relentlessly through a smokescreen defense of mid-level intelligence professionals and military that did their bidding. Alternatively, they point to the current administration's passivity in seeking their accountability and urge us to see that as vindication through continuity. Further, on the Iraq war, the broad consensus among the American people that their leaders lied to them has not lead to accountability for those former leaders. Rather, quite interestingly, the Iraq war is examined as a "model of intervention" (to be compared, for example, to <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a>) as if unleashing an aggressive war without the authorization of the UN Security Council nor a basis in Article 51 of the UN Charter was just another acceptable "policy option" for the US in the world. On both fronts, leaders of our foreign counterparts mirror our fecklessness at home in turning a blind eye to demands for accountability and justice.</p>

<p>What seems to be lost from view is that the professed "tough on terrorism" American leaders have done much to weaken America by abandoning fundamental American principles. As leaders draw from the darker chapters of American history to find precedents for what they seek to do, there appears to be little willingness to step back and ask why those parts of history were left in the dark. The willingness of leaders to recall these dark chapters demonstrates an almost pathological misapprehension of what the American project is. A city upon a hill cannot wallow in these dark chapters of history.</p>

<p>What is to be done? Those who oppose these dark matters that fill our present and recent past must continue to shed light on what is going on as a form of earnest struggle to reclaim the American project. Americans must continue to insist on accountability for those in past and current administrations who betrayed our fundamental principles and the peremptory norms of international law. Keeping in mind those who died and were wounded on 9/11, we must renew our faith in the best aspects of American history. International law has not changed and is not in crisis. What has changed is American law and, as is seen sadly each day, it is America that is in crisis.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Cali-Vasquez, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2012, is the author of the sixth article in a ten part <a href="/forum/2011/09/leonard-baynes-series-introduction.php">series</a> from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a> under the direction of Professor Leonard Baynes. Andrew writes on credit default swap position limits under the recent financial reform legislation... <br /><hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/andrewcalivasquez.jpeg" height='200' align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><strong>O</strong>ne of the primary objectives of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.04173:">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> is to protect investors by reducing risk in the financial markets. In light of the recent subprime collapse and ongoing economic downturn, such remedial measures are undoubtedly appropriate. However, unexpected consequences could impinge upon the operations of domestic businesses by reducing the availability of financing. As such, regulators are faced with the challenge of implementing a framework that balances the need for risk reduction with the availability of financing for local businesses.</p>

<p>Title VII of Dodd-Frank gives regulators the authority to impose "position limits" on a wide variety of over-the-counter derivatives, including credit default swaps (CDS). A position limit restricts the size or number of contracts that a single trader may own of a particular derivative. Position limits were first implemented in the agricultural commodities markets, successfully discouraging excess speculation and price manipulation.</p>

<p>A CDS is a contract that protects the CDS-buyer against the risk of default of a bond or loan. When an entity borrows money, the lender is exposed to the borrower's risk of default, or credit risk. A CDS allows the lender to pass the borrower's credit risk to the CDS-seller, in exchange for which the lender, or CDS-buyer, makes periodic payments to the CDS-seller. In the event of default, the CDS-seller makes a single payment to the CDS-buyer, usually for the face value of the loan or bonds. Through this process, the CDS-buyer protects itself against the risk of the borrower defaulting on its repayment obligations.</p>

<p>CDS liquidity is beneficial to debt market liquidity. Because CDS provide protection against the risk of default, lenders are more willing to lend knowing that they can readily and affordably obtain CDS protection. The secondary debt market, in which bonds and loans are resold to investors, also benefits from the protection afforded by CDS. This in turn increases secondary market liquidity, as participants can readily purchase protection against default and thus, are more willing to purchase debt. The combination of increased liquidity in the primary and secondary markets makes financing more readily available and more affordable. Businesses, particularly small and new businesses with less certain cash flows, are sensitive to lending liquidity constraints. In the event of poor lending liquidity, what might be a matter of borrowing on less favorable terms or financial belt-tightening for a larger, more well-established company could be financial ruin for a smaller or less established company that is more vulnerable to credit constraints.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed position limits for commodity derivatives referencing 28 different commodities. One of the frequently raised concerns is that too severely limiting the size of positions that traders could take would decrease liquidity.</p>

<p>In the CDS markets, position limits must balance liquidity preservation with the ability of CDS buyers and sellers to meet their contractual obligations. Position limits should take into account the net CDS position for a particular "reference obligation," the bond or loan referenced by the CDS, or sector of similar reference obligations, which would share similar credit risk. Ideally they would do this by netting together the "notionals," or face values, of like CDS held by a single trader. Position limits should also take into account non-CDS hedges, such as the bond or loan actually referenced by the CDS, or a bond or loan that has similar credit risk to the reference obligation, such as a company in the same industry. Companies within a particular industry often share similar credit risks; for example, agricultural companies in one region that produce identical crops would be equally sensitive to poor weather conditions in that region. Thus, a CDS referencing a loan to one such company would have similar credit risk to a loan, or CDS referencing a loan, to another such company. A trader holding that CDS and an offsetting loan, or offsetting CDS referencing a loan, to a related agricultural company as a hedge would have less credit risk than a trader holding a single CDS with no related offsetting position. Including the CDS and its related offset/hedge is a more accurate calculation of the trader's position than his CDS position alone, which incentivizes well-hedged, risk-averse trading strategies and reduces the restrictive effect of CDS position limits on lending liquidity, which would be far more severe were the position calculated based on the CDS alone.</p>

She writes on the conflict between an employee's right to nondiscrimination and an patient's right to choose their care provider in healthcare facilities...<br /><hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/saragronningsater.jpeg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecently, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12175147218935997244">Chaney v. Plainfield Healthcare Center</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a healthcare worker's right to a non-discriminatory workplace takes precedence over a patient's demand for a non-African American nursing assistant under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. Brenda Chaney was hired by Plainfield as a certified nursing assistant (CNA). Her duties included monitoring patients, responding to individual patient requests and assisting with their general daily living needs. One of Chaney's patients, Majorie Latshaw, made a request to Plainfield that she not be cared for by any African American CNAs. As a result, Plainfield specifically wrote "Prefers No Black CNAs" on Chaney's daily assignment sheet. Plainfield acknowledged that the facility honors the racial preferences of its patients. Despite adhering to the discriminatory requests of patients and enduring abuse from coworkers, Chaney was fired after three months of work for allegedly using an offensive word in front of a patient. Asserting her Title VII right to a non-hostile work environment, Chaney brought suit against Plainfield. <em>Chaney v. Plainfield Healthcare Center</em> demonstrates that racial discrimination still exists despite the achievements of the civil rights movement and the progress of recent decades. Ridding society of discrimination is not as easy as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5953121648351032724">Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1</a>: "The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."</p>

<p>Although it has been 44 years since the enactment of Title VII, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin, some nursing home facilities still allow overt discrimination to occur, such as Plainfield's policy of honoring the racial preferences of its patients. The reality is that nursing homes throughout the country have allowed patients to assert discriminatory preferences at the expense of their employees. However, because care facilities generally settle with plaintiffs that bring Title VII claims, the frequency with which these claims are brought is not publicized. </p>

<p>While it is relatively clear that an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of race under Title VII, the right of a patient to express discriminatory requests under the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act, enacted as part of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:H.R.3545:">Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987</a> (OBRA 87) is less straightforward. OBRA 87 states that patients have a right to "choose their care provider," and many long-term care facilities interpret this right as being free from limitations and as superior to an employee's right to a non-discriminatory workplace. Due to the conflict, Congress should amend OBRA 87 to include a nondiscrimination provision consistent with Title VII. Since the Seventh Circuit's decision sets precedent only in that circuit and applies only to cases within its jurisdiction, it is possible for other circuits to have contrary holdings on a similar set of facts. As such, amending OBRA 87 to include a nondiscrimination provision would standardize and harmonize the competing laws, creating bright-line principles regarding a patient's right to choose and an employee's right to a non-hostile work environment.</p>

<p>Care facilities rightfully fear what seems to be the gray area between adhering to a patient's preferences and protecting the rights of its employees. There is no contention that the Seventh Circuit wrongly decided Chaney's claim, nonetheless, in addition to amending OBRA 87, more needs to be done to eradicate patient-initiated discrimination in health care facilities. The Seventh Circuit's holding has brought the issue of patient discrimination to the forefront, and the problem should not be ignored. While alleviating the problem will likely entail more than the mere suggestions set forth by the court, its decision does offer a number of suggestions for long-term care facilities attempting to balance patient and employee rights.   </p>

<p>With a culturally diverse group of patients under the care of a facility, and with an equally diverse staff, caretakers must understand and be able to effectively communicate with their patients. Numerous factors play a role in effective communication and conflict resolution, but one major factor is cultural competency. Providing cultural competency training and making it mandatory for individuals that work in the nursing field would certainly facilitate the resolution of some of the issues that nursing homes face. However, cultural competency will not solve every conflict, and it is likely that it would not have helped in Brenda Chaney's case. It is very unlikely that Latshaw's discriminatory attitude would change during the duration of her residency in Plainfield's facility, particularly in light of her age and medical condition, and there is very little that a care facility can do to improve cultural competency beyond its walls. Nonetheless, allowing patients in long-term care facilities to assert their racial preferences and allowing employers to honor those preferences is an impediment to establishing the equality that so many have worked to achieve. While improving cultural competency is a start, more needs to be done to reform the law and the way of thinking.</p>

<p>In addition to providing cultural competency training, care facilities should work with patients to reform the behaviors that create a hostile work environment. Behavior contracting is one way to work towards reforming a patient's behavior, as it gives the patient and the facility the opportunity to work together to facilitate a better relationship. The facility would have the opportunity to express the desired behavior it wishes of the patient, for example allowing any nurse, regardless of race or religion, to care for the patient in the most appropriate manner. Moreover, the patient could express what the facility could do to make the patient feel more comfortable, such as educating its care providers about a particular patient's beliefs, cultural preferences and wishes for personal care. Furthermore, at a time when the patient is feeling a loss of autonomy, the contract gives him or her some control.</p>

<p>The issue set forth in Chaney is a reminder that things are not necessarily as society wishes or believes them to be. Decisions like the Seventh Circuit's are an important reminder that more needs to be done both in society and in the law to support equality in the work place. It is important that there is a collaborative effort between the judiciary, the legislature and employers to identify discriminatory actions and deal with them in a consistent manner. Amending OBRA 87 is one way to deal with the confusion surrounding a "patient's rights to choose." This would standardize the law and create a bright-line rule. On the other hand, care facilities that provide cultural competency training to their employees and engage in behavior contracts with hostile patients can work to directly address issues of discrimination that occur within their walls. The sooner overt bigotry is dealt with, the less harm it will have on individual members of society and society as a whole.</p>

		<title>Updating the Way &amp;apos;Parent&amp;apos; is Defined in New York Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melanie Lazarus, St. John's University School of Law Class of 2012, is the author of the ninth article in a ten part <a href="/forum/2011/09/leonard-baynes-series-introduction.php">series</a> from the staffers of the <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/law/journals/jcred">Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development</a> under the direction of Professor Leonard Baynes. She writes on the need for New York to update the way it defines "parent" for custodial and childcare purposes...<br /><hr height='1'><br /><strong>U</strong>ndoubtedly, there are people on both sides of the political spectrum who saw last summer's decision in the New York case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3629483764966719615">Debra H. v. Janice R</a> as a victory. However, spinning the Court of Appeals decision as a victory or defeat, or anything other than an opportunity to discuss how we define "parent" in practice for the purpose of determining rights and obligations is shortsighted. </p>

<p>The case involved a woman petitioning for visitation with the child she raised with her lesbian partner, the child's biological mother, from the time he was born until the couple's relationship ended two-and-a-half years later. The Court of Appeals ruled that second-parent adoption, an option that was blocked by the biological parent in this case, represented sufficient protection in situations like this and, as such, there was no reason to explore alternative ways to define "parent" for the purpose of custody and visitation laws in New York. Those that support laws such as the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA), and that have continuously rallied against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=new+york+marriage">same-sex marriage and civil unions in New York</a>, spun the court's refusal to expand the definition of parent for the purpose of custody and visitation as a confirmation of "traditional family values." Conversely, some argued that the court's holding that Debra H. had standing to seek visitation with M.R., Janice H.'s biological child conceived during the couple's relationship, because of comity for the couple's Vermont civil union, was a step in the right direction, as it tended towards a more formal recognition of same-sex relationships in New York. Given the recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">legalization of same-sex marriage</a> in New York state, the latter interpretation seems to be more in line with the cultural climate of the state.  </p>

<p>However, regardless of the recent changes to New York law, this case still provides a valuable opportunity to discuss the person that had the most to lose, the child. However you define your own sexuality, or wherever you fall on the spectrum regarding other peoples' freedom to define their sexuality, the New York court's reaffirmation of the 19-year-old precedent set in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5433681493093283396">Alison D. v. Virginia M.</a>, which defined parent very narrowly according to <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/domestic-relations/DOM070_70.html">Domestic Relations Law &#167; 70</a>, could have an impact on you. This is not about homosexuality or heterosexuality; it is a chance to have a discussion about defining parenthood in a way that awards the appropriate people their requisite rights, and demands that the correct people fulfill their concurrent obligations. In fact, because the court stated outright that same-sex couples could, and should, take advantage of second parent adoption laws, the decision should not be seen as an intentional barrier to same-sex parenthood specifically. Issues of legal status for a non-biological, non-adoptive same-sex parents, where the biological parent would not consent to adoption, are absolutely no different than the issues that might be confronted by a stepparent that has been unable to adopt his or her stepchildren.  </p>

<p>What we should be talking about, for M.R. and every other child like him, is how we want to define parenthood. Currently, only biological and adoptive parents have a right to the care and custody of a child in New York. However, children do not think of parents as "mom" or "dad" because of a birth certificate, adoption certificate or DNA test, and neither should the court.  </p>

<p>To varying degrees, other states allow custody or visitation standing to be determined by the child and the possible parents' relationship (de facto/psychological parents) or by a voluntary assumption of parental duties (<em>in loco parentis</em>). These statutes are fraught with their own problems. De facto parent status is very discretionary and leads to inconsistent results. <em>In loco parentis</em> involves a personal choice to take on parental duties where legally none would otherwise exist and, therefore, ceases at the voluntary cessation of the performance of these duties. Additionally, both statuses exist in a limbo where the "second" parent may be considered equal to the biological or adoptive parent for some purposes and less than equal for others.  </p>

<p>What New York needs is for lawmakers and judges to remember why the space inside a parent's arms is a place of safety for children. They need to think back to what it was that their parents taught them and did for them that bestowed upon their parents a higher status than everyone else in their lives. They need to think about what they have done for their own children that they would do for no other. They need to sit down and come up with a list of things that make a parent "mommy" or "daddy" in a child's eyes. Then they need to think about things beyond a child's comprehension, such as planning for the child before and during his or her life, and they need to codify all of these things as factors a judge should consider when determining whether someone should have parental status. Too much discretion is always risky, but this is too important and too emotional an issue to be handled in the sterile, cold way it is currently dealt with.</p>

<p>A string of posts hypothesized how the plaintiff had contracted AIDS. One student opined that the plaintiff contracted AIDS through sexual activity with a horse on a cruise to Africa. Another student disagreed with that contention and posted that she contracted AIDS from sharing needles with heroin addicts, and then engaged in sexual activity with a baboon to spread the virus. Another defendant expressed a third view, that the plaintiff contracted AIDS, in addition to other sexually transmitted diseases, from a prostitute dressed as a fireman. </p>

<p>The plaintiff, undoubtedly mortified upon discovering these statements, sought recourse through the court system. The plaintiff brought an action for defamation. While one would think the law would be on the plaintiff's side, and that there is no way the legal system would allow such atrocious comments to be broadcasted without consequences, the claim failed for the simple reason that the posts did not constitute statements of fact. The court held that a reasonable reader would not believe that plaintiff contracted AIDS by having sex with a horse, a baboon or a male prostitute. Taken together, the statements can only be read as puerile attempts by adolescents to outdo each other. The court, however, made it a point to state that New York law does not provide a cognizable tort action for cyber-bullying. </p>

<p>Victims of cyber-bullying currently lack legal remedies. As noted above, a claim for defamation will not be sustained when statements made do not constitute facts. However, these cruel rumors and opinions, whether based in fact or not, are hurtful and damaging to victims. Likewise, criminal harassment and stalking statutes are often ineffective legal avenues. These laws were intended to fight offline problems and do not lend themselves to the distinct characteristics of online harassment and bullying. Prosecutors are heavily burdened with the task of trying to fit unique cyber-realm situations into the unyielding mold of existing laws. This is best illustrated by the acquittal of Lori Drew, the woman who drove 13 year-old Megan Meier to suicide. Drew pretended to be a teenage boy and tormented Megan via MySpace, saying that the world would be a better place without her. </p>

<p>Paradoxically, a bully is more likely to receive legal redress by claiming a First Amendment violation against a school for any disciplinary action in connection with cyber-bullying than a victim of bullying is to sustain a tort action. School officials are in the optimal position to police cyber-bullying. Bullies and victims are in close proximity within school house gates. Moreover, teachers and guidance counselors are adept at recognizing problematic behavior and bullying among students. However, as school officials respond to student bullying and employ disciplinary measures, they open themselves up to lawsuits alleging that they have violated the students' First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>The seminal standard for regulating student speech was announced 30 years ago by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5077682732460754043">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a>. The Court held that a school cannot discipline a student unless his or her speech materially and substantially interferes with the school's operations. The dilemma with cyber-speech and online-bullying is that much of the speech originates off campus, from a home computer, but is directed at a fellow classmate and the effects are undeniably felt within the school. School administrators are hesitant to employ disciplinary measures against a student when the offensive language occurs outside of school. Likewise, courts struggle to apply the traditional student speech framework to the unconventional situation of cyber-bullying. Lower court decisions are wildly inconsistent. All claim to apply the <em>Tinker</em> standard but with varying results. Not much can be gleaned from these lower court opinions, except that cyber-bullying has become a pandemic among teens and adolescents. The jurisprudence in this area of law is less than satisfying, to say the least. The anomalous result of cyber-bullies' First Amendment rights being vindicated and victims of bullying having their actions dismissed occurs all too often. </p>

<p>It is well settled that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gates. However, the trade-off is that many kids surrender all protections of the law and are subjected to incessant harassment at the hands of untouchable cyber-bullies. This repugnant speech is not within the purview of uninhibited, robust, wide-open debate that the First Amendment is aimed at protecting. It is time that the law moves into the twenty-first century and empowers schools to curb the fatal consequences of cyber-bullying. </p>

He writes on pre-conviction DNA collection in the UK and US...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/gilauslander.jpeg" height='200' align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he early twentieth century witnessed the scientific breakthrough that allowed law enforcement to use fingerprints to solve crimes, capture and convict criminals. However, in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, the use of DNA evidence for many of the same and various other applications has permitted it to surpass the importance of fingerprinting in the field of criminal justice. DNA, the genetic material that every living creature contains, can be extracted from nearly any biological residue that a person leaves behind. Therefore, the potential use of DNA in the criminal justice system is extraordinary. Society has embraced DNA evidence with fervor because it theoretically offers definitive proof of guilt or innocence. Nevertheless, despite the ever-expanding use of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system, it is an imprecise sword with equal potential to assist the government in combating criminality or to infringe on the right to privacy that many citizens hold dear. </p>

<p>Both the UK and the US, two nations with a rich and shared legal tradition and a deep commitment to individuals rights, have utilized DNA evidence in their criminal justice system. Despite these similarities, there are some significant differences in their approaches to DNA evidence. Until recently, the US has been hesitant to widely implement the use of DNA evidence. On the other hand, the UK has keenly embraced it. While both countries subscribe to the principle that individual privacy should be strenuously guarded against impermissible government intrusion, each has viewed the potential impact of DNA on individual privacy differently. Much of the contention regarding the use of DNA evidence in the US has surrounded the issue of collecting DNA before conviction. By contrast, in the UK, the greatest controversy concerns the retention of DNA profiles regardless of when the DNA was collected. </p>

<p>In the UK, two separate DNA regimes exist. Scotland employs a different DNA system than the other UK constituent countries. Both permit, and in fact require, the collection of DNA before an individual is convicted. The chief difference between the two systems is with respect to DNA retention. Despite being condemned by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=echr">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR), the DNA collection system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland permits the virtually indefinite retention of DNA, provided that the samples are used for law enforcement purposes. In contrast, Scotland, in nearly all circumstances, requires the destruction of DNA samples or profiles upon dismissal or acquittal. </p>

<p>The focus of litigation in US courts has been the timing of DNA collection rather than its retention. Much of the case law in the US concerns whether and under what circumstances DNA may be collected from defendants that have already been convicted of a crime. For example, cases have concerned when it is permissible to collect DNA from prison inmates, parolees and probationers. Recently, in response to changes in federal law, courts have begun to consider the constitutionality of DNA collection before conviction. Nevertheless, in contrast to the UK, which is bound by EU protections similar to the spirit and effect of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a>, the US has not seriously focused on issues of retention. </p>

<p>The approach to DNA in the UK and Scotland is more closely correlated to balancing the privacy rights of the individual while recognizing the interest of society at large to combat criminality. Notwithstanding the propriety of the UK's polemical retention system, both the DNA regimes used in the UK do permit the pre-conviction collection of DNA, and do so in a manner that reasonably upholds the balance between individual privacy and governmental interests. Once an individual is a suspect, and then arrested and subsequently indicted, his rights and liberties are curtailed &#8212; the extent to which such rights are restricted is at the discretion of a court &#8212; despite a presumption of innocence. Therefore, the collection of DNA, which is used to fully identify a defendant and expose connections to past criminal acts (for which an individual has no expectation of privacy), serves both the government's and the individual's interests: it assists the government in solving and prosecuting crime and assists the suspect in expediting criminal proceedings. It is the retention of DNA, not its collection, which bespeaks potential government abuse and Orwellian tendencies. Should the defendant be dismissed or acquitted, the DNA sample or profile is destroyed and the privacy interest of the individual restored. While a defendant's conviction would result in retention of his DNA profile, in that instance the defendant's status as a convict already significantly reduces his expectation of privacy. </p>

<p>The real safeguard for individual privacy lies in DNA retention polices, not in the timing of collection, as may be witnessed by the divergence in the policies of the UK and Scotland. Thus, instead of focusing on when DNA is collected, the US should follow the the UK model, which will permit a more precise balancing of the individual and governmental interests. </p>

He writes on why Facebook users are not entitled to constitutional privacy protections...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/farrellmiller.jpeg" height='200' align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he battle between Facebook's business objectives and the public's apprehension over lost privacy is ubiquitous. Facebook rolls out an innovative way to sell users' information and the public tenders its riposte. However, with our focus on this advance and retreat narrative, we must question whether we have lost sight of another important consideration: to what extent does increased Facebook privacy unwittingly protect criminals?</p>

<p>Among the users to benefit from Facebook privacy was 33-year-old serial sex offender Peter Chapman. In 2009, he "friended" 17-year-old Ashleigh Hall on Facebook using a false account that featured a profile picture of a handsome shirtless teen. Chapman messaged Hall and convinced her to meet up. When Chapman arrived to pick her up, he pretended that he was the father of the boy she had corresponded with. Once inside the car, Chapman strangled, raped and murdered Hall. Afterwards, he dumped her naked body in a nearby farmer's field.</p>

<p>While it is impossible to know with certainty, had officials been able to access Facebook information without jumping through legal hoops, Ashleigh Hall might still be alive. Facebook has facilitated &#8212; albeit unwittingly &#8212; sexual harassment, pedophilia, cyber-bullying and murder, among many other crimes, in cases like Hall's and others. Unquestionably, law enforcement officials have a legitimate interest in greater access to Facebook user information in order to save potential victims, stop ongoing criminal activity and to solve and prosecute past crimes. However, the leading interpretation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> privacy law unduly restrains law enforcement officials and leaves the public unprotected from online predators. Currently, if officials need to obtain restricted Facebook information, they must first obtain permission in the form of a warrant. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has held that government action amounts to a Fourth Amendment search if the subject of the alleged search had an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. Because Facebook users do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information published to the site due to the site's overwhelmingly public and social nature, Fourth Amendment privacy rights should not be implicated when officials utilize Facebook information to thwart a crime.</p>

<p>In analyzing whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Court has focused on three main factors: (1) the nature of the place allegedly searched; (2) steps taken to keep the place private; and (3) the amount of intrusion experienced.</p>

<p>Facebook should not be considered a "private place." In Oregon, police did a warrantless thermal scan of a defendant's home to determine if there was an illegal marijuana-growing operation inside. The Supreme Court held in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15840045591115721227">Kyllo v. US</a> that the warrantless scan was a Fourth Amendment search requiring a warrant because it enabled officers to detect what was within the home.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Supreme Court has afforded much less protection to places not within the home. In the case arising out of Kentucky, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3344582850095083654">Oliver v. US</a>, the government trespassed on a resident's field to view a marijuana crop that was otherwise out of sight. The Court held that this action was not a search in part because the open field was so dissimilar to the home. Unlike a home, an open field is neither an "enclave" nor a "setting for those intimate activities that the [Fourth] Amendment is intended to shelter."</p>

<p>Facebook is less like the Oregon resident's home and more like the open field in Kentucky. First, Facebook is unlike a home due to its size alone &#8212; the site has half a billion members. Second, on Facebook privacy norms that one would employ in the home are suspended or ignored. Indeed, the indiscriminant friending phenomenon, which is prevalent on Facebook, has no analogue in the home where entrance is usually strictly proscribed to unknown individuals. Finally, Facebook is a place for sharing; there is an inherent assumption that users intend to publicize their information. Moreover, while users include each other by sharing media, the home's main purpose is to exclude (e.g., inclement weather, intruders, and animals). </p>

<p>Furthermore, steps taken to keep a place private are not always enough to garner constitutional protection. In another California case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13894501388713609672">US v. Ciraolo</a>, an industrious marijuana gardener built two opaque fences to shield his plants from the intruding eye. Police officers requisitioned an airplane and flew over the property in order to take pictures of the grow operation. According to the Supreme Court, because the marijuana could be viewed "publicly" &#8212; from navigable airspace &#8212; the landowner had no expectation of privacy, and accordingly no Fourth Amendment search had occurred. Like the California landowner, Facebook users may erect barriers to viewing, but they are still showing their information to some portion of the public, even if it is just their "friends."</p>

<p>Even assuming a restricted network, online content is subject to false friends. In 2010, using the military's secure SIPRnet, Pfc. Bradley Manning <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">turned over 260,000 classified State Department cables</a> to the website <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a>. If the most sophisticated military in the world is unable to keep its users from sharing classified cables, why should Facebook users be entitled to an expectation of privacy? Indeed, there are entire websites, independent of Facebook, where users retransmit funny or embarrassing Facebook posts. Moreover, Facebook's privacy policy explicitly countenances this type of action in stating: "you understand that information may be re-shared or copied by other users."</p>

<p>Because Facebook is an inherently public medium, government action in that realm is not overly intrusive. In one <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">recent Supreme Court case</a>, a government employee, using his employer-issued pager for personal messages, surpassed the allotted text messages, prompting the employer to perform an audit. The Supreme Court noted that the audit was not overly intrusive because the defendant could have easily opted for a more private way to communicate. Similarly, Facebook users have many other options of communicating over the Internet; however, they affirmatively choose to use a service that is much less private than email for instance. </p>

<p>The scene is not hard to imagine: tweens from across the country posting status updates from the steps of the Supreme Court: "Keep your hands of my Facebook!" However, we must be vigilant less an important part of the Facebook narrative &#8212; privacy measures unwittingly aiding criminals &#8212; will remain completely hidden. <br />

These protests have resulted in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">overthrow</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">death</a> of Muammar Gaddafi, along with the rulers of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egypt</a> being ousted, and those of <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">Bahrain</a>, Jordan, Oman, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">Yemen</a> and Iran being seriously challenged.</p>

<p>Since January, these protests have challenged the legitimacy of leaders in the Middle East and North Africa. US allies and adversaries have experienced intense public unrest challenging their rule and legal systems. That has taken place due to a twenty-first century manifesto of small changes, enabled by technology, to mobilize those nations' youth against dictatorial regimes. This was not entirely anticipated. Malcolm Gladwell cast doubt on the potential contribution of social networking to social movements and social change. Gladwell concluded in his October 4, 2010 article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell">Small Change: Why the Revolution Will Not Be Tweeted</a>, in <em>The New Yorker</em> that social networking websites with weak ties and unstructured equality among participants are the opposite of the US civil rights movement's strong ties and hierarchical organizations.</p>

<p>Jeremy Brecher and Brendan Smith countered Gladwell with the October 8, 2011 piece <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brendan-smith/social-networking-is-malc_b_753274.html">Is Social Networking Useless for Social Change?</a> in The Huffington Post. The authors considered Gladwell out of touch with true changes in political organizing and communication. Brecher and Smith cited to a "once-influential study published in 1847 [that] observed that workers were beginning to form 'combinations'" via the use of electronic (telegraph) and print (newspaper) means of communication. In a profound understatement, the authors commented that "[m]aybe the role of telegraph and newspapers a century and two-thirds ago is irrelevant to the role of social networking media today. But maybe not."</p>

<p>That study was in fact the 1848 <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/">Manifesto of the Communist Party</a> by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marx and Engels observed that workers were beginning to form "combinations" and that this "union [was] helped on by the improved means of communication that are created by Modern Industry, and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes."</p>

<p>Current events raise some provocative questions on the utility of social networking to revolution. Namely: are "improved means of communications" now creating a "contact ... needed to centralize the numerous local struggles ... into one national struggle" between governments and their people? Are corrupt party politics and bankrupt slogans being put into perspective of real-world experiences shared in real-time? Put as a positive assertion, modern-day Internet revolutionaries may be unconsciously &#8212; or consciously &#8212; following those tenets set forth in the Manifesto, even without embracing Marxism.</p>

<p>What may prove to be one of America's most infamous security breaches may also be looked upon as the impetus for some recently emergent Internet-based movements for freedom of speech and civil liberties. Specifically, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told reporters recently that leaked US diplomatic cables in December 2010 showed former Tunisian president Ben Ali to be corrupt and would not have US support if revolution came to his nation. That news became known to thousands of technologically savvy young Tunisians who were weary of the persistent political illegitimacy of the Ben Ali government. This knowledge mobilized them to act to bring his government down. Weeks later, the world witnessed this again in Egypt, with president Hosni Mubarak stepping down after 30 years in power and now facing <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-suspended-after-former-ally-testifies.php">public trial</a>.  Muammar Gaddafi, the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution" in Libya, has been chased from his palaces in Tripoli and met his demise at the hands of his own people as facilitated by NATO air support. Social networking-enabled challenges to authority have also spurred on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/iran-opposition-leader-under-house-arrest-after-calling-for-egypt-style-protests.php">resurgence of resistance</a> to the theocratic regime in Iran.</p>

<p>This paradigm of progress challenges the antiquated agents of change, those nineteenth and twentieth century notions in which peoples and nations might reestablish political legitimacy around the globe. Nineteenth century German political scientist Heinrich Rudolf Hermann Friedrich von Gneist considered the "free legal profession" as an "Archimedean lever for accomplishing the liberal project of personal rights and the rule of law." That profession is still significant, to be sure, but interpersonal communications have become an increasingly important lever to move ideas and regimes.</p>

		<title>Prosecuting Gaddafi: Ensuring Justice in Libya</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Charles Adeogun-Phillips of <a href="http://www.charlesanthonylaw.com/">Charles Anthony LLP</a> says that despite concerns surrounding the ability of the new Libyan government to provide Muammar Gaddafi with a fair trial upon capture, it should be allowed the opportunity to establish a hybrid international and domestic court for the purposes of institution building and reconciliation...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/charlesadeogunphillips.jpeg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>rom all indications, it would seem as though the 42-year reign of Libyan leader and Pan African activist Colonel Muammar Gaddafi is finally over. Like <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=saddam">Saddam Hussein</a>, his ego is bound to get the better of him, and he will mostly likely remain on Libyan soil until he is captured by rebel forces. That is not necessarily a bad thing. </p>

<p>At a minimum, it is clear that the preferred choice of the National Transitional Council (NTC) is that Gaddafi be tried at home on account of the fact that he presided over the brutal slaughter of Libyan civilians during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">recent uprising</a>. It may well be that, in an attempt to reflect the totality of Gaddafi's alleged criminal conduct, the NTC may decide that he face trial on international terrorism charges in connection with the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland 23 years ago. Many international commentators have objected to this view on the premise that it is inconceivable that Gaddafi could receive justice at the hands of those whom he has repressed for so long. Consequently, they have argued that his fate should be left to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=icc">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) at The Hague. </p>

<p>Notable among those clamoring for a trial in the ICC is a leading international human rights lawyer and former president of the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, Geoffrey Robertson. In recent articles in <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/libya-needs-the-hague-not-a-local-show-trial-20110825-1jcbw.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/aug/28/gaddafi-hague-cameron-wrong-trial">Guardian</a>, he argues that as a matter of principle, the fate of the Gaddafis must not be left to Libyans. In that regard, Robertson identifies the massacre of 1,200 captives in a prison compound, the killing of 270 people in the Lockerbie bombing and almost as many in a passenger jet over Chad a few months later, as "the most egregious examples of Gaddafi's international crimes." He argues that it is essential for "Gaddafi [to] face justice in The Hague, not in Benghazi." </p>

<p>I am a little surprised and perhaps even more confused by Robertson's arguments in this regard, considering that the ICC does not have retrospective jurisdiction and is therefore unable to try Gaddafi for these particular crimes. All crimes within the jurisdiction of that court must have occurred after the entry into force of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> on July 1, 2002. This is one key feature of proceedings before the ICC. That being the case, even with its best efforts, the ICC will be unable to try Gaddafi for these events. </p>

<p>Apart from lacking the temporal jurisdiction to try Gaddafi for these crimes, the ICC also lacks subject matter jurisdiction, at least so far as the Lockerbie and Chad bombings are concerned. These were acts of terrorism committed without any connection to an armed conflict and as such are outside the jurisdiction of the Rome Statute, even though they constitute international crimes. I fail to understand the logic in Robertson's suggestion that a court, which obviously lacks jurisdiction, provides Libyans with an appropriate forum to try Gaddafi for these crimes. Astonishingly, and still in favor of The Hague, Robertson argues that the fact that "liberation has come to the Libyans courtesy of international law, they have a reciprocal duty to abide by it." As evidence of this, Robertson cites the <a href="/forum/unresolution1970.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 1970</a> [PDF] of February 2011, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">referred the situation in Libya to the ICC</a>, and which has led to charges being <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">filed</a> by the ICC prosecutor against Muammar Gaddafi, his son, Saif al-Islam and Abdullah al-Senussi by the said court. </p>

<p>However, a close examination of UN Security Council Resolution 1970 will reveal that it has nothing whatsoever to do with either the Lockerbie or Chad bombings. In fact, ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo has not indicted the Gaddafis for any of these crimes because he is quite simply barred by statute, thus raising one of the most unique and fascinating aspects of international criminal law. In that regard, although there is no statute of limitation for the prosecution of international crimes, several of the international penal institutions where such crimes can be prosecuted are often of limited temporal and subject matter jurisdiction. Such is the case here. </p>

<p>So, if the ICC prosecutor is statute barred from prosecuting Gaddafi at least in connection with the Lockerbie bombing, he is in effect devoid of the ability to reflect the totality of Gaddafi's alleged criminal conduct in court, especially as this particular crime was "international" in all its ramifications. That cannot be the right approach to seeking justice for both Libyans and the international community at large.</p>

<p>Robertson further cites <a href="/forum/unresolution1973.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 1973</a> mandating NATO's action in Libya to protect civilian lives, and concludes that no one can pretend that Gaddafi's regime could have been overthrown without the air, sea and logistical support provided by NATO forces. To be fair, he is not the only one that shares this view. It is the collective opinion of many in the "West." However, he likens it to a "duty" under international law, and that is what I have a problem with. </p>

<p>Having totally confused the temporal and subject matter jurisdiction of the ICC in relation to the events outlined above, I trust this renowned British human rights lawyer is not now suggesting that the Libyan people owe the super powers in control of NATO, immense gratitude for their "intervention" in saving the people of Libya and that the time has come for some sort of "payback," after all, as the saying goes, nothing goes for nothing. In all my years of practice as a distinguished member of the international bar, I have never come across such a notion under public international law &#8212; namely, one which imposes on a sovereign state, a "reciprocal duty to abide by international law." Does Robertson suggest yet another extension to the draft Article on the Doctrine of State Responsibility as proposed by the International Law Commission? </p>

<p>One might be forgiven to assume that as a member of the UN, Libya and its people are entitled to some measure of protection from the international community against obvious and sustained human rights abuses without the need to reciprocate. After all, does the UN Security Council not have a conventional obligation to maintain peace and security in all countries of the world? Anyone who reads the text of Resolution 1970 would find that it does. Assuming that such a duty exists, in fact and in law, the question then arises: does the forum for the exercise of that duty have to occur outside of Libya? I would think not.</p>

<p>In any event, contrary to Robertson's view, assuming by a long-shot that both the subject matter and temporal jurisdictional issues are in place in relation to the crimes outlined in his paper, Resolution 1970, cannot in itself, confer jurisdiction on the ICC regarding the situation in Libya. This is yet another misapprehension that Robertson labors under. Another major feature of the Rome Statute is that the judicial activity of the ICC is intended only to compliment that of national courts. Consequently, the ICC can exercise its jurisdiction only when national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out investigations and the prosecution of persons accused of international crimes defined in the Rome Statute &#8212; namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. </p>

<p>Therefore, although the UN Security Council, acting under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII of the UN Charter</a>, can require the ICC prosecutor to commence an investigation and report back to it accordingly, such investigative activity merely compliments that of the state in question and cannot have precedence over it. It is only when a state is found to be unable or unwilling to prosecute these crimes that the jurisdiction of the ICC is triggered. The question is this: has the National Transitional Council (NTC), described by Robertson as "a gimcrack organization," been afforded the opportunity to determine whether or not it has the ability to prosecute the Gaddafis for these crimes? Should they in fact be afforded such an opportunity? Certainly, Robertson, who sees the NTC as nothing but "showy and useless," (the oxford dictionary definition of the word gimcrack) cannot think so. </p>

<p>Surely, the NTC's stated preference for prosecuting Muammar Gaddafi and his son, Saif al-Islam, among others, on Libyan soil must speak for the majority of Libyans. In any event, even if they wanted to, the NTC cannot refer the terrorist acts alluded to by Robertson to the ICC, but can only do so in relation to the crimes committed against the Libyan people during the recent uprising in February 2011. </p>

<p>The NTC's position has received the support of UK Prime Minister David Cameron and other notable international figures. In reaction, Robertson describes Cameron's position as a "serious mistake" and likens it with that which "George Bush took after the capture of Saddam Hussein, which as far as he is concerned, was a rhetorical cover to ensure that the death penalty could be imposed on Hussein by politically manipulated local judges." The suggestion that it is impossible to receive a "fair" trial when charged with serious international crimes unless one is spirited off to The Hague must be incorrect. Certainly, a trial at the ICC for international crimes cannot be the only option open to the NTC, even if one were to be persuaded by Robertson's apparent disregard for the African and Middle Eastern judiciary, where, according to him, local judges can be politically manipulated. Even if it were so, is this the kind of statement one would expect from a distinguished jurist who once presided over the affairs of a UN-backed court situated on the African continent? </p>

<p>Leaving Robertson's short-sighted and myopic views aside for a moment, if anything, it has to be important to the international community that justice not only be done in Libya, but that it is done to the satisfaction of Libyans. This cannot be fully achieved at The Hague. Instead, the people of Libya need a forum that can allow them the flexibility of presenting the totality of Gaddafi's alleged criminal conduct during his 42-year reign of terror on his people and the international community at large. The ICC cannot afford them that opportunity. </p>

<p>Even in relation to the crimes for which the ICC has jurisdiction, the Libyan people, through the NTC, have not been afforded the opportunity to demonstrate their inability and/or unwillingness to prosecute the Gaddafis. On the contrary, they have said that they are able and willing to do so and that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, puts to rest any discussions of an ICC prosecution, at least for now. Rather than lean towards an ICC prosecution for Gaddafi and his co-perpetrators, it is important at this crucial stage that the NTC receives unbiased counsel as to the various options available to seek and achieve justice for the heinous crimes committed by Gaddafi and his loyalists during the uprising with a view to securing lasting reconciliation amongst the Libyan population. </p>

<p>In that regard, there are several proven scenarios and models of international justice that can be utilized by the NTC to prosecute a range of international crimes committed within and outside Libya and ensure the fairness of the trial process. It is only after these avenues have been considered and exhausted that the issue of trials at The Hague can be entertained. Such proven scenarios consist of the establishment of a hybrid court, which can either be in the form of a domesticated international court, or an internationalized domestic court. With either model, the jurisdiction of such hybrid courts will be not be limited in time as they can try cases dating back several years, as there is no statute of limitation for international crimes. Such courts will ideally be composed of both local and international prosecutors and judges, such as was the case in the Special Panels of the Dili District Court in East Timor in 2000; the panels in the courts of Kosovo in 2001; the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Special+Court+for+Sierra+Leone">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL) in 2002; the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eccc">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) in 2006; and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Special+Tribunal+for+Lebanon">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) in 2009.</p>

<p>Flexibility and customizability are perhaps the greatest assets of hybrid criminal tribunals and special courts as there is virtually no situation that a hybrid tribunal or court cannot accommodate. It is this customized legal and judicial flexibility that the Libyan people require at this time and there is no reason why they cannot have it. Apart from the fact that these types of special courts are ad hoc in nature, they can operate utilizing a distinctive blend of both domestic and international substantive and procedural laws and rules derived from common and civil law jurisdictions. For example, in the case of the STL, the procedural rules are international in nature, but its applicable substantive law is derived from the Lebanese Criminal Code. In contrast, the procedure at the ECCC is based on Cambodian criminal procedure and its substantive law is, for the most part, international in character. Any one of these options is open to the NTC and the Libyan people in consultation with international experts. </p>

<p>It has also been possible for states who still operate the death penalty to remove or suspend those provisions in relation to the prosecution of international crimes. This was done in Rwanda to allow for the transfer of cases from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ictr">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) as part of the completion strategy, which required the transfer of cases from the UN court to Rwanda, among others. Therefore, there is no justification in the argument that the existence of the death penalty in Libya would impact on the ability of defendants to be guaranteed a fair hearing. </p>

<p>Those of us who were fortunate enough to have been involved in the pioneering work of the first two ad hoc international tribunals established since the Nuremberg trials have, with the benefit of hindsight, discovered that the hybrid as opposed to solely international courts can be more efficient and better situated for prosecuting international crimes following large scale atrocities. We have also found that the inquisitorial rather than adversarial approach may be better suited to prosecute such offences. Robertson has not taken these factors into consideration. </p>

<p>In that regard, it is the full participation of nationals from the affected countries that clearly sets the hybrid criminal tribunals apart from all other international criminal forums. Concerns as to the fairness of the judiciary are often balanced with the appointment of at least one local judge to a bench of three judges. Likewise, prosecutors, investigators and registrars at such courts are often drawn from both local and international personnel, thus providing locals with a stake in the process and at the same time building human capacity in the relevant state. </p>

<p>In terms of subject matter jurisdiction, it is only a hybrid international court that can conduct a trial for events such as the Lockerbie bombing. In addition, a hybrid court can utilize existing legal and investigative talent within Libya to achieve the efficient investigation and prosecution of the Gaddafis for their crimes. After all, they know their territory better than any foreigner does. A customized hybrid court will be cheaper, more focused, efficient and would create a much needed local capacity. The activities of such a court will be documented and archived locally for successive generations. This court could not only prosecute international crimes in Libya, but also bolster the existing national judicial system and the rule of law.</p>

<p>In contrast, solely international courts tend to be staffed along the lines of the UN General Assembly. More often than not, the focus during the recruitment of personnel is on adequate representation of UN member states, as opposed to efficiency. Libyan citizens will play a peripheral role, if any, in the prosecution and investigation of these crimes such as acting as language assistants with little or virtually no visibility, whilst foreign lawyers, investigators, experts and other professionals will play more prominent roles. In any event, because international courts do not have any enforcement powers of their own, the reality on the ground is that international lawyers, investigators and other professionals drawn for all over the world still have to rely heavily on local law enforcement professionals for gaining access to crime scenes, retrieving and collecting evidence and even protecting witnesses. To that end, practical considerations, such as witness protection issues, the availability of witnesses, gaining access to territory, and safe passage of witnesses can only be guaranteed by the state in whose territory the crimes occurred. </p>

<p>Indeed, one of the major shortcomings of the solely international prosecution is the fact that such institutions are situated outside the country in which the atrocities were committed. It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone experienced in dealing with the victims, witnesses and survivors of large scale atrocities to argue that international forums are better suited to aid national reconciliation than domestic or hybrid ones. In that regard, the ability of victims of large-scale atrocities to follow the trials of the perpetrators of such crimes makes a marked difference in their ability to heal and reconcile. After all, can we legitimately implore victims and survivors of mass crimes to be patient and exercise restraint if we are unable or unwilling to deliver justice to assuage their wounds in a manner that they can relate to? </p>

<p>Placing a hybrid court in the middle of the crime scene was without a doubt a great motivation for the SCSL. The SCSL was the first of the hybrid international tribunals to be situated right within the crime scene, as it were. That allowed the people of Sierra Leone to see justice being done. Robertson presided over the affairs of that court from its inception. Like their counterparts in Cambodia, Sierra Leone and Egypt, Libyans need to share in this experience. International tribunals and courts are created for the victims and not for the desires of the international community. A hybrid international court will leave a lasting legacy for the Libyan people, who will be trained to take over from their international counterparts. It will allow people to know that the rule of law is indeed a more powerful and better option than the rule of the gun. </p>

<p>Having said that, lessons must be learned from past. From the onset, the Libyans must seek expert help in establishing an achievable mandate for the operation of this court. That mandate must be limited and focused on prosecuting only those who bear the greatest responsibility for the crimes charged. The Libyans must be assisted in exercising that prosecutorial discretion, which, if abused, may have far-reaching consequences for the entire region. There must be a prosecutorial plan and that plan must be realistic and achievable. Such a plan must include a comprehensive trial strategy, which must involve prosecutors and investigators working in tandem. Investigations must be conducted into possible sexual offences against women and children where relevant, and concrete mechanisms must be established to seek, protect and relocate witnesses. There should be no more than a handful of indictments issued, perhaps no more than a dozen. An exit strategy must be established right at the beginning, as the work of any international tribunal or court must be limited in time, and efforts must be made to keep to that time frame. Funding commitments should be secured well in advance of the court's creation. </p>

<p>Of course, solely international courts and tribunals have the unique advantage of being located away from the country where the crimes occurred. That sometimes can be an invaluable tool depending on the nature of the conflict and the actors involved. There have been several situations where for political reasons and ongoing conflicts, it has been practically impossible to prosecute international crimes in the country were the crimes occurred. Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia are recent examples. </p>

<p>The recent ICC investigation of the situation in Kenya following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election">post-election violence of December 2007</a> is yet another example of such a situation. Similarly, the relocation of the Charles Taylor trial from Freetown to The Hague was necessary for security reasons, provides another example of the flexibility of hybrid courts. The STL, established to prosecute those responsible for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, also hybrid in nature, sits in Leidschendam, just outside The Hague. The ongoing political divisions in Beirut and neighboring Damascus made it impossible to establish that court within Lebanon. </p>

<p>It may well be that the trial of the Gaddafis may follow this pattern if and when such a situation presents itself. It is, however, premature at this stage to dismiss the possibility of conducting their trials in Benghazi. Whichever system of justice is employed by the NTC, it must be emphasized that no system of international criminal justice can succeed without the fullest international support and cooperation. </p>

<p>With neighboring Egypt and Tunisia embroiled in their own post-conflict matters; Algeria playing host to and providing protective refuge to Gaddafi's immediate and extended family; South Africa undecided as to its position on the NTC and in the absence of consensus within the African Union (AU) (Nigeria, having publicly declared support for the NTC), the AU must seize the moment and take more decisive, robust and bold steps towards playing a more significant role in post-conflict Libya. Insisting on Libyans try the Gaddafis on Libyan soil will be a step in that direction. It is a step that will serve to ensure the creation of enduring judicial institutions, and promote and enhance fair trial values on the continent of Africa. </p>

<p>The best-case scenario must be for African tyrants to face trial before their people. It is only then that we can truly talk of reconciliation through justice. Justice must not only be done in Libya, but must be seen by all Libyans to be done.</p>

Montana</em>, the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana and the National ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">sued on behalf of six same-sex couples</a> seeking legal recognition of their long-term committed relationships. Montanans had amended the <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/Constition.htm">Montana Constitution</a> to define marriage as between a man and a woman, but that amendment does not prevent analyzing the claims under either the equal protection or privacy clauses of the state constitution.</p>

                <p>The suit explains that the statutory scheme granting protections, obligations and benefits to one set of couples (opposite sex couples who can marry) but excluding a similarly situated set of couples (committed same-sex couples who cannot marry) violates equal protection and privacy rights under the Montana Constitution. Strict scrutiny should be applied to that statutory scheme, and there is no compelling state interest supporting this discrimination.</p>

                <p>With respect to the privacy claim, the right to choose a life partner and protect a family relationship is integral to the express right of privacy contained in the Montana Constitution. That right of privacy includes the right to substantive protections which, at the very least, require the state take some affirmative action to acknowledge and support the domestic partnership or family unit. The express right of privacy, coupled with the right to human dignity provision in the Montana Constitution, forms the basis for legal recognition of same-sex couples who are similarly situated to married couples.</p>

                <p>Along with these progressive state constitutional provisions, Montana has a history of recognizing that same-sex relationships are entitled to a modicum of protection under the equal protection and privacy clauses. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7401990473637058467">Gryczan v. Montana</a>, the Montana Supreme Court invalidated the state's sodomy law six years before the US Supreme Court invalidated a similar Texas law in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a>. In <em>Gryczan</em>, the Montana Supreme Court recognized the expansive protections of Article II, &#167; 10 of the Montana Constitution, which states that the "right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest." Because the right of privacy is explicit, it afforded greater protections than those provided under the US Constitution. The <em>Gryczan</em> Court held the statute criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct violated the personal autonomy component of this fundamental privacy right.</p>

                <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14890094579430352920">Snetsinger v. Montana University System</a>, the Montana Supreme Court reviewed a university policy that allowed opposite-sex unmarried couples to have health insurance coverage, but denied same-sex unmarried couples such coverage. The Court held that the policy violated the state's Equal Protection Clause. Most recently, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15650349292070156665">Kulstad v. Maniaci</a>, the Court reviewed the state third-party parenting statute that allows someone other than the adoptive or natural parents to establish a parental interest with the child. A lesbian couple had adopted two small children, but only one had her name on the adoption certificate. The Court affirmed the constitutionality of the statute, recognizing the parental interest in the non-adoptive parent.</p>

                <p>With these foundational cases, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed suit</a> in state district court on behalf of six same-sex couples, each in long-term committed relationship and willing to enter into a domestic partnership arrangement if it were provided by the state of Montana. We argued that the provision in the state constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman could not be construed to limit the equal protection and privacy clauses, and therefore was restricted to only sanctioning the designation of marriage. The state trial court dismissed the case, however, focusing on one of the remedies that was requested &#8212; an order to the state of Montana to offer the same-sex couples a legal status through a domestic partnership scheme. The trial court held that such an order violated separation of powers principles, and while the marriage amendment would not preclude challenges to individual statutes, it bolstered the court's reluctance to engage in a broad review of the statutory scheme. </p>

                <p>The case is currently on <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-appeals-same-sex-domestic-partnership-case-to-montana-high-court.php">appeal to the Montana Supreme Court</a>, with briefing to be done this fall. The Court should continue its recognition of the protections afforded all Montanans under its state constitution and determine that it can provide relief for the ongoing injuries experienced by same-sex couples in Montana.</p>

Aphra Behn, <em>The Rover</em></p>

<p>As the beating heart of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) created by the 1992 <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/treaties_maastricht_en.htm">Maastricht Treaty</a>, the EU has "irrevocably" fixed &#8212; at least according to the EU treaties &#8212; the rate at which the euro has been substituted for seventeen qualifying national currencies. However, the upcoming tenth anniversary celebrations for the introduction of the actual euro banknotes and coins on January 1, 2002, have now turned gloomy. The lingering effects of the global financial crisis, plus slow economic growth in comparison to major competitor nations and blocs, have led the EU into what resembles a dead end road. Now, on top of all this economic gloom, comes the mother of all economic crises: the insolvency of certain eurozone nations. In strict legal terms, this sovereign debt crisis should not be happening in the eurozone, but it is happening, and its increasing whirlwind may just lead to the unthinkable &#8212; the withdrawal from the eurozone of certain debt-impaired members. The question then becomes whether such actions legally possible. If possible, what would be the major legal effects upon the repayment of euro-denominated obligations by the departing eurozone member governments and by private parties?</p>

<p><strong>A Legal as Well as Political Failure</strong> </p>

<p>The current eurozone sovereign debt crisis stems from a legal as well as political failure, namely, the lack of enforcement of the EU's famous <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/stability_and_growth_pact/l25021_en.htm">1997 Stability and Growth Pact</a>. This legally binding agreement between eurozone members imposed strict limits on national deficits at no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and debt at no more than 60 percent of GDP, in addition to European Commission supervision and possible sanctions against violating nations. Unfortunately for Europe's new currency, these legal constraints turned out not to be very strict after all. Not only was the pact not enforced against Greece for repeated and serious violations, but the sanctity of the pact was brought into question by the refusal of both Germany and France to adhere to the agreed limits. In a surprising decision, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled against the EU Council for its refusal to pursue the pact's enforcement against these two "EU Pillars" when they exceeded the agreed limits on deficits. Thus, the rule of law within the EU pertaining to national finances was seriously undermined by the very nations now called upon to straighten out the eurozone mess. One must mention that recent EU legislation provides for stricter enforcement of the pact's fiscal constraints, but only time will tell whether EU institutions have the will to implement these rules in a consistent and effective manner. Accordingly, with the crisis upon them, EU nations are now reaping the harvest that they themselves have sown.</p>

<p><strong>Consequences of this Legal Failure</strong></p>

<p>Confronted with the escalating European sovereign debt crisis, the governments of Germany and France now find themselves between a rock and a hard place. Bailing out Greece, Ireland and Portugal from their sovereign debt morass is one thing, but the prospect of an EU rescue of Italy and Spain &#8212; respectively the third and fourth largest eurozone economies &#8212; is another. If the experts are to be believed, it must be assumed that these major economies will require staggering amounts of financial support from other eurozone members, other EU members and, most likely, the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The so-called "Franco-German Axis" is clearly up against the wall in this extraordinary situation as lenders of last resort. Whether done through the current <a href="http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm">European Financial Stability Facility</a> (EFSF) &#8212; with a proposed lending capacity of &#8364;440 billion plus maximum guarantee commitments of &#8364;780 billion &#8212; or the successor entity called the European Stability Mechanism, the amount of eurozone member state support required to even begin to resolve this sovereign debt debacle is truly staggering and may well exceed the trillion euro mark. Of course, the bulk of this lending is to be guaranteed by Germany (27 percent) and France (20 percent).  However, recent reports suggest that France itself is under threat of a credit rating downgrade in light of its ballooning debt &#8212; an action which could seriously jeopardize the "AAA" rating currently enjoyed by the EFSF when floating its bonds.  </p>

<p>This leads to some interesting options for EU leaders. They can either allow the eurozone's debt-impaired nations to work out a structured default (as with Greece) and suffer the consequences for the euro exchange rate and economic stability, or they can suffer the exit of one or more eurozone members. While the first option can be assumed to be more palatable for eurozone members, as evidenced by the recent structured default in Greece, these leaders are realistic enough to understand that the affected nations will require at least a decade to extricate themselves from the enormous debt overhang and its debilitating effects upon their national economies. Therefore, one must ask whether the other eurozone members really prepared to remain bogged down by such an economic ball and chain for such an extended period of time. Will the other eurozone members have the patience to await a rebound in productivity and competitiveness in the "laggards" &#8212; something not so easily accomplished without the ability to devalue a national currency? Accordingly, the other option &#8212; the withdrawal or temporary suspension of debt-impaired members from the euro currency system &#8212; may well be attractive under such dire straits. This possibility is routinely referred to by EU scholars as "thinking the unthinkable," but is it really? Further, if it is thinkable under the current extreme circumstances, is it legally possible?</p>

<p><strong>A Legal Path for Exiting the Euro</strong>  </p>

<p>While there exists no specific EU law providing for the orderly withdrawal from the EMU and euro, EU law does provide, by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:EN:PDF">by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union</a> [PDF], for the withdrawal of a member state from the EU itself. This provision, added by the <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/full_text/index_en.htm">Lisbon Treaty</a>, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/treaty-of-lisbon-enters-into-force.php">adopted</a> in December 2009, provides the right of EU member states to notify the EU Council of their desire to withdraw from the union without any preconditions. The withdrawal shall be effective two years from the date of notification or from the date of agreement with the council concerning continuing relations between the exiting member state and remaining union. Surprisingly, this provision does not specifically mention the necessary accord of the European Central Bank (ECB) for eurozone members wishing to withdraw. Thus, a departing member state could legally withdraw in two years and one day without any specific agreement concerning ECB-governed currency issues. Practically speaking, however, a concerned member state would most likely pay very close attention to details pertaining to the return of capital contributions and reimbursement of foreign reserve holdings by the ECB. Therefore, complex and perhaps contentious withdrawal negotiations with EU institutions &#8212; and in particular, the ECB &#8212; seem to be a given for any exiting member state.<br />
 <br />
While this option may seem somewhat far-fetched, it should be noted that the ECB has itself undertaken preliminary studies of the modalities and, most importantly, legality of EMU and euro withdrawal. In a 2009 study entitled "<a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp10.pdf">Withdrawal and Expulsion from the EU and EMU: Some Reflections,</a>" the ECB legal staff stated its well considered opinion (although not binding as official policy), that while EU withdrawal would be legal under the explicit terms provided by the Lisbon Treaty, the unilateral withdrawal from the EMU and euro (i.e., without a negotiated agreement with the EU institutions) without simultaneous EU membership withdrawal would be illegal. Thus, a stand-alone withdrawal from the EMU and euro would be legally impossible, as it would be in direct defiance of the "irreversibility" of European EMU. Concerning a much more contentious issue, the ECB staff opined that EU law does not provide for the expulsion of EU members from the union itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Legal Effects of Euro Withdrawal</strong></p>

<p>Clearly, the process of withdrawal from the EMU and the euro currency by a eurozone member is fraught with legal difficulties. These difficulties, however, pale in comparison to the legal quagmire which will ensue concerning the currency of payment for obligations involving both the government and private parties located within the withdrawn state. Will these payments be made in the new currency of the withdrawn nation at some statutorily fixed conversion rate, or will they be required to be made in the former currency? This problem becomes all the more important due to the fact that the euro would still exist after the withdrawal of a current eurozone member state. While the withdrawal from a supranational entity such as the EU and its currency union presents unprecedented legal issues, especially in a world of public international law focused upon the actions of "nation-states," several basic principles contained in the body of the "law of money" can provide some navigational aids for these rather uncharted waters.<br />
 <br />
Our first legal principle, referred to as <em>lex monetae</em>, or "state theory of money," provides that the law of the nation of the currency in which the debt is expressed shall decide what constitutes the currency. Although the euro is, legally speaking, the currency of the EU, it is also the legal tender of each individual eurozone member. Accordingly, pursuant to the <em>lex monetae</em> principle, an EU nation is free to exercise its sovereign powers to substitute a new national currency for the euro currency and to then, by national law, establish a conversion rate for the exchange of former euro obligations into the new national currency.</p>

<p>While the exercise of this sovereign right may be considered as perfectly legal under the withdrawing state's constitutional structure, such action may very well breach EU treaty provisions, and thus be considered by other member states as a violation of EU law and international obligations if carried out unilaterally.<br />
 <br />
Second, the "continuity of contracts principle" &#8212; which is widely followed throughout the world's major legal systems &#8212; would ensure that both domestic and international contracts expressed in the euro would remain valid and enforceable even though the euro may no longer be the legal tender of the obligor under the contract. Assuming that the new currency unit is considered as a "reasonable substitute performance" for the original euro payment provision, this legal principle would, in effect, thwart the classic defenses to contract enforcement such as "impossibility of performance," "frustration of contract" and "commercial impracticability," which might be posited by disgruntled parties. This continuity of contracts principle was in fact imposed upon all EU member states as a matter of law during the introduction of the euro currency. Most nations (and US states) applied this provision within their own legal systems in order to provide stability during the euro transition.<br />
    <br />
Third, the law applicable to the contract transaction involving withdrawn country obligations (whether private or public) will be key in determining the currency of payment thereunder. The currency of payment and conversion rules for so-called "domestic contracts" within the exiting euro member state &#8212; involving local parties and clearly subject to the withdrawing nation's law &#8212; would, in application of the <em>lex monetae</em> principle, be submitted to that nation's new currency laws. Most government debt issues are made subject to the debtor nation's laws; thus, it may be assumed that the currency payment situation is clear for such contracts. This is especially true where the parties are located in the withdrawn state and payment is to be effectuated in that nation. However, the situation becomes much less clear for contracts with an international dimension, whether concerning sovereign or private obligations. For contracts involving foreign parties and foreign law clauses entered into outside of the withdrawn nation and calling for payment outside of that nation, it is most likely that foreign courts would strictly apply the euro payment called for in such contracts. This is the case since the euro will still legally exist and, as expressed by several legal scholars, EU law concerning the euro may itself constitute the <em>lex monetae</em> of such "international contracts" denominated in euros. In all events, choice of law clauses and/or conflict of law determinations as to the applicable law will be central to outcomes concerning currency of payment in such situations.  </p>

<p><strong>A Negotiated Legal Framework for Withdrawal from the Euro</strong>  </p>

<p>Assuming the EU authorities stick within a strict interpretation of treaty law provisions &#8212; prohibiting EMU and euro withdrawal without simultaneously exiting the EU &#8212; it appears absolutely necessary, for obvious political, economic and legal reasons, to provide all concerned with a solid and negotiated exit plan. Thus, this circles back to the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty which added the right of withdrawal from the EU subject to negotiations with the EU Council concerning post-withdrawal relations. Although, as previously mentioned, the withdrawing member may quit the EU without reaching any negotiated agreement with the council, it seems more realistic to assume that the withdrawing nation itself will be highly interested in establishing the most stable economic and monetary environment possible under such destabilizing circumstances. Therefore, the EU and withdrawing member state would have the opportunity to jointly fix &#8212; as a matter of EU and national law &#8212; the modalities of withdrawal. Though not mentioned in the Lisbon Treaty's withdrawal clause, the ECB would, by necessity, play the leading role in these negotiations. Accordingly, the EU, ECB and departing member state may well be able to fix a negotiated euro conversion rate for the new national currency and impose it within all remaining member states. The more contentious issue (assuming that such could even be considered by the EU authorities) would be the decision concerning the currency of payment for what might be defined as "international contracts" compared to purely "domestic contracts" &#8212; at least within the remaining EU. The question remains as to which contracts will be payable in the still existing euro currency, and which will be payable in the new national currency of the departing member state. </p>

<p>Another possibility discussed within would be for the EU to amend existing law to legally permit debt-impaired eurozone nations, so-called "peripheral zone nations," to remain within the union following a very radical adjustment of the EMU system. This plan would create a two currency system, allowing the peripheral eurozone members facing insolvency and unable to regain economic competitiveness to adopt a weaker currency for their respective economies &#8212; with the exchange rate for the euro and the weaker currency fixed by EU authorities. A similar arrangement was used during the transition period for the euro currency. These two currencies would then be managed by the ECB, with the weaker euro nation subject to tight oversight of economic and fiscal fundamentals to allow the return to a single currency as soon as economically and fiscally possible.   </p>

<p>Regardless of which negotiated option is chosen, this dual legal approach would help to avoid substantial conflict in the event foreign courts should rule that the <em>lex monetae</em> of any particular obligation remained EU law and not that of the re-denominating nation. Such a coordinated approach would go a long way in providing some degree of legal certainty during what would necessarily be a terribly uncertain economic situation.</p>

<p>Finally, none of this euro exit planning will be necessary should European leaders somehow find a way to quickly harmonize economic and fiscal policies to regain eurozone stability. However, if these leaders fail to do so within the near future, there remains the distinct possibility that the "unthinkable" could happen. If so, better to have a well-conceived euro exit plan in place to help smooth over what will be very choppy waters.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leonard Forsman, Chairman of the <a href="http://www.suquamish.org/">Suquamish Tribe</a>, says that the tribe's decision to recognize same-sex marriage reflects the community's high value on inclusiveness and the fact that homosexuality historically has not been a divisive issue in the tribe...<br><hr height="1"><br><strong>L</strong>ast month, the Suquamish Tribal Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/american-indian-tribe-adopts-law-recognizing-same-sex-marriage.php">amended</a> its existing Marriage and Divorce Ordinance to permit marriages regardless of the couple's gender. The amendment passed by a unanimous vote of the council and allows same-sex couples to receive the same treatment and benefits as opposite-sex couples. At least one person entering the marriage must be an enrolled member of the Suquamish Tribe. The amendment also provides for tribe members in civil unions entered in recognized jurisdictions to convert the union into a Suquamish Tribal marriage.</p>

                <p>The issue of sexual orientation is not controversial in the Suquamish community. I have found no mention of sexual orientation as an issue in my research of the Tribe's oral history or in non-Indian archival data. Some elders have stated that traditional views on same-sex interactions suggested that these individuals may have possessed unique spiritual associations. Research indicates that sexual orientation was probably not an area of great moral concern or discussion in Suquamish society before interaction with non-Indians. That same cultural value remains within the community today.</p>

                <p>This tribal community of 1,050 members is sensitive to discrimination. Many members have experienced mistreatment based on race in their own lifetime, so the council understands the importance of ensuring that tribe members do not face discrimination in their own tribal laws, including due to sexual orientation. Tribe members view the amendment as an expression of the high value they place on inclusiveness and acceptance of diverse views within our community. This amendment embodies the Suquamish people's ultimate exercise of its inherent right as a sovereign government to address the essential social question of whom Suquamish Tribe members can choose to marry.</p>

                <p><em>Leonard Forsman is the Chairman of the Suquamish Tribe, located on Port Madison Indian Reservation in Puget Sound in Washington state. Forsman served on the Tribal Council for fifteen years and has been the elected Chairman since 2005. He holds a bachelor's degree in anthropology from the University of Washington and a master's degree in historic preservation from Goucher College. He is the former director of the Suquamish Museum and worked as a professional archaeologist for over a decade for a private consulting firm.</em></p>

		<title>Health Care in the Eleventh Circuit: A Doomed Concept of Federalism</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.jmls.edu/directory/profiles/schwinn-steven/">Steven D. Schwinn</a> of the John Marshall Law School in Chicago says that the Eleventh Circuit ignored the text, history and jurisprudence of the Constitution in its recent health care ruling, which will likely not be adopted by the Supreme Court given recent rulings on congressional Commerce Clause authority...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/stevenschwinn.jpg" height='200' align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>ome will go to any length, it seems, to read their activist views into our Constitution. If an idiosyncratic view is not supported by the text, they search for it in our history. If it is not supported by text or history, they turn to novel interpretations of precedent. And if it is not supported by text, history or precedent, they seem perfectly willing to weave it out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>Such was the evolution of a radical federalist theory that found its way into the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">Eleventh Circuit ruling</a> last month finding that the individual health insurance mandate in the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Affordable Care Act</a> exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The court found that both insurance and health care are matters of traditional state concern, and Congress therefore could not regulate it. This finding is surprising because Congress already heavily regulates insurance and health care through ERISA, COBRA, HIPAA and the ubiquitous and gargantuan Medicare and Medicaid programs. In the opinion, the court relied on self-defined "principles of federalism." </p>

<p>This approach has no support in the text, history or even a proper understanding of the jurisprudence of the Constitution. Those sources emphatically do not say that Congress cannot regulate in areas of traditional state concern; if anything, they say the opposite. The court recognized this and wisely avoided any serious consideration of these sources. Without strong support, the court then unwisely wove its novel principles of federalism out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>Start with the text. Nothing in the original Constitution supports the theory that Congress cannot regulate in areas of traditional state concern. The two important exceptions, which address slavery, do not provide support for the court's principle of federalism today. In fact, the plain text of the original Constitution says the opposite. Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Article I, Section 8</a>, Congress has plenary authority "[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper" to "regulate commerce ... among the several States," without regard to whether such laws or regulations touch on areas of traditional state concern. Moreover, several clauses throughout the text specifically restrict the states, suggesting that there is nothing sacrosanct about areas of traditional state concern. For example, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section10">Article I, Section 10</a> contains a list of restrictions on state action; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Article IV</a>, Sections 1 and 2 similarly contain restrictions on states. This is all punctuated, of course, by the Supremacy Clause in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Article VI</a>, which specifically contemplates an overlap between federal and state law in which federal law will prevail, and this article's Oath of Office Clause, which requires state officers to swear to support the Constitution.</p>

<p>Later amendments restrict state sovereignty to an even greater degree and thus undercut the theory that the Constitution protects areas of traditional state concern. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiii">Thirteenth</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxix">Nineteenth</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxiv">Twenty-Fourth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxvi">Twenty-Sixth</a> Amendments prohibit states from violating various civil rights and authorize Congress to adopt legislation to protect these rights against state interference. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvi">Sixteenth Amendment</a> authorizes Congress to lay and collect an income tax "without apportionment among the several States." And the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxvii">Seventeenth Amendment</a> provides for the direct election of US Senators, ending their appointment by the state legislatures. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentx">Tenth Amendment</a>, the state-righters' perennial favorite, only provides that those "powers not delegated to the United States ... are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." This says nothing about areas of traditional state concern or the extent of federal powers; it is merely a truism in a federal system like ours. Thus, the text and structure do not restrict congressional action based on areas of traditional state concern.</p>

<p>Next consider the history. The best evidence suggests that the framers did not believe that the Constitution protected areas of traditional state concern. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the framers' rejection of anything like Article II in the <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp">Articles of Confederation</a>.  That article, a true state sovereignty protection, read: "Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled." The framers rejected Article II in drafting the Constitution, which, among other defects in the Articles of Confederation, gave rise to a great deal of problems in our earliest government. The closest thing we now have to Article II is the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment, however, omits any reference to state sovereignty, excludes the word "expressly," and includes the phrase "or to the people" &#8212; three differences that make the Tenth Amendment a mere shadow, at most, of the earlier Article II. The framers made these changes to the Tenth Amendment deliberately, in order to ensure that congressional power remained flexible and adaptable, and to reflect the ultimate sovereignty of the people.  </p>

<p>Moreover, the Constitutional Convention debates suggest that the framers did not understand the Constitution to protect areas of traditional state concern. In fact, the convention rejected several proposals to protect state authority. For example, the convention decisively rejected Roger Sherman's proposal to exclude from federal power "matters of internal police which respect the Government of such States only, and wherein the welfare of the United States is not concerned." The convention did not even take up a suggestion by Rufus King that the Constitution expressly protect the "[r]ights of the States in the National Constitution." Later congressional debates over the proposed Tenth Amendment support this. For example, Congress rejected a more robust alternative &#8212; one that would have "reserved to the States" "all powers not <em>expressly</em> delegated to the United States," reflecting the language in Article II of the Articles and restricting congressional authority in relation to the states. Instead, Congress added the phrase "or to the people," underscoring the "popular sovereignty" idea that all power resides first in the people, and that government enjoys power only by their delegation.</p>

<p>James Madison said this in a different way in <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa44.htm">Federalist 44</a>.  Madison wrote that the Necessary and Proper Clause necessarily granted flexible and undefined powers to Congress in order to actuate its enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8 to meet the demands of new and changing times. He wrote that a specific enumeration of powers was impracticable, because it would have to have been "accommodated too not only to the existing state of things, but to all the possible changes which futurity may product; for in every new application of a general power, the <em>particular powers</em>, which are the means of attaining the <em>object</em> of the general power, must always necessarily vary with that object, and be often properly varied whilst the object remain the same." Although Madison's <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa45.htm">Federalist 45</a> is a perennial favorite of state-righters, he recognized that federal power must change with the times, potentially running into areas of traditional state concern, and, of course, that federal law is supreme. In <a href="http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa46.htm">Federalist 46</a> he recognized that protection of the states is best left to political forces. The Constitution does not shield states from federal regulation.</p>

<p>Finally, consider the jurisprudence. The Supreme Court's latest foray into federalism came in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">United States v. Comstock</a>, upholding a federal law that allowed the district courts to order the civil commitment of a "sexually dangerous" federal prisoner even beyond his release date. In that case, five justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, flatly rejected the respondents' argument that the federal law violated the Tenth Amendment because it regulated too far into an area of traditional state concern. Two other justices, Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito, declined to go so far on the federalism questions, but they nevertheless concurred in the result.</p>

<p>The ruling in <em>Comstock</em> is consistent with the previous significant ruling on federal power and areas of traditional state concern, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15647611274064109718">Gonzales v. Raich</a>. The Court in that case also flatly rejected the argument that the federal law, the <a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/index.html">Controlled Substances Act</a>, regulated too far into an area of traditional state concern. Notably, Justice Antonin Scalia, no friend of expansive federal power, wrote in concurrence that "neither respondents nor the dissenters suggest any violation of state sovereignty of the sort that would render this regulation 'inappropriate,' except to argue that the CSA regulates an area typically left to state regulation. <em>That is not enough to render federal regulation an inappropriate means</em>." (Emphasis added)   </p>

<p>To be sure, the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117">United States v. Morrison</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18310045251039502778">United States v. Lopez</a> wrote that this federalism principle &#8212; that Congress cannot interfere too greatly in areas of traditional state concern &#8212; was a consideration in the Court's Commerce Clause analysis. But these cases went against the jurisprudence going back to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14324093602590092926">Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority</a> that said that the Court could not identify "principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on <em>a priori</em> definitions of state sovereignty." Since <em>Garcia</em>, "[s]tate sovereign interests, then, are more properly protected by procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal system than by judicially created limitations on federal power."</p>

<p>Between the earlier <em>Garcia</em> and the later <em>Raich</em> and <em>Comstock</em> decisions, the principle of federalism outlined in <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Lopez</em> look more like an erratic blip on the screen than a durable constitutional doctrine. Yet the Eleventh Circuit elevated it to a virtual element of its Commerce Clause analysis &#8212; a far more significant consideration than it was in even <em>Morrison</em> and <em>Lopez</em>. It did this by ignoring the text, history and jurisprudence of the Constitution. </p>

<p>This was a serious mistake. If adopted by the Supreme Court, it could jeopardize the federalism balance that has been carefully maintained. Thankfully, if the Court's most recent cases reflect a trend, the Supreme Court is unlikely to go along with this novel, activist approach. Instead, the Court will return to a view of federal-state relations that more accurately reflects constitutional values.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.clasp.org/experts?id=0013">Elizabeth Lower-Basch</a>, a Senior Policy Analyst for the <a href="http://www.clasp.org/">Center for Law and Social Policy</a>, argues that Florida's drug testing policy for receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance is harmful to the people the policy is designed to help...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/elizabethlowerbasch.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1" width="5" </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n recent years, many states have proposed mandatory universal or random drug testing for individuals applying for or receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) cash assistance or other public benefits. However, before Florida's law took effect on July 1, only one state, Michigan, had ever required all adult TANF recipients to submit to a drug test. This provision was challenged in court shortly after the legislation was enacted, and Michigan dropped its testing program as a result. We expect that the court will have similar concerns about requiring cash assistance applicants to submit to drug tests, as simply being poor and needing help is not a reasonable cause to believe that an individual is using drugs.</p>

                <p>Putting the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-court-hears-challenge-to-drug-screening-welfare-recipients.php">questionable legality</a> of such laws aside, there is a much deeper social issue regarding perceptions about poor people. These proposals are based on stereotypes rather than evidence. The promise that they will save states significant amounts of money is based on the false assumption that many applicants will test positive for drugs and be denied benefits. Research finds little evidence that drug use or abuse is particularly prevalent among TANF beneficiaries. About 10 years ago, Florida discovered this when it implemented a drug screening and testing pilot program for TANF recipients. Only 3.8 percent of the applicants and recipients in the pilot tested positive for a controlled substance. Recent reports about the new Florida law report similar findings &#8212; 2.5 percent tested positive during the first month. For context, illicit drug use among the general population is 8.7 percent according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

                <p>Governor Rick Scott claims that the testing requirement is designed to protect children by ensuring that cash assistance is not diverted to support a substance abuse habit. However, there are other ways to screen and identify individuals with substance abuse problems that do not treat all welfare recipients as potential criminals and that do not waste taxpayer resources on unnecessary tests. The funds used for these tests could be better used to provide access to treatment programs. Moreover, by forcing applicants to pay up front for their drug tests before they can receive cash assistance, Florida imposes a significant burden on the neediest families, putting vulnerable children at even greater risk. Because of this real immediate harm, we hope that the court will direct Florida to suspend the testing program.</p>

Bush appointee, considers the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-court-hears-challenge-to-drug-screening-welfare-recipients.php">constitutionality of Florida's new drug testing policy</a>, one thing is clear: the new drug testing requirement for welfare cash assistance is having a big impact and is fast becoming a model for other states. </p>

                <p>On September 14, 2011, the Foundation for Government Accountability, a free-market think tank in Naples, Florida, released a <a href="http://www.floridafga.org/2011/09/the-impact-of-florida-new-drug-test-requirement-for-welfare-cash-assistance/">report</a> showing that in July 2011, the first month of the <a href="http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0414/Sections/0414.0652.html">new law</a>, almost one in ten individuals who would have otherwise been approved for welfare cash assistance were denied for a drug-related reason. Most of these denials were due to the fact that the individual never completed the required drug test &#8212; presumably because she thought that she would test positive for drug use, she did not have the money for the test or she chose not to take the test for another reason. Only those adults who are pre-screened as eligible are required to get tested at one of more than 350 sites around Florida. If the individual tests negative for drug use, the state will reimburse that person the approximate $30 cost of the test.  </p>

                <p>If trends from the first month hold, Florida taxpayers could save $9 million a year. The report estimated that similar results nationwide would save $173 million in the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. The drug test requirement, which is specifically allowed under federal law, only applies to cash assistance, not food stamps or Medicaid. Florida policymakers wanted to ensure that cash aimed at helping needy families was not being used to subsidize illegal drug use.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/page1_d_burk.html">Dan Burk</a> of the University of California, Irvine School of Law says the America Invents Act unnecessarily disrupts long settled patent law, creates new opportunities for gamesmanship, foments new litigation and introduces new uncertainty for businesses...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/dan%20burk.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font>fter seven years of controversy and debate, on September 16, 2011, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/obama-signs-patent-reform-bill.php">signed</a> the first major revision of American patent law in nearly 60 years into law, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.00023:">America Invents Act</a>. The legislation has been touted by politicians as modernizing US patent law, harmonizing it with that of its trading partners, simplifying the patent application process, and &#8212; most incredibly &#8212; stimulating 200,000 new jobs.</p>

<p>What the legislation in fact does is to unnecessarily disrupt long settled law, create new opportunities for gamesmanship, foment new litigation and introduce new uncertainty into business decision making. The legislation covers a wide range of procedural, substantive and administrative changes, from fee-setting at the US Patent Office, to precluding tax strategy patents. What follows are illustrations of only a couple of the disruptive provisions that patent experts have begun to grapple with since the legislation was enacted.</p>

<p>The US has long been unusual in two aspects of its patent law. One has been the policy of granting the patent to the first inventor. This has meant that in the US, when more than one applicant claimed a patent for the same invention, the dispute was decided by determining who first invented the device. The US Patent Office sometimes needed to conduct lengthy administrative proceedings, called interferences, to collect evidence regarding the applicants' dates of invention, and award the patent to the earliest inventor. Other countries have followed a policy of granting patents to the first person to file an application. Priority disputes in such countries are simply determined by granting the patent to the application with the earliest date. </p>

<p>A second signature feature of the US patent system has been a "grace period" between disclosure and application. This has meant that inventors had one year after their invention became publicly known to draft and file a patent application. The time period could be triggered by anyone, either an inventor or a third party. By contrast, most countries do not allow a grace period for the inventor or anyone else, but instead follow a standard of absolute novelty. Public disclosure of the claimed invention immediately bars applicants from obtaining a patent in countries following this standard.</p>

<p>The new statutory law has been touted as bringing the US into harmony with other "first to file" jurisdictions for the first time. But the new statute is actually a unique and idiosyncratic regime that has neither the old virtue of familiarity nor the promised virtue of harmonization. The statute now provides that the first <em>inventor</em> to file is entitled to a patent. Unfortunately, the statute gives no indication what mechanism the Patent Office should now use to determine whether a given applicant is an "inventor," or whether the old interference definitions of "inventor" should continue to apply.</p>

<p>The situation is additionally complicated because the statute retains a qualified "grace period" only for inventors. If the inventor, or someone who has obtained information about the invention from the inventor, discloses the invention, a one year clock begins to run. This creates opportunities for strategic disclosure of inventions &#8212; an inventor could publicly disclose the invention in order to block rivals from obtaining a patent, and then file her own patent application within the one year statutory period.</p>

<p>However, such strategies will be complicated by the global economy. Recall that other countries do not allow a grace period. An inventor considering strategic disclosure of the invention would have to surrender the opportunity to obtain a patent in most countries in the world. A US patent would still be available within a year, but elsewhere the preclusion would be immediate. Small entities may choose this strategy if they intend to file only in the US, perhaps because the only real market for the invention is in the US, or perhaps because the expense of filing patents all over the world is prohibitive.</p>

<p>Other opportunities for strategic maneuvering abound in the short term. The new legislation requires the Patent Office to phase out two existing types of administrative challenges to patents over the next year and to implement several new ones. For many years, the US had a system of <em>inter partes</em> "reexamination" whereby anyone believing that a patent was improperly granted could challenge the patent on the basis of unconsidered prior art evidence. A year from the enactment of the new statute, this will be replaced with a system of post-grant opposition, which will be more constricted in timing, but broader in its scope of inquiry.</p>

<p>Similarly, the old interference system will be replaced with a new, narrower "derivation" proceeding that is intended only to determine if the invention claimed in an application has been improperly derived from another inventor. Additionally, third parties can now submit evidence regarding pending applications to the Patent Office. Over the next year-and-a-half, challengers to patents will have to determine whether they wish to invoke such proceedings, and whether it is more advantageous to do so under the old or the new system.</p>

<p>Indeed, some such decisions have already been made. One part of the new legislation is a litigation "non-joinder" provision, which prohibits lawsuits naming multiple parties for infringing the same patent. This is intended to suppress the activity of "non-practicing entities" &#8212; sometimes pejoratively called "trolls" &#151 who derive income from acquiring and enforcing latent patents. The provision raises their cost of enforcement by requiring that patent rights be enforced <em>seriatim</em> against putative infringers. Not surprisingly, the day before Obama signed the act, a record number of patent lawsuits were filed naming multiple parties.</p>

<p>In all, the act entails more than 20 new changes to settled patent law. All will require review by the courts, implementation by the Patent Office and consultation between patent holders and their counsel. If the America Invents Act actually delivers the promised 200,000 jobs, they seem likely to be jobs for patent attorneys, rather than jobs for technological innovators.</p>

<p><em>Dan Burk is the Chancellor's Professor of Law at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. He is a prominent intellectual property scholar, and some of his recent work has considered the statutory "policy levers" used by courts to apply patent incentives to industries with diverse innovation profiles. Burk recently received a Fulbright Scholar grant to pursue research on comparative biotechnology patent processes in Germany.</em></p>

IMS Health Inc.</a> striking down Vermont's <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=18&Chapter=091&Section=04631">Prescription Confidentiality Law</a> has caused a considerable amount of alarm and apprehension among public health advocates. For example, Boston University law professor Kevin Outterson, who filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the law, recently <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1107614">wrote</a> in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that <em>Sorrell</em> threatened the viability of existing or future public health regulations by requiring a new, heightened level of First Amendment scrutiny. Outterson wrote that the decision "bodes ill for marketing regulation of food, tobacco, alcohol, and other products with important public health effects." He added that if the Court's reasoning was applied to the case of tobacco, "cigarette manufacturers might have a First Amendment right to broadcast TV advertisements or target young prospective smokers with cartoons."</p>

<p>The tobacco companies surely agree. Shortly after the <em>Sorrell</em> decision, the tobacco companies challenging the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:s.00982:">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009</a> &#8212; the law authorizing the FDA to regulate tobacco products and restrict tobacco advertising &#8212; filed supplemental briefs <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-on-tobacco-advertising.php">before the Sixth Circuit</a> arguing that <em>Sorrell</em> supports their arguments. In particular, they pointed to the opinion's statement that "the State may not seek to remove a popular but disfavored product from the marketplace by prohibiting truthful, nonmisleading advertisements that contain impressive endorsements or catchy jingles." The tobacco companies brandished the same phrase this past week in legal arguments challenging the FDA's planned <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fda-announces-final-rule-restricting.php">graphic warning labels for cigarette packages</a>.  </p>

<p>While legislators and regulators must pay heed to both the <em>Sorrell</em> decision and the Supreme Court's decision in another First Amendment case with public health implications, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-games-ban.php">Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association</a>, public health officials might overreact to <em>Sorrell</em> and refrain from enacting sound public health measures for fear of running afoul of the First Amendment. This would be both unfortunate and unnecessary.  </p>

<p>Although the Supreme Court's statement about "popular but disfavored product[s]" was troubling, it was ultimately unnecessary to the opinion and is therefore nonbinding dicta. The Court's majority concluded that the test provided by <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1962482840967580827">Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission</a> &#8212; the same standard that has been used to decide commercial speech cases for nearly 30 years &#8212; was sufficient to resolve the case. Largely because Vermont's law barred only certain companies, primarily pharmaceutical companies, from obtaining prescriber-identifiable prescription data for marketing purposes, the Court found that the state had not demonstrated that the statute would significantly further its interests, as required by the <em>Central Hudson</em> test. A broader law that applied to all uses and users of such data &#8212; similar to a law recently enacted in Texas &#8212; likely would have survived a legal challenge. Thus, <em>Sorrell</em> did not break any new legal ground. Further, at least with respect to privacy-related laws, the scope of the decision is quite limited and can be minimized with good legislative drafting.</p>

<p>As to the broader public health implications of the decision, they may not be as dire as predicted. Nothing in the decision referenced tobacco, alcohol, obesity or other similar public health problems, and these issues are quite distinguishable from the restrictions on name-brand pharmaceutical marketing at issue in <em>Sorrell</em>. The <em>Central Hudson</em> test clearly provides that advertising with respect to illegal activities can be restricted, and tobacco and alcohol use by minors is, of course, illegal. Moreover, the <em>Sorrell</em> decision involved "sophisticated and experienced" consumers &#8212; physicians. The Court tends to be more flexible when the restriction at issue is intended to protect the general public, and even more so when the protection of children is at issue.</p>

<p><em>Sorrell</em> emphasized the need to protect the "free flow of commercial speech" so that consumers could make informed choices on issues important to their health. The Court found such concerns are particularly relevant in the case of pharmaceuticals that have the potential to save lives. Obviously, consumers have a less acute interest in obtaining, and the government has a heightened interest in limiting, information about inherently dangerous products &#8212; and again, this is even more apt with respect to marketing to children. Ultimately, <em>Sorrell</em> has no relevance at all to laws requiring disclosures of factual information to promote a legitimate government interest such as the protection of public health, as is the case with the FDA's new cigarette warnings. Laws requiring such disclosures &#8212; whether on pharmaceuticals, cigarettes, food or other products &#8212; are subjected to a lower level of First Amendment scrutiny that was not at issue in <em>Sorrell</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sorrell</em> does not portend a significant shift in the way courts will address advertising restrictions relevant to tobacco use or other public health problems. While the Court's decisions in <em>Sorrell</em> and <em>Brown</em> are problematic for their willingness to second-guess both legislative decisions and peer-reviewed public health research, the decisions do not fundamentally change the applicable First Amendment standards. Public health officials and policymakers need not overreact to these decisions and should continue to pursue public health measures based on sound science.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/andrea-prasow">Andrea Prasow</a> of Human Rights Watch says that Obama has corrected course from the worst of the Bush-era detainee abuses but the US should implement public procedural safeguards to ensure detainees are not transferred to countries where they face a risk of torture...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forumy/andreaprasownew.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>A</b></font> cache of documents recently uncovered by Human Rights Watch in Tripoli brought into public view a convenient tool of international relations &#8212; so-called "diplomatic assurances." Such assurances, promises requested of governments to treat detainees humanely, have a dark side. Although seemingly intended to ensure the safety and well-being of detainees, they in fact have been used in the rendition of individuals to the custody of governments with known records of torture. This was especially true during the Bush administration when the US government transferred people to countries notorious for torturing prisoners, such as Egypt, Jordan and Libya.</p>

<p>Although the Obama administration must be commended for reforming many Bush-era practices such as use of CIA "black sites" and many abusive interrogation techniques, it has failed to renounce reliance on diplomatic assurances when transferring detainees to other countries. Any policy changes it may have made to minimize the risk that transferred detainees will not face torture have not been made public. </p>

<p>Ratified by the US in 1994, the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/catcidtp/catcidtp.html">Convention Against Torture</a> absolutely prohibits returning a person to a country where he or she is in danger of being tortured or, as is widely accepted, ill-treated. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=echr">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) and courts in the UK have found diplomatic assurances to be unreliable and insufficient to satisfy a state's obligation under the treaty.</p>

<p>As the cases highlighted in the documents discovered by Human Rights Watch show, relying on these assurances is useless. In Libya, and likely scores of other places, a promise of humane treatment in no way meant a detainee would not face the risk of torture upon transfer. The apparent transfer of Abdul Hakim Belhaj by the US to Libya is one stark example of the hollowness of diplomatic assurances. Belhaj, now the rebel military commander in Tripoli, was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), which had sought to overthrow the Gaddafi regime. When transferring Belhaj to Libya in 2004, the US blithely sought assurances that Belhaj would be treated humanely and that his human rights would be respected, presumably in an attempt to satisfy obligations under the Convention Against Torture. </p>

<p>Belhaj has subsequently alleged he was tortured by the CIA, transferred to Libyan custody and then tortured by Libyan officials. He claims that both British and American officials knew he was tortured while in Libyan custody but did nothing to stop the abuse. The US Department of State's own <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41727.htm">2004 Human Rights Country Report on Libya</a> stated that Libyan security personnel routinely tortured prisoners by, among other things, applying electric shock, breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffocating with plastic bags, and depriving detainees of food and water. Given Libya's record, Belhaj's experience surely came as no surprise. </p>

<p>After taking office, President Barack Obama corrected course from the worst of the Bush-era detainee abuses and ordered the creation of a task force that reviewed, among other things, the practice of transferring detainees to other counties, including the use of diplomatic assurances. </p>

<p>While reiterating the fact that the US may continue to rely on these assurances, the task force suggested a number of things "aimed at clarifying and strengthening US procedures for obtaining and evaluating those assurances." These included having the State Department involved in evaluating the assurances as well as having it prepare an annual coordinated report with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security on transfers conducted by each agency. The task force also suggested establishing better mechanisms for monitoring once a detainee is transferred but failed to enumerate how those mechanisms might actually work. The task force made recommendations specific to immigration and military transfers but failed to state what those recommendations were. Finally, while it made recommendations regarding how to ensure safe treatment of a detainee when the intelligence community is involved in a transfer, it did not make those recommendations public. </p>

<p>Not only are these recommendations insufficient, but the administration has not even made clear if they have been adopted. There should be a process in place to ensure that those who fear torture can raise their concerns before an impartial adjudicator. Where transfers are permissible, the administration should also detail how it will improve monitoring of transferred detainees and what steps it will take if it discovers mistreatment of one of its transferees. Unless and until these policies are made public, it is impossible to assess whether current policy satisfies US obligations under the Convention Against Torture. </p>

<p>While no new cases of rendition of the type conducted by the CIA under the Bush administration have been reported, the absence of a clear public policy makes the administration vulnerable to critics. In the past, secret policies led to secret torture. So when allegations surface, as they did this summer, of CIA involvement in transfers to and interrogation in places like Somalia, the administration's refusal to provide details about its policies raises serious concerns. </p>

<p>It is high time for the Obama administration to renounce the practice of relying on diplomatic assurances when transferring detainees to governments with known records of detainee abuse. If procedural safeguards are in place to ensure detainees are not transferred to countries where they face a risk of torture, the administration should be proud of such policies. There is no need to keep them secret.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stmarytx.edu/ctl/index.php?site=centerForTerrorismLawDirectors">Jeffrey Addicott</a> of St. Mary's University School of Law says that despite the confusion as to whether US criminal law or the law of war should apply, the killing of Anwar al-Awlaqi was legal under the law of war, which must govern in this instance...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/jeffaddicottnew2.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he confusion associated with the legality of the recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">killing of Anwar al-Awlaqi</a>, al-Qaeda cleric and leader, by CIA drone strike in Yemen reflects very poorly on the US government. It is not because the killing was illegal as some have alleged, it is precisely the opposite. The killing <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-legal-memo-justifies-killing-of-al-awlaqi.php">was perfectly legal</a>, and yet due to the inability of the Commander-in-Chief to articulate this fact, many in the US and around the globe accuse America of wrongdoing. Amazingly, not a single voice in the Obama administration seems to be able to defend its actions as lawful under a simple set of facts. Instead of statements associated with the fact that this was a defensive action taken against a terrorist, the foundational rule of law justification has nothing to do with the fact that al-Awlaqi was a terrorist or a bad person. The justification for the lawful use of force against al-Awlaqi is as follows: (1) the US is at war with al-Qaeda under the 2001 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:S.J.Res23:#">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a>; (2) the law of war applies to the war, not domestic criminal law; (3) the law of war allows the US to kill any enemy combatant on sight, detain an enemy combatant indefinitely or use military commissions when appropriate.</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> editorial page of October 4, 2011 carried six letters to the editor on the topic of al-Awlaqi's death which was covered in the paper on October 1, 2011. Of those six letters, only one of them understood that the killing was an entirely lawful act carried out under the law of war. All the others reflected varying degrees of confusion over whether the US was wrong for not operating under domestic criminal law, was wrong for killing a US citizen, or that the rule of law did not really matter because al-Awlaqi was a "bad guy" and therefore his killing was justified.  </p>

<p>With the devastating terror attacks of September 11, 2001 by al-Qaeda enemy combatants on the US, terrorism is not just another crime to be investigated by the FBI and handed over to an Assistant US Attorney for prosecution. Whatever else the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">tenth anniversary</a> of these attacks have signified, it is unfortunate that a decade later there still remains great public confusion when it comes to comprehending fundamental legal concepts associated with how the US conducts the war against al-Qaeda. If the terror attacks are carried out by enemy combatants such as al-Qaeda, the proper rule of law is the law of war. If the terror attacks are carried out by those inspired by radical Islam, then the proper rule of law remains domestic criminal law. </p>

<p>Some may argue that the fault for all this confusion rests with the lack of international consensus on relevant standards that should be adopted to deal with "international terrorism," or that the Bush administration-created phrase "War on Terror" itself is horribly vague. However, the root cause of this confusion actually centers around the inability of the US government to properly distinguish al-Qaeda enemy combatant terrorists from domestic jihadi terrorists. This confusion began in small measures in the Bush administration but is magnified to absurd degrees in the Obama administration. Obama's ill-conceived <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php#closure">attempts to close Guantanamo Bay</a>, stop <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php#guantanamo">military commissions</a>, prosecute senior enemy combatants in federal court, and generally refuse to acknowledge to the public that the conflict with al-Qaeda is a real war, have sown mass distortion and consternation about the legality of US actions.  </p>

<p>The reason that all this matters is that if the US is operating under the rule of law associated with domestic criminal law vis-&#224;-vis al-Qaeda, then the US has engaged in horrid violations of domestic and international law in the past 10 years. That does not authorize the killing al-Qaeda members on sight, detaining them indefinitely without trial and using military commissions to prosecute them. On the other hand, if it is a real war then all of these actions are perfectly lawful.</p>

<p>In the case of Anwar al-Awlaqi, if he was a member of al-Qaeda, which he was, then he qualifies for treatment under the full parameters of the law of war. Thus, it is not a violation of the law of war for the US to kill an al-Qaeda member without warning, even if he is also a US citizen. If that US citizen is an enemy combatant then the law of war can be used as the proper rule of law to deal with him. While it is true that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.03930:#">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a>, along with the updated <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2647:">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a>, did exclude US citizen al-Qaeda members from trial by military commissions, this was a self-imposed rule, not a rule mandated by the law of war. In fact, at least one US citizen serving in the German military in World War II was prosecuted and executed for war crimes.</p>

<p>Finally, the number one threat facing the US comes from a loose confederation of radicalized violent Islamic jihadists who engage in terrorism. Some qualify as enemy combatants and some do not. Clearly, while all al-Qaeda enemy combatants can be labeled as "violent jihadists," not all violent jihadists are enemy combatants. In this light, violent jihadists that do not qualify as enemy combatants must be deemed as domestic terrorists, but violent jihadists that do qualify as enemy combatants must be treated under the law of war.  </p>

<p>Indeed, out of all of the nascent legal and policy issues associated with the armed conflict against al-Qaeda, no factor has spawned more debate than correctly applying this separation. The inability to clearly set bright lines of distinction between al-Qaeda enemy combatants and domestic jihadists is not just a failure in definition; it is a failure in leadership and does tremendous damage to the US commitment to abide by the proper rule of law. The US must be able to clearly distinguish between criminals and belligerents and then apply the appropriate rule of law to each category.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.howard.edu/1529">Morris Davis</a> of Howard University School of Law says the recent killing of Anwar al-Awlaqi highlights the fact that the CIA drone program violates the law of war because it is a civilian institution, lacking combatant immunity...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/morrisdavis.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font> have been critical of President Barack Obama's embrace and expansion of the national security policies he inherited from President George W. Bush and it is deeply disappointing that he seems to have forgotten the shortcomings he condemned during the campaign and in his first few months in office. JURIST Contributing Editor Jeffrey Addicott was correct when he argued in a recent article, <a href="/forum/2011/10/jeffrey-addicott-al-awlaqi.php">Anwar al-Awlaqi and the Law of War</a>, that President Obama has shown "a failure in leadership" that "does tremendous damage to the US commitment to abide by the proper rule of law." I do not, however, agree with Addicott's rationale.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Addicott argues that anyone can see that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">killing of Anwar al-Awlaqi</a> was "perfectly legal" and he ridicules President Obama for his failure to explain to the American people and the world that killing al-Awlaqi was legally justified by the 2001 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:S.J.Res23:#">Authorization for the Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) and the law of war. The fact that not everyone has his perfect clarity shows it is not really that simple.</p>

<p>On September 12, 2001, President Bush submitted a proposal to Congress to authorize a military response to the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a>. On September 14, 2001, the Senate voted 98-0 and the House voted 420-1 to pass the AUMF as a joint resolution "authoriz[ing] the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States."</p>

<p>There are two significant points related to the AUMF that Addicott ignores. First, the AUMF authorized the use of military force, period. Reports on the drone strike against Anwar al-Awlaqi in Yemen say that it was conducted by the CIA, a civilian agency made up of civilian employees and civilian contractors. The US Armed Forces operate a military-run drone program, but military force did not kill al-Awlaqi. Second, Congress purposefully limited the scope of the president's authority to use force. President Bush's <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22357.pdf">proposed resolution</a> [PDF] contained language that would have allowed him to engage those responsible for 9/11 and also take action "to deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States." Congress removed the latter provision from the final joint resolution. As Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/22/AR2005122201101.html">explained</a>, "Congress denied the president the more expansive authority he sought and insisted that his authority be used specifically against Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda."</p>

<p>Few if any of the 518 members of Congress who voted for the AUMF in September 2001 could have imagined that they were conferring legal justification more than a decade later for a CIA conducted civilian missile strike on a US citizen (who was an imam at a DC area mosque, the Muslim chaplain for George Washington University, and a religious scholar consulted regularly by major news organizations at the time the AUMF passed) in Yemen several months after <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">Osama Bin Laden was killed</a>. The al-Awlaqi scenario appears to be closer to the power President Bush had proposed that was deliberately rejected by Congress.</p>

<p>Similarly, Addicott's explanation of what the law of war permits is on the mark, but his application to the killing of al-Awlaqi glosses over some genuine issues by focusing solely on the status of the target of the attack and ignoring the status of the attackers. Generally, the deliberate killing of another human being is considered murder unless some legal justification provides immunity. The law of war does just that by extending combatant immunity to lawful combatants who kill in the course of armed conflict, provided they comply with the law of war, as JURIST contributor Geoffrey Corn noted a May 2006 article entitled <a href="/hotline/2006/05/war-crimes-and-limits-of-combatant.php">War Crimes and the Limits of Combatant Immunity.</a> The CIA's civilian employees and civilian contractors are not lawful combatants and are not entitled to combatant immunity. As the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions Philip Alston <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.24.Add6.pdf">reported</a> [PDF]:<blockquote>[I]ntelligence personnel do not have immunity from prosecution under domestic law for their conduct. They are thus unlike State armed forces which would generally be immune from prosecution for the same conduct (assuming they complied with [international humanitarian law] requirements). Thus, CIA personnel could be prosecuted for murder under the domestic law of any country in which they conduct targeted drone killings, and could also be prosecuted for violations of applicable US law.</blockquote>The law of war provides lawful combatants with immunity from responsibility for collateral damage that occurs when they conduct legitimate attacks on legitimate military objectives. That includes immunity from responsibility for civilians killed in the course of a proper attack on a legitimate military target. Addicott's article focuses solely on the killing of al-Awlaqi and fails to mention that three others died in the attack. He also fails to explain how the law of war immunizes CIA civilians for killing other civilians &#8212; what would be collateral damage in the course of a legitimate military attack by lawful combatants &#8212; in the absence of combatant immunity.</p>

<p>The concern over using civilian CIA personnel to conduct combat operations is not inconsequential. A primary objective of the law of war is to limit the effects of war, particularly the effects on civilians and civilian objects. A fundamental law of war principle is distinction, which mandates uniforms or other distinctive markings to clearly denote combatants. The failure to comply with the principle of distinction, a fundamental requirement for lawful combatancy, is one of the reasons the US cites for classifying enemy detainees as unlawful combatants rather than prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The importance of the combatant-civilian distinction was apparent when the Pentagon <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pentagon-releases-manual-for-military.php">prepared</a> the latest version of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/d2010manual.pdf">Manual for Military Commissions</a> [PDF], the rulebook for the trials of some of the alleged unlawful enemy combatants at <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php#guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a>. The 2007 version of the Manual for Military Commissions, which made rules implementing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s.03930:">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a>, said that "[f]or the accused to have been acting in violation of the law of war, the accused must have taken acts as a combatant without having met the requirements for lawful combatancy." It went on to add that such persons "do not enjoy combatant immunity because they have failed to meet the requirements of lawful combatancy under the law of war." That language was removed when the current manual was drafted because of concerns among senior US government officials that the language on lawful combatancy and combatant immunity could be viewed as an acknowledgment that CIA civilian drone operators are committing war crimes.</p>

<p>Whether it is operating simultaneous military and civilian drone programs or using a Pakistani medical doctor, who had special protected status under the law of war as medical personnel, to acquire information on Bin Laden (who was a legitimate military objective), the US undermines the law of war by blurring the intended bright line separating combatants from civilians. The ability to bend the law to what we want it to be at any given moment diminishes us and our commitment to abide by the proper rule of law. That truly is a failure in leadership.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Social networks are undoubtedly the modern disseminators of relevant news, and in large part, of controversial debates. This past week, a <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_a4q3XWLhr0/TeHDvka7UBI/AAAAAAAAGjs/Msl6Osd2yCs/s1600/raoni.jpg">photo</a> of Chief Raoni Metuktire was spread around Facebook. Raoni was shown crying in reaction to President Dilma Rousseff's authorization of the construction of the Belo Monte dam. Along with the photo came a collection of 600,000 signatures condemning plans to construct the dam, as well as a technical analysis of the dam's probable impact: the destruction of approximately 400,000 hectares of forest and the expulsion of around 40,000 persons from their natural habitat.

The Brazilian government defends the dam's construction as a measure essential to meeting the country's growing energy demand. However, arguments to the contrary seem more appealing and draw more support. These have led to a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/09/brazil-judge-blocks-amazon-jungle-dam-construction.php">preliminary order</a> for the suspension of exploratory and construction projects related to the Belo Monte proposal, rendered by Judge Martins of the Federal Court of First Region in a recent <a href="http://processual.trf1.jus.br/consultaProcessual/processo.php?proc=3263720114013903&amp;secao=PA&amp;nome=norte%20energia&amp;mostrarBaixados=N">disposition</a> [Portuguese].

The lawsuit was filed by the Altamira Association of Fish Breeders and Exporters (ACEPOAT), who asked to suspend any work that would interfere with the natural course of the Xingu River. From a legal standpoint, the preservation of national forests, flora and fauna are the constitutional obligations of each level of the Brazilian government. In fact, <a href="http://www.animallaw.info/nonus/statutes/stbrconst_8en.htm">Article 225</a> of the Brazilian Constitution specifies the government's obligation, among others, to protect the flora and fauna so as to ensure the right of Brazilian citizens to an ecologically balanced environment.

Furthermore, the Brazilian Constitution devotes an entire chapter to the indigenous population — <a href="http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2006/teams/willr3/const.htm#CHAPTER%20VIII%20-%20INDIANS">Title VIII, Chapter VIII</a>. This chapter contains several provisions according to which the construction of the Belo Monte dam is unlawful. The article's main purpose is clear in its provision of constitutional rights to the indigenous peoples and the state's obligation to protect these rights. The next paragraphs, the first and second in particular, define the parameters and purpose of the lands traditionally occupied by indigenous persons, as well as ensuring their protection. It is very important to note that the lands cited by this article are inalienable and indisposable; this reinforces the constitutional significance of rights to the lands. Also of interest is the fifth paragraph, which clearly prohibits the removal of indigenous persons from their constitutionally guaranteed lands, except in cases of catastrophe or epidemic which endanger the population. Additionally, Brazil's sovereign interest may also justify removal, but it must follow a decision of the National Congress, and most importantly, the land must be returned immediately upon the expiration of that interest. Of course, none of these exceptions apply to the case of Belo Monte. Lastly, the sixth paragraph provides that any action with the object to occupy, control or possess the protected land is null and void. An existing exception could be found in the public interest, as provided for by the "lei complementar," or laws complementing the constitution.

It appears that this article has in fact been extended to protect indigenous persons and the land which they inhabit, constituting a prima facie barrier to the dam's construction. As quoted by Ricardo Verdun, an advisor from the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies (INESC) in his <a href="http://www.inesc.org.br/biblioteca/publicacoes/artigos/169-segue-para-o-ralo/">article</a> [Portuguese], this interpretation of Article 231 is shared by Deputy Attorney General of the Republic of the Federal Public Ministry, Dr. Sandra Cureau. Moreover, the construction of the plant violates <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?C169">Convention 169 of the International Labour Organisation</a>, duly ratified by Brazil via <a href="http://www6.senado.gov.br/legislacao/ListaPublicacoes.action?id=234865">Legislative Decree 143</a> [Portuguese]. Another impediment is presented by federal prosecutors of the state of Para, who filed a <a href="http://processual.trf1.jus.br/consultaProcessual/processo.php?proc=968-19.2011.4.01.3900&amp;secao=PA&amp;enviar=Pesquisar">Public Civil Action</a> [Portuguese], arguing that the construction license is invalid for not having met the prerequisites established by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA).

The Belo Monte debate has already transcended national borders. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) has formally <a href="http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/IACHR_letter_Belo%20Monte_eng_040111.pdf">asked the Brazilian government to suspend the plant's construction</a> [PDF].

<span>While the Brazilian government attempts to improve its image regarding Belo Monte at all costs, opposition groups — mostly nongovernmental organizations — continue to alert us of the inevitable harms of this project and put forth their best efforts to block it. While the latter has recently won a battle, they are not guaranteed to win the war. Given the case's complexity, delays in the justice system, and the fact that we are at the project's planning stages, the process is just beginning. It is difficult to speculate on the fate of Belo Monte and the region's indigenous population since unknown political and economic motives are bound to dictate the future.</span>

<strong><span>--------</span></strong>

É indiscutível o papel interpretado pelas redes sociais hoje em dia, na disseminação de notícias relevantes e, em sua grande maioria, polêmicas. Neste contexto, foi veiculado em larga escala no Facebook durante esta semana, foto do cacique Raoni Metuktire, chorando ao saber que a construção da represa de Belo Monte havia sido autorizada pela Presidente Dilma Rousseff. Juntamente à foto, um texto mencionando um documento com cerca de 600.000 assinaturas contra a construção da represa, bem como as especificações do impacto da construção do mesmo: a devastação de aproximadamente 400.000 hectares de floresta e a expulsão de uma monta de 40.000 índios de seu habitat.

O Governo Brasileiro justifica a construção da represa como sendo essencial para suprir a demanda energética em virtude do crescimento econômico apresentado na ultima década, em especial. Contudo, são maiores os argumentos contrários a sua construção. E encontram maiores adeptos. Contudo, o contexto acima informado tomou ares de renovação, com o deferimento de liminar de suspensão dos trabalhos de exploração e construção da represa, proferida pelo Juiz Carlos Eduardo Castro Martins, da Tribunal Regional Federal da Primeira Região.

A ação foi ajuizada pela Associação dos Criadores e Exportadores de Peixes Ornamentais de Altamira (ACEPOAT) e buscou a suspensão de qualquer obra que viesse a interferir no curso natural do Rio Xingu. Do ponto de vista legal, é obrigação Constitucional e de competência comum da União, dos Estados, do Distrito Federal e dos Municípios a preservação das florestas, da fauna e da flora (Constituição Federal). Em prosseguimento, previsto no art. 225 da Carta Magna Brasileira, está à obrigação do Poder Público em proteger a fauna e a flora, entre outras obrigações, como forma de proteção ao direito ao Meio Ambiente ecologicamente concentrado.

E de mais a mais, a Constituição Brasileira separa um Capítulo inteiro destinado à população indígena — Título VIII, Capítulo VIII. Encontram-se diversas justificativas que contrariam a legitimação à construção da represa de Belo Monte, dispostas no art. 231. O caput é claro ao demonstrar os direitos constitucionais dos índios e a obrigação da União em proteger estes direitos. Os seguintes parágrafos, em especial o primeiro e segundo, apontam a definição e a destinação das terras ocupadas pelos índios, bem como sua proteção. Muito importante mencionar que estas terras, citadas no presente artigo, são inalienáveis e indisponíveis e os direitos sobre estas terras, imprescritíveis — o que reforça sua importância constitucional. Interessante destacar o disposto no quinto parágrafo, onde se verifica que é proibida a remoção dos índios de suas terras constitucionalmente garantidas, salvo em caso de catástrofe ou epidemia que coloque em risco sua população. E mais, em caso de interesse da soberania do País, vinculado à deliberação obrigatória do Congresso Nacional e — o mais importante — com retorno imediato às terras após cessada a exceção. De certo, nenhuma dessas exceções é o caso que ora é debatido. E para finalizar esta afirmativa, o parágrafo sexto determina que qualquer ato que tenha por objeto a ocupação, domínio ou posse das terras protegidas, são nulos e extintos. Existe a ressalva quanto ao interesse publico da União, devendo estar disposto em Lei Complementar.

Verifica-se que o referido Artigo foi extenso em se preocupar com a proteção aos índios e suas terras o que, prima facie não trás sentido à construção da barreira. Conforme citado por Ricardo Verdum, assessor do Instituto de Estudos Socioeconômicos (INESC), em seu artigo Construção da Usina Belo Monte viola Constituição e Convenção da OIT, o entendimento acima é partilhado pela Subprocuradora-geral da Republica do Ministério Público Federal, Dra. Sandra Cureau, pela exata leitura do art. 231 da Carta Magna Brasileira. E mais, que a construção da usina fere a Convenção 169 da Organização Internacional do Trabalho, devidamente ratificada pelo Brasil pelo Decreto Legislativo 143. Outro impeditivo para o prosseguimento da construção da usina é apresentado pelo Ministério Público Federal do Estado do Pará, que ajuizou Ação Civil Pública argüindo que a licença para construção da usina é ilegal por não ter atendido os pré-requisitos estabelecidos pelo Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Renováveis (IBAMA) para licenciamento do projeto.

A discussão sobre Belo Monte já ultrapassou as fronteiras nacionais do País. A Comissão Interamericana de Direitos Humanos (CIDH) da Organização dos Estados Americanos (OEA) havia baixado uma medida cautelar pedindo ao Governo Brasileiro que suspendesse a construção da usina, se retratou através de carta enviada à Presente Dilma Rousseff.

Enquanto o Governo Brasileiro tenta a todos os custos possíveis melhorar a imagem da construção da usina, agentes de oposição — ONGs em sua grande maioria — continuam alertando para os danos que advirão da construção da mesma e aplicando seus maiores esforços em evitar que isto ocorra. E, recentemente, obtiveram vitória em uma batalha, o que não garante a vitória da guerra.

O processo está apenas iniciando, em frente à complexidade do caso, aliado à morosidade da justiça bem como o fato de que esta é apenas mais uma tentativa de construção da usina, que já se estende por quase 30 anos. Fato é que o destino de Belo Monte e da população indígena que na região se encontram ainda é incerto, enevoado por motivações políticas e econômicas, o que dificulta qualquer previsão, seja ela otimista ou pessimista, quanto à sua conclusão.

She writes on the need to provide regulations that prevent bill shock...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/mariafechter.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>I</strong></font>n 2010, Kerfye Pierre traveled to Haiti to help the victims of the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haiti+earthquake">devastating earthquake</a>. Upon her return to the US, T-Mobile had billed her $35,000 for cell phone usage while in Haiti. Although Pierre was aware that T-Mobile had granted its customers that were volunteering in Haiti a temporary free voice plan, T-Mobile failed to make clear that it was still charging for data and text messaging services. While in Haiti, Pierre text messaged friends and family to let them know she was safe. T-Mobile never alerted Pierre that it was charging her for those text messages at a higher roaming rate. She remained unaware of this higher charge until she received the bill. T-Mobile offered to reduce Pierre's $35,000 bill to $5,000, which was still unaffordable.</p>

<p>Kerfye Pierre is not alone in her experience with "bill shock." A recent survey done by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) indicated that 30 million Americans &#8212; or one in six cellphone users &#8212; have experienced bill shock, and 88 percent of those users were not contacted by their cell phone companies before incurring such charges. The charges range from a dollar to thousands of dollars above a customer's normal monthly bill. 23 percent of the customers surveyed reported charges that exceeded their normal monthly bill by more than $100.</p>

<p>To address this problem, the FCC proposed a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/empowering-consumers-avoid-bill-shock-consumer-information-and-disclosure">regulation</a> that will "empower consumers to avoid bill shock." Under the regulation, cell phone companies are required to alert customers when they are approaching or begin incurring overage or roaming charges. Additionally, under the FCC's proposed regulation companies must provide clear disclosure of any tools offered to track usage. The question remains: are these protections really enough?  </p>

<p>One major flaw in the FCC's proposed regulation is that it does not require cell phone companies to allow customers to cap their usage. Such capping requirements would mean that customers could select a specific overage amount, for example $50, at which point their wireless service would be disabled. The purpose of this requirement would be to provide a secondary protection for consumers in case they exceeded their monthly plan's allowances. Thus, customers would be alerted if they are approaching, or begin incurring, overage or roaming charges, as the FCC's proposed regulation currently proscribes. Then they could also choose to set a specific capping amount at which their service would be disabled altogether. In fact, the FCC has a model to look to for these capping requirements, the EU's 2007 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:171:0032:0032:EN:PDF">regulation</a> [PDF] to address the bill shock problem in Europe. Given the capping requirement's success in EU regulation, this requirement would create a more complete regulation for US wireless customers, and would empower them to proactively avoid the bill shock problem. </p>

<p>The FCC's proposed regulation also fails to address the problem of a consumer's ability to block services that they wish to exclude. The danger of not including such a provision in the proposed regulation can be exemplified by the dynamics of a family wireless plan. Children on family plans have access to costly services through their personal wireless devices, like premium text messages, yet they may not understand the true cost of those services. Premium text messages are text messages provided by third party content providers that subject customers to additional charges beyond their standard messaging charges. For example, consumers may incur premium fees by participating in interactive voting during television shows, purchasing ring tones, or subscribing to daily jokes that are sent to your cell phone. Without enabling parents to limit their children's usage of specific services, wireless companies are exposing parents to the bill shock that may result after their children have already incurred these unexpected fees. Thus, the FCC's bill shock regulation should make the ability to block specific services mandatory, as such a requirement would further the FCC's mission of providing greater transparency and allowing consumers to set personal limits on their cellular usage. </p>

<p>Furthermore, these two additions to the proposed regulation are well within the FCC's authority to institute. In light of the broad discretionary standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765">Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</a>, and the great public interest at hand in regulating to protect consumers against bill shock, the FCC certainly has the authority to enact such a regulation under the Communications Act.</p>

<p>All in all, the call for bill shock protection is merely a call for transparency and consumer empowerment. Wireless companies should give their customers adequate information upfront to prevent bill shock from ever occurring. Specifically, consumers should be notified if they are exceeding their usual monthly bill amount, they should be aware of the tools that are available to monitor their usage, and they should have the ability to protect themselves from incurring such charges. </p>

		<title>Tymoshenko Sentencing a Tragic Use of Selective Justice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.smorodsky.com/about.htm">Myroslaw Smorodsky</a> of the Board of Governors of the <a href="http://uaba.org/">Ukrainian American Bar Association</a> says the sentencing of Yulia Tymoshenko was politically motivated and a tragic miscarriage of justice that will impact the credibility of Ukraine worldwide...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/myroslawsmorodsky1.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>xperienced trial lawyers worldwide realize that media reports of high profile cases quite often do not accurately reflect the judicial event they narrate. However, if the overwhelming majority of press and other observers describe a persistent pattern of prosecutorial overreaching and politicization, then the matter calls for closer scrutiny to determine the correctness of these commentaries. The conviction and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentencing</a> of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine, has now become, in the words of Alice in Wonderland, "curiouser and curiouser." Has the Queen of Hearts of Orange Revolutionary fame lost her political head and personal freedom in a politically biased judicial execution? If so, on what evidentiary basis and was it in a fair and just manner?</p>

                <p>The vast majority of observers in Ukraine and abroad recognized from the onset that the prosecution was politically motivated and constituted selective justice. No amount of breast-beating protestation to the contrary will alter this obvious truth. The Ukrainian prosecutors had fair warning from the international community that continuing on the selective justice path was a fool's errand and would not only discredit Ukraine's government, but also the Ukrainian judicial system and would most likely endanger Ukraine's geopolitical interests. Regrettably, the prosecution preferred to blindly ignore these dire warnings and commenced a surreal Kafkaesque trial which had spiraled virally out of control, inflicting irreparable damage to any vestige of Ukrainian prosecutorial or judicial credibility in the eyes of the world.  </p>

                <p>Yulia Tymoshenko was criminally convicted of exceeding her authority as Ukraine's prime minister in January 2009, for allegedly instructing, without the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, governmentally owned NAK Naftogaz to enter into financially unfavorable long term gas contracts with Russia's Gazprom, resulting in purported economic damage to Ukraine. There was no allegation or any evidence of personal financial profit. This type of criminal conviction is reminiscent of Soviet-era justice where errors in political or economic judgment (or failure to meet harvest output quota) would conclusively relegate the transgressor to a gulag in Siberia.</p>

                <p>As was noted by the Danish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, the accusations against Tymoshenko would not be considered criminal in other democratic countries &#8212; rather; they would have political or civil consequences only. In the US, acts committed by government officials which are beyond their political authority are routinely declared null and void and of no effect by courts as being <em>ultra vires</em>, or "beyond the powers", without imposing criminal responsibility.  </p>

                <p>The evidence on which the Tymoshenko conviction was based, viewed in the most favorable light for the prosecution, puts into question whether her criminal conviction was convincingly and justly proved even under Ukrainian law. After all, is it not universally accepted in democratic societies that the prosecution has the burden of proof to establish the defendant's guilt to a reasonable certainty?</p>

                <p>During the course of the Tymoshenko trial, a parade of witnesses testified as to the claimed damage occasioned to Ukraine as a result of the alleged wrongful conduct of the former prime minister. Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko lent his voice to the chorus condemning his former ally, claiming she betrayed Ukrainian interests by agreeing to an inflated price with Gazprom. In stark contrast, the Russian Foreign Ministry, probably motivated to come forward by self interest in preserving the 2009 contracts, was quick to denounce his testimony as a lie stating that Yushchenko was fully aware of the negotiations and even confirmed to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that the Ukrainian prime minister was authorized to do so. Other prosecution witnesses have further impeached the credibility of the prosecution's own case and testified that Tymoshenko's acts were within the realm of her authority as Ukrainian prime minister or had the presumption of validity since the gas contracts were not invalidated by the courts. Nor did the prosecution's own actions help rehabilitate its credibility either. It had opposed the defendant's call to question former officials of her government or to call as witnesses the obviously indispensable parties who negotiated the gas contract on the Russian side. </p>

                <p>Most importantly, the prosecution had failed during the trial to ask its witnesses &#8212; especially Yushchenko &#8212; why none of them initiated a court action in January 2009, or at anytime thereafter, to declare the 2009 gas contracts invalid. The issue of the validity of the contracts was a question of public debate since January 2009. This issue was the sole lynchpin centerpiece in the case against the former prime minister. Surely, persons in the government or the opposition had a right, if not a duty, to do so if they sincerely believed that the prime minister exceeded her powers. Why did the Yushchenko administration and the present administration continue to abide by the terms of the 2009 gas contracts if they contradicted Ukrainian law? Tymoshenko's prosecution, on the basis of the feeble evidence presented, now puts the prosecution in the unenviable position &#8212; if one follows basic logic &#8212; of having to prosecute the present and past governments for criminal complicity on the grounds that they continued to honor contracts which they knew to be invalid. If the Ukrainian prosecutors fail to do so, it will only cement the prevalent world opinion that the criminal conviction and sentencing of Yulia Tymoshenko was solely a politically motivated act.  </p>

                <p>The Tymoshenko conviction and sentencing are a very tragic step backwards and a serious setback in the democratic evolution of the Ukrainian nation. Unless this miscarriage of justice is promptly reversed, the Ukrainian judicial system will stand convicted as an arm of a totalitarian state, and Ukraine could be precluded from furthering its integration into the European community. It is hoped that the anticipated appellate review process within the Ukrainian legal system will swiftly rectify this tragic miscarriage of justice and curtail the geopolitical damage that will inevitably befall Ukraine. It should be remembered that the Tymoshenko conviction is no longer about her but about the future prospects of Ukraine as a democratic society that respects the rule of law &#8212; a just and fair society that the Ukrainian people deserve.</p>

News reports stated that Gaddafi was found in a drainpipe after an attack on his convoy as it fled from Sirte, his hometown. At present, it is unclear if he was then killed in the course of a gunfight or if he was killed once in the hands of his captors. What then appears certain is that his body was stripped to the waist and dragged through the streets.</p>

<p>The application of the law of armed conflict is straightforward here. First, Gaddafi was a legitimate target &#8212; the commander of what remained of the Libyan army. If he died in the course of active hostilities, then, barring the use of illegal weapons, the killing was lawful.</p>

<p>However, if he was captured rather than killed in the course of a firefight, as news reports suggest, then his killing violated a central tenet of the law of armed conflict: protection of the wounded and humane treatment for captured personnel. These obligations attach in either international or non-international armed conflict; to prisoners of war or to enemy fighters who do not merit such status. Equally important, in either case, the fighters who desecrated his body and dragged it around &#8212; in celebration of the end of his 42-year reign of terror &#8212; are guilty of war crimes.</p>

<p>These violations have their modern antecedents &#8212; the murder of prisoners of war by both sides in World War II and the scenes of American servicemen being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu in 1993. Few, if any, debate the wrongfulness of these acts &#8212; notwithstanding the nearly universal condemnation of Gaddafi's abusive and repressive tactics &#8212; and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> prohibit both denial of quarter and despoiling the dead.</p>

<p>In the absence of any significant debate regarding the legal principles at issue &#8212; such as the debates that followed the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killing of Osama Bin Laden</a> in May 2011 &#8212; the circumstances of Gaddafi's death provide an opportunity to remind us of the law of armed conflict's ancient and universal pedigree.</p>

<p>For thousands of years, societies around the world have regulated combat in some way, through custom or codes.  From the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/hamcode.asp#text">Code of Hammurabi</a> to the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/india/manu-full.asp">Laws of Manu</a> to the chivalric code, different cultures have mandated protections for certain persons, methods of combat and other regulations. Here, we can look to two of the greatest storytellers in history to find the ancient foundations of the protections trampled upon in Sirte.</p>

<p>First, Homer's <em>Iliad</em> offers some of the bloodiest battle scenes a reader may find, a veritable catalogue of the horrors of war. Yet Homer hints strongly at customs mandating respect for the bodies of the dead, particularly after the great battle between Hector and Achilles. Achilles kills Hector, ties his body to his chariot, and drags it around. The gods, however, protect Hector's body from desecration and Homer's condemnation is stern: "nothing is gained thereby for his good, or his honour." The reader is left with little doubt that Achilles' conduct is dishonorable and violates existing codes of conduct.</p>

<p>Many hundreds of years later, William Shakespeare peppered his plays with allusions to chivalry and the law of war. One famous scene from <em>Henry V</em> is particularly apt. At the Battle of Agincourt, the English have captured a large number of French prisoners. Shaken by the prospect of a new French attack, King Henry issues an order for "every soldier [to] kill his prisoners." The response from Captain Fluellen, one of the King's officers, is scathing: "Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly against the law of arms." Again, the commentary is clear: denial of quarter has no place in the chivalric code.</p>

<p>For both storytellers the customs and laws prohibiting despoliation of the dead and murder of prisoners were fundamental principles to guide behavior during combat. They were, of course, frequently breached, just as today's wars tragically still involve atrocities against civilians and fighters alike. Such violations did not detract from the value or urgency of the law, however, instead highlighting the very need for such legal and moral principles.</p>

<p>No less, neither Homer nor Shakespeare justified such violations on the grounds of necessity or just cause. Thus, Homer and the gods condemned Achilles' treatment of Hector's body even though Hector had killed Patroclus, Achilles' friend and hero. Shakespeare condemns Henry's order even though he issues it ostensibly to help halt the French counterattack. In the same way, the horrors Gaddafi visited on Libyans and non-Libyans alike and the urgency of defeating him and ending his reign of terror in no way justify or excuse the desecration of his body or killing him upon capture.</p>

<p>The modern codified law of war dates back at least 150 years to the <a href="http://www.civilwarhome.com/liebercode.htm">1863 Lieber Code</a>, but it rests on an ancient foundation. The values of honor, mercy and justice, among others, are the forbearers not only of today's detailed rules, but also of the principle of humanity, one of four key principles of the law of war. When this is forgotten, we have Homer and Shakespeare to remind us.</p>

This was met with the acclaim of governments around the world and the relief of the Libyan people. Apparently injured during a combined NATO aircraft and US Predator drone strike on his convoy in Sirte, Gaddafi was then captured by National Transitional Council (NTC) rebels and subsequently killed. Reports from NTC officials also confirmed Gaddafi's son Muatassim was killed in Sirte.</p>

<p>It has been a continuing political and legal trend to kill, rather than capture, those suspected of terrorism. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama Bin Laden</a>, this trend has been strongly influencing international responses to terrorism as well as that in the US. Significantly, on May 16, 2011, the UK House of Commons indicated that the Bin Laden killing portends not only US trends, but also an emergent international political and operational orientation towards intractable terrorist regimes and individuals. The House of Commons Library recently prepared a <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05967">report</a> charting future politico-military and legal approaches to terrorism, noting that Bin Laden's "targeted killing" had "significant implications" for how the US and other countries deal with terrorist suspects. Such methods could be seen to be "accepted politically," it argues, with a trend in customary international law emerging with the "wider implication ... that the killing may be seen as a precedent for targeted killings of individuals by any state, across international boundaries, at least where terrorism is involved. The more states act in this way, the more likely it is to become accepted, at least politically if not as a matter of international law." This trend towards killing instead of capturing following the death of Bin Laden is seen in the targeted killings of <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">Anwar al-Awlaqi</a>, Samir Khan, Ibrahim al-Bana and Al Abdul-Rahman al-Awlaqi.</p>

<p>The forces targeting Gaddafi acted under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII of the UN Charter</a>, using force under the guise of <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm#Resolution">UN Security Council Resolution 1973</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10389.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 2009</a> rather than seeking prosecution using warrant-based targeting to bring terrorists to justice before a domestic tribunal or the International Criminal Court (ICC). The UN-authorized <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">intervention in Libya</a> allowed UN member states to "take all necessary measures ... to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya." Much of the over $1 billion invested by the US in Operation Odyssey Dawn missions have been used to carry out 7,725 air sorties. This is including more than 145 predator drone strikes, such as the ones on Gaddafi's convoy that set the conditions for his demise. This brought to fruition what President Ronald Reagan had attempted with the 1986 Operation El Dorado Canyon retaliatory strikes on Libyan command and control structures, which killed Gaddafi's adopted daughter.</p>

<p>Another example of this is the fact that President Obama has authorized nearly four times the number of targeted killings in Pakistan in his first two years in office as President Bush did in his eight years. This trend includes drone strikes and special operations raids. These have increased from 675 covert raids in 2009 to 1,879 so far this year. Pentagon reports have found that approximately 84 to 86 percent of these night raids end without violence. NATO reports further clarify those ambiguous statistics, stating that in such raids, the target is successfully killed or captured 50 to 60 percent of the time.</p>

<p>According to media accounts of attacks, between 1,100 and 1,800 militants have been targeted since 2009. This of course does not account for casualties not involving deaths. Under this escalation of targeted killings, some 1,100 militants and non-combatant civilian deaths may have occurred in Pakistan alone. As conventional US forces begin to draw down and redeploy to their home stations from Iraq and Afghanistan, "the role of counterterrorism operations, and in particular these kinds of special missions, will become prominent," according to International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) commander General John Allen.</p>

<p>The way ahead seems distantly removed from the peaceful deposing of dictators, as has occurred during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a>. Extensive tracking, investigation and a lengthy trials process for trying tyrants and terrorists may be supplanted by the trend of foreign intervention, targeted killings and domestic extrajudicial sanctions, as was seen with Osama Bin Laden's death and those that followed. Who will be next in this cycle of expedient justice?</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> of Webster University and the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, says the killing of Muammar Gaddafi appears to be another violation of international law involving the US, sending the dangerous message that one must kill or be killed...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/curtis_doebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>lthough the facts are far from clear, most reports now seem to confirm that <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">Muammar Gaddafi was killed</a> after his convoy was attacked by NATO planes, including aircraft from the US and France, and after he was captured alive. If these facts are correct, they point to yet another serious violation of international law involving the US.</p>

<p>The willful killing or summary execution of a prisoner of war who is no longer participating in an armed conflict is a grave breach of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e63bb/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68">Third Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War</a> of 1949, to which both France and the US are parties. It makes no difference how much one dislikes the particular prisoner of war. The resulting obligation for all parties to this treaty is that they investigate, arrest and punish the perpetrators of such crimes.</p>

<p>Of course, the Third Geneva Convention applies mainly during international armed conflicts. The armed conflict in Libya, however, had undoubtedly become international once NATO intervened. It makes no difference in this classification that the intervention was based on a UN Security Council resolution. Indeed, international humanitarian law applies to any international armed conflict, even an illegal one. If one of the domestic parties to a non-international armed conflict becomes an ally of a foreign power and commences fighting against its own people as NATO-led rebels, these rebels could be under enough control from foreign powers so as to make the foreign powers responsible for their acts. </p>

<p>There is evidence that this was the case when Gaddafi was killed. More would have to be known, but the mere fact that Gaddafi's convoy was first attacked by foreign air power and then by ground forces that, according to some reports, included foreign troops is quite telling evidence. Moreover, if as it looks, Gaddafi was fleeing Sirte, it would appear that he was attacked not as a threat to any civilians in Libya, the remit of the use of force provided by the UN Security Council resolution, but either as part of an indiscriminate attack or one aimed at killing people fleeing from an armed conflict. In either case, it would be a use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of Libya, especially given the fact that the NATO-led rebels had expressly stated they do not form a new government of Libya. Such an attack, as had been going on for months, constitutes the crime of aggression. Such an attack, outside the remit of the mandate of the UN Security Council, which itself is bound by international law, also constitutes a serious violation of one of the most fundamental principles of international law prohibiting the use of force. </p>

<p>International human rights law applies as well. This law applies during wartime or peacetime. It imposes a higher standard than in an armed conflict, limiting lawful force to what is absolutely necessary to achieve a lawful goal. In this case, the use of air power and then anti-aircraft guns on land-based persons &#8212; a trademark of the NATO-led rebels throughout the armed conflict &#8212; would very likely constitute excessive force in violation of the right to life. In any event, the summary execution of a prisoner would clearly violate the right to life.</p>

<p>If the rule of international law were respected, the offending states would be required to return the situation to that which existed before their violation began, which is impossible now that Gaddafi has been killed. In killing Gaddafi, the US may have won short term bragging rights as victor in a minor battle against yet another disabled foe, but in the long term the US may have further damaged its global relationships and influence.</p>

<p>Under international law, other states may seek to use the US or another NATO country's international law violations as justification for their internationally wrongful acts. While international law does put limits on the unlawful acts that other states may take in response to the US violation of international law, there are no limits on lawful action that may be taken, such as steps to devalue the US currency, boycotting American products or merely starting to treat Americans as untrustworthy partners in the international community, any of which could have lasting negative consequences for Americans.</p>

<p>Months of acts of aggression culminating in an extrajudicial execution sends a message to other countries, and even non-state actors, who find the US or any of its NATO allies to be a foe is that one must kill or be killed. This is the rule of the jungle, not of international law. Perhaps by his death, Muammar Gaddafi will ultimately haunt his foes longer than he ever could in life. His foes will only have themselves to blame.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/about-us/staff/gabor-rona/">Gabor Rona</a>, International Legal Director of <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a>, argues that the death of Muammar Gaddafi may constitute a war crime under international standards and represents multiple missed opportunities for true justice by the parties involved...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/gaborrona.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he single most important organizing principle of the law of armed conflict is the principle of distinction, which is commonly understood to permit the use of force against combatants and prohibit the use of force against civilians. As the head of Libya's armed forces during an <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">armed conflict</a>, Muammar Gaddafi was certainly a legitimate military target. But once disarmed and taken into custody, combatants, whether they are foot soldiers or commanders-in-chief, are entitled to the same protection as civilians against targeting and ill treatment. Due to this, the circumstances of <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">Gaddafi's death</a> appear to suggest that he was murdered.<br />
                <br />
                The UN Security Council had already referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Had Gaddafi survived, he could have found himself answering charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in The Hague, providing a powerful object lesson on the reach of international justice. Libya could have also offered to constitute its own trial for Gaddafi in accordance with international standards of due process, permitting the ICC to stand down. That would have been an equally powerful object lesson on the complementary relationship between international and domestic judicial processes for international crimes. Either way, a deliberate and credible trial would have been the venue for truth and accountability and perhaps even reconciliation among competing interests.<br />
                <br />
                Instead, what we appear to have gotten is hot-blooded retribution. The National Transitional Council (NTC) had one chance to bring Gaddafi to justice, and they blew it.<br />
                <br />
                In death, Gaddafi has inflicted a well-deserved wound on the NTC, fueling international unease about its willingness and ability to comply with international human rights and humanitarian law rules and principles. One might be tempted to respond that Gaddafi's murder, if that is what it was, is unfortunate but in war stuff happens. It is precisely because stuff happens in war that parties to armed conflict must take the measures necessary to assure that their fighters understand the rules and what can happen when they disobey them. Did the NTC command take measures to inform its fighters that Gaddafi should not be harmed if captured alive? That to do otherwise would constitute a war crime for which they would be held accountable? These and other questions surrounding the Gaddafi's death should be the subject of investigation. If violations of the laws of war are found, including by commanders, those responsible should be held accountable through a legitimate judicial process. The NTC should commit itself to such a process not only because it is the right and legal thing to do, but also as a matter of self-interest in order to begin the process of establishing its bona fides as a responsible, rights-respecting member of the international community that enforces Libya's treaty obligations.</p>

                <p>As an American, I would also like to register regret that the President of the United States saw fit to address the nation upon Gaddafi's death in terms that can be construed, at best, as neutral on the manner of Gaddafi's demise. As a party to the Libyan armed conflict, the US bears a special responsibility under the laws of war not only to respect the rules, but to ensure that they are respected. President Obama's failure to note that Gaddafi's death was likely a war crime, and to call for investigation and accountability, is more than a missed opportunity to affirm the rule of law in war. It is a missed opportunity to affirm what the US stands for. </p>

She, of course, was referring to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">violent death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi</a>. She completely dismissed any calls for justice; there were no declarations by her or any other Western interventionist to honor due process within the rule of law. It almost seemed as if nothing else mattered beyond the US claimed success.</p>

                <p>Sparked by protests in Tunisia, dictatorial leaders in the region are being removed through unprecedented peaceful protest despite responses of regimes like those in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> which respond by brutally imprisoning, torturing and murdering populations that want change. These demonstrations are not purely for democracy. They are being waged in hopes of changing an inequitable and unjust system, one that gives no rights to the individuals who want a voice in their future, be it economic, political or legal.</p>

                <p>The West, and in particular the US Secretary of State, is missing this important point which is necessary if we are to ensure progress that is for the people, by the people in these countries. Instead Clinton did not waste time celebrating Gaddafi's murder. Following her lead, television outlets seemed overjoyed at the ability to parade the bloody, shirtless and seemingly deceased Gaddafi all over the airwaves. Adding drama to insult and injury, anchors did not quit. "Did they pull him out of a hole?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked the Libyan Ambassador to the US over and over again. American soldiers would be in jail for that behavior, but not American leadership. They applaud those responsible for Gaddafi's cruel death. It is exceedingly surreal.</p>

                <p>Of course, it is the right of the Libyan people to rejoice in their newfound "freedom," which will hopefully turn into some semblance of order with civil, economic, democratic and judicial progress. It is not however responsible or acceptable for world leaders to mock someone's gruesome demise. From the Secretary of State on down, Senators and Republican presidential candidates took pleasure in American hegemony and the loss of life, apparently oblivious to the grisly pictures. Senator John McCain (R-AZ), a former prisoner of war who should by all counts know better, went so far as to put the leaders of Iran, Syria and even China on notice telling them they should not test American resolve because they could be next.</p>

                <p>Instead of embracing engagement and robust diplomacy, the US seems to be too content with its excessive use of military power and coercive statecraft. Rule of law or just basic self-respect are secondary.</p>

                <p>Like him or not, Gaddafi, like <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saddam+Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, believed that the US supported him in more ways than arms and oil exploration. Gaddafi gave up his nuclear program, although it was fairly nonexistent, and energy credits to normalize relations at the insistence of one American president only to find himself the literal target of another.</p>

                <p>"We hope he can be captured or killed soon," spouted Clinton, basically calling on the Libyan people to assassinate a leader who ruled for over 40 years. At the forefront of this war was the administration's call for the "responsibility to protect." In Gaddafi's case though, he apparently did not deserve protection or trial. In all too many eyes, protection is sadly afforded to some but not "others" &#8212; putting little room between the administration and the dictator they deposed.</p>

                <p>The world has shockingly become a society that favors some human life over others, blinding us all to brutality and outright murder. True, there are people that are criminals, but this is why there is the rule of law. As the Arab world embraces civil rights and democracy, it would do better to learn to honor the very rights that it is fighting for. As for the US, it must get serious about spreading human rights across the board.</p>

                <p>This incessant need to create a foreign policy based on force must change. In July of this year, the Pew Global Attitudes Project reported that "in Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan, the belief that Americans and Europeans are hostile has become more common since 2006." The US call for, and then subsequent reaction to, the Gaddafi's death does little to counter this impression. The only way to respond to such a dishonorable sense of who Americans are is for this and every US administration to conduct foreign policy by holding steadfast to its own beliefs in democracy and the rule of law for all people &#8212; and this, like it or not, includes dictators.</p>

		<title>Unintended Consequences: Gaddafi&amp;apos;s Death and the Arab Spring</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Jordan Toone, <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/">University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law</a> Class of 2012, has spent over two years working and studying in the Middle East, including six months as an embedded civilian social scientist with the First Armored Division in Baghdad, Iraq. He writes about some of the unintended consequences Muammar Gaddafi's death may have on the Arab Spring and US foreign policy in the Middle East...<hr height='1'><strong>T</strong>he <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">death of Muammar Gaddafi</a>, Libya's longtime strongman, was a startling end to his 42-year rule and a poignant punctuation to the region's ongoing revolutions. The death of Gaddafi &#8212; the Arab world's longest-serving leader and self-anointed "King of Kings" &#8212; not only constitutes a major victory for the people of Libya, but serves as a graphic reminder that no Arab leader, regardless of power, prestige or resources, is immune to the wave of discontent that has rippled across the region. </p>

<p>Yet, as with most recent socio-political developments in the Middle East, the effects of Gaddafi's death are not as black and white as many observers are likely inclined to conclude, and, for several reasons, it may ultimately work to stifle the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a> and further complicate US efforts to promote stability and peace in the region.  </p>

<p>To begin with, Western intervention introduced a foreign dimension into what was otherwise an Arab-only, grassroots demonstration of popular will &#8212; an unprecedented development in modern Libyan history. Much has been written surrounding the controversial decision by the US and NATO to intervene militarily in Libya. To be sure, Gaddafi may still be in power had Western powers refrained from intervening militarily; and, by the same token, the argument can be made that the threat of Western involvement &#8212; military or otherwise &#8212; has facilitated and will continue to facilitate other revolutions in the region. Yet, even if it is accepted that Western intervention was necessary to depose Gaddafi, such intervention can be seen as truncating, or at least corrupting, a manifestation of the very thing Western intervention was meant to protect &#8212; namely, self-determination via popular will leading to a representative government. No doubt such trade-offs were contemplated in Brussels, Paris and Washington, DC leading up to the decision to intervene in Libya; yet, for better or worse, the upshot of Western intervention in Libya is that the Arab Spring is no longer totally Arab.  </p>

<p>While time will tell whether the introduction of foreign elements into Libya's national liberation process will impact Libya's constitutional, political and socioeconomic development, one thing is certain; the effects of Western intervention in Libya and the resulting death of Gaddafi will be felt across the region. Most scholars writing on Western intervention and Gaddafi's death have warned of the dangerous precedent that Gaddafi's death &#8212; facilitated, if not caused, by US and French military intervention &#8212; will set in an ever volatile region. While no doubt a dangerous implication, this argument misjudges the reality on the ground, which is that not only is it highly unlikely that the US public would be able to stomach another intervention, but the likelihood that Russia and China, as permanent members of the UN Security Council, would consent to such intervention is next to impossible, as they have made clear in the UN Security Council negotiations surrounding possible intervention in Syria. The danger arising from Gaddafi's death is that given the global controversy surrounding Western intervention in Libya and Western powers' role in the death of Gaddafi, additional intervention is in fact less likely. This thereby emboldens remaining dictators in their quest to hang on to power. Iran and Syria, for example, know that Gaddafi's death and the circumstances surrounding it simply add to an already long list of barriers that work to significantly diminish the likelihood of further Western intervention in the Middle East, giving both countries additional leverage in their confrontations with the international community. </p>

<p>The more proximate danger associated with military intervention in Libya and the resulting death of Gaddafi is that it fosters the false impression among Arab protesters in Bahrain, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere that their efforts may always be supplemented by Western force. Such an expectation is understandable. After all, if the US is willing to intervene in Libya, a country that had actively sought to improve its relations with the West in the previous two decades, then why would the US not also intervene in Syria, home to an anti-Israel, pro-Iran, Arab strongman intent on developing nuclear weapons? For American observers, the answer is complicated, but nonetheless legitimate and understandable: intervention would be difficult to obtain due to lack of international support; intervention in Syria would implicate far more dangerous scenarios, possibly including Israel and Iran; the opposition in Syria is not as organized or well-equipped militarily; and intervention in Syria could have dangerous spill-over effects in Iraq. Nonetheless, such answers are unsatisfactory to the Arab street, and add to the long list of "double standard" allegations already hampering US efforts in the region. In this sense, US intervention and Gaddafi's death may actually work to diminish the influence of the US on the Arab Spring.</p>

<p>Whether or not further Western intervention in the region is likely, Gaddafi's death will also work to embolden remaining dictators &#8212; in the Middle East and elsewhere &#8212; in their quest to hold onto power. In the minds of regional dictators, if Gaddafi &#8212; the "mad dog of the Middle East" who, since the Lockerbie bombing and the Reagan administration's hardline stance on Libya, had transformed himself into the poster child of carrot-and-stick diplomacy &#8212; could be taken out, then what would prevent the US from targeting less cooperative regimes? No doubt the images and videos of a bloodied Gaddafi &#8212; harassed and abused by Libyan rebels &#8212; that were broadcast around the world struck a chord with the region's dictators. This fact is especially troubling in regards to dictators with nuclear aspirations or capabilities, including, presumably, the theocratic regime in Iran and the Alawi regime in Syria. Gaddafi's death has reinforced these dictators' beliefs that nuclear technology is a deterrent, especially in light of how poorly Gaddafi fared only a few years after succumbing to Western pressure to abandon his nuclear program. Alternatively, dictators or theocrats such as Assad or Khamenei who, intent on holding onto power, will increasingly look to China and Russia to fortify strategic relations. Suffice it to say, Gaddafi's death has added several daunting sand traps to the stifling par five being played by US policymakers trying to navigate the always-difficult Middle East course.</p>

<p>Following Western intervention in Libya, the regimes in Damascus and Tehran are also eager to criticize Western intervention in Libya as a violation of Libya's sovereignty, as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did recently in an interview with CNN. This is worth noting only because prior to Western intervention in Libya, many of the Arab World's dictators seemed much more inclined to respond to their citizens' demands and, in fact, encouraged other Middle Eastern leaders to do likewise. During the height of the Tahrir demonstrations in Cairo, for example, President Ahmadinejad, presumably speaking on behalf of the Iranian regime, urged Mubarak to respect the demands of his citizens. King Abdullah recently instituted notable steps to further women's rights in Saudi Arabia, in addition to announcing $37 billion in benefits to low and middle income Saudis. President Assad has also made conciliatory gestures to his people during the Syrian demonstrations of the past few months. Today, however, following Western involvement in Gaddafi's death, the rhetoric coming out of Tehran, Damascus and, to a lesser extent Riyadh, has returned to its familiar tune with its focus on the misdoings of the West rather than the plethora of problems facing them at home. The tragic upshot of all of this is that public discourse, at least in the Arab world, has turned from the remarkable and ongoing achievements of the Arab Spring to Western interventionism, thereby working to truncate, or at least distract from, the revolutions currently taking place in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere. </p>

<p>Another unsavory consequence of Gaddafi's death is that it comes at a time when the US is quietly navigating a labyrinth of weighty foreign policy decisions, all of which seem, in one way or another, to involve Iran. Placing Gaddafi's death in the context of these increasingly complex regional developments highlights several difficulties facing US policy in the region. </p>

<p>First, Gaddafi's death coincides with international attempts led by the US to pressure Iran into abandoning its quest for weapon-grade nuclear technology. The UN-approved, US-NATO intervention in Libya does nothing to strengthen Iran's relationship with NATO, which is already rocky due to NATO's missile shield plan in Turkey. Nor does Western intervention in Libya and the resulting death of Gaddafi work to foster trust between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If anything, Gaddafi's death encourages Iran to further limit its cooperation with the international community. Western intervention in Libya and the resulting death of Gaddafi, also coincide with Ayatollah Khamenei's recent announcement that the position of the president in Iran is indispensable. While no doubt a result of ongoing hostility between President Ahmadinejad, the Parliament and the Supreme Leader, Khamenei's announcement in the days before Gaddafi's death raises the question of whether he is simply attempting to remove what would otherwise be one of the few legitimate targets for public dissatisfaction in Iran in the manner witnessed in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. If this were true, Gaddafi's death would only fortify Khamenei's thinking.</p>

<p>With regard to regional politics, Gaddafi's death comes at a time when Iranian influence in the Middle East has reached unprecedented levels. Iranian influence has never been stronger, not only in the so-called Shi'a Crescent (Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Bahrain), but, increasingly, in traditionally Sunni territory, including Gaza, Qatar and Oman. Former foes of Iran have either been toppled or are facing domestic unrest. Unlike years past, the governments of Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen are "in play" for Iran. Iran's principle antagonist in its quest for regional supremacy is, of course, Saudi Arabia. Although both countries have experienced recent episodes of domestic unrest, both find themselves relatively unscathed by the Arab Spring and eager to exert their influence on the region in what is essentially a "proxy war" between the two adversaries. As the US has failed &#8212; again &#8212; to initiate any meaningful developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and as new or recently established governments feel less inclined to affiliate with Washington, Iran eagerly attempts to fill the void. Nowhere is this more evident than in Iraq, where the Iranian-backed factions of the Iraqi government continue to exert remarkable influence, evidenced most recently by the Government of Iraq's refusal to extend the timeframe for the withdrawal of US troops from the country.</p>

<p>So how does the Arab Spring and, specifically, Gaddafi's death play into all of this? President Obama recently stated that the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and killing of Gaddafi signify a resurgence of American leadership. At least for many Arabs, President Obama is mistaken. If anything, Gaddafi's death reinforces long-held inclinations among Middle Eastern leaders that Washington cannot be trusted. The old regimes have become wary of Washington, while the new governments want to start on their own two feet, free from foreign intervention. For leaders in the Middle East, the death of Gaddafi stands as a cogent reminder that cooperation with the West does not guarantee anything. Such a reality opens the door to increased Iranian influence in the region, and does little to diffuse the increasing tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The result may well be that the Arab Spring will take back seat to the Saudi-Iranian dispute with Iraq &#8212; much to the fear of the US &#8212; being the principal pawn.</p>

<p>Overall, besides being a historic achievement in the history of Libya and, indeed, the Arab World, Gaddafi's death introduces several challenges that may ultimately work to undermine the development of the Arab Spring and US policy in the region. The Obama administration can mitigate some of these challenges by continuing to support &#8212; economically, politically, and diplomatically, as opposed to using force &#8212; the Arab Spring, while concomitantly seeking to reevaluate aspects of US policy in the Middle East that, unfortunately, overshadow the otherwise positive, commendable and meaningful contributions made by America in the Middle East and throughout the world.</p>

He writes on the implications of the Eight Circuit's decision in <em>Brady v. NFL</em>...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/erickposser.png" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he plaintiffs in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10260430280729785179">Brady v. National Football League</a> are nine professional football players and one prospective professional football player, who have been or seek to be employed by the NFL. The plaintiffs filed suit on behalf of themselves and similarly situated players seeking a declaratory judgment, damages and injunctive relief. They also seek to enjoin the NFL owners from locking the players out, which would prohibit players from entering NFL club facilities, receiving compensation or benefits, performing any employment duties, making promotional appearances and consulting medical and training personnel.</p>

<p>On March 11, 2011, as the deadline approached for negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement and stipulation and settlement agreement, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) notified the NFL that it would decertify as a union, effectively disclaiming its interest as the players' collective bargaining representative. The NFL responded by filing an amended unfair labor practice claim with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), asserting that the NFLPA's decertification was a "sham" and that the decertification coupled with subsequent litigation was an unlawful subversion of the collective bargaining process. </p>

<p>Responding directly to the NLRB claim, the players commenced the instant action in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota, asserting multiple claims against the NFL. First, they argued that the non-statutory labor exemption does not apply to the instant case because the players were no longer represented by the NFLPA and, accordingly, no longer had a collective bargaining relationship with the NFL. Second, they claimed that the NFL's planned lockout was an illegal boycott and price-fixing arrangement that violated &#167; 1 of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/divisionmanual/chapter2.pdf">Sherman Act</a>." [PDF] Third, they purported that the planned lockout violated state contract and tort laws. Finally, they alleged that the NFL planned to continue or institute anticompetitive practices in violation of the Sherman Act.</p>

<p>Hearing the case on appeal, the opinion of the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit began by considering whether the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) deprived the district court of jurisdiction to enjoin the NFL lockout. The court indicated that Congress was intent upon largely taking the federal courts out of the labor injunction business with the exception of a few circumstances spelled out in the NLRA. Although the impetus for the NLRA was dissatisfaction with injunctions entered against workers in labor disputes, the statute also requires that injunctions against an employer participating in a labor dispute conform to the NLRA. Thus, the first issue to be decided was whether the NLRA provided jurisdiction for the district court's injunction, or whether the matter was to be decided by the NLRB.</p>

<p>The district court previously <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9616321846245524364&">held</a> that federal jurisdiction was proper and enjoined the NFL from locking out the players. Ultimately, the court found that the NLRB did not deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction because <em>Brady</em> did not involve or grow out of a "labor dispute." The Eighth Circuit, however, found that pursuant to the definition of labor dispute provided in &#167; 13(c) of the act, the case did involve or grow out of a labor dispute. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has observed the statutory definition of labor dispute to be extremely broad and congressional intent suggests that the NLRA's scope was to be far-reaching. As such, the Eighth Circuit held that this was a controversy concerning terms of employment, and that the players sought broad relief that would impact the terms or conditions of employment for the entire industry of professional football. In particular, the Eighth Circuit disagreed with the district court's conclusion that this was a dispute over commodities rather than a controversy over terms and conditions of employment.</p>

<p>The Eighth Circuit further held that while &#167; 13(a) does not provide the operative definition of labor dispute; its requirements were, nevertheless, fulfilled, as the dispute involved persons engaged in the same industry. Accordingly, it found that the district court improperly departed from the text of &#167; 13(a) when it found the provision to require that employees be unionized. The Eighth Circuit refused to add such a requirement of unionization, holding that employees may engage in activities for the purpose of mutual aid or protection without the existence of a union, and that lawsuits resulting from such activities can be deemed to involve or grow out of labor disputes. Therefore, the fact that the player's union decertified in order to pursue antitrust litigation did not impact the finding of a pre-existing, or ongoing, labor dispute for purposes of the NLRA.  </p>

<p>The Eighth Circuit's conclusion that the preliminary injunction did not conform to the provisions set forth in the NLRA was a limited holding that highlighted the importance of collective bargaining between the NFL and the players. Seemingly, the Eighth Circuit decided <em>Brady</em> through a narrow, textual-based determination of the applicability of the NLRA to the facts of the instant case. Despite the court's strict, textual analysis, the opinion does contain some weaknesses.</p>

<p>In its decision, while the Eighth Circuit analyzed the intent of Congress in creating the NLRA, it failed to fully analyze the legislative history. As the dissent points out, the legislative history reveals House of Representatives committee reports that discuss goals of protecting labor rights and defeating attempts at employer protection. This is essentially the crux of the players' argument that the act only extends protection to employees, not employers. This case did pose potentially severe implications for the NFL. If the court affirmed the injunction, the NFL owners would have been forced to operate their organizations and honor players' contracts with no collective bargaining agreement in place. Thus, it is possible that the repercussions of finding the federal courts to have jurisdiction weighed into the court's decision and drove the strict, textual analysis. </p>

<p>Moreover, the Eighth Circuit expressed no view on the scope of the non-statutory labor exemption that posed a potential obstacle to the success of the players' antitrust claim. Unfortunately, the court only spoke to the narrow issue on appeal, regarding the scope of the NLRA. This left the issue of whether the players' antitrust lawsuit would have withheld the protection offered by the labor exemption unanswered.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit's textual analysis of the NLRA was correct and its conclusions justified within the text of the statute. First, the facts in <em>Brady</em> reasonably lead to the conclusion that the two parties were involved in a case growing out of or involving a labor dispute. The lawsuit and the collective bargaining prior to the filing of the lawsuit concerned the terms and conditions of the players' employment. It was also reasonable to conclude from the text and precedent that there is no requirement that employees be unionized in order for a labor dispute to occur. Given that both parties have been under a collective bargaining relationship for the past 18 years, the fact that the players chose to pursue antitrust laws over collective bargaining did not erase their labor relationship with the league.</p>

<p>In general, the Eighth Circuit came to the correct conclusion by vacating the district court's decision to enjoin the NFL lockout. Seemingly, the court erred in ignoring the legislative history of the NLRA, which provided some interesting insight and difficult obstacles for the court to overcome. Yet the decision to stand by the express language of the NLRA and analyze the scope of the statute under a strict, textual interpretation led to the most reasonable resolution in <em>Brady</em>. There were many implications posed by this labor dispute that would have impacted each individual member and organization of the NFL. By vacating the injunction and upholding the lockout, it is fair to assume that the court decided the proper forum for curing these issues was the negotiation table, not the federal courtroom.</p>

<p>The Eighth Circuit's decision in <em>Brady</em> is a significant development in the law surrounding professional sports. The decision is especially important because it stands to impact all future labor disputes between professional sports leagues and players' unions, including the current lockout taking place in the National Basketball Association. Although there is criticism that the Eighth Circuit's opinion is too narrow, the decision comes as no surprise to the legal community. Furthermore, <em>Brady</em> can even be viewed as a positive holding for both parties involved.</p>

<p>For the NFL, <em>Brady</em> was a major victory and validation of its legal strategy. First, <em>Brady</em> upheld the use of lockouts for employers as a means of pressuring employees into accepting terms in collective bargaining. Going forward, every professional sports league will likely rely on <em>Brady</em> when locking out their players during a collective bargaining impasse. Second, the NFL successfully eliminated the injunction, the players' biggest weapon and collective bargaining chip. As a result, the players were left to decide between either continuing to pursue the merits of their antitrust claim or caving into various demands from the owners and settling on a new collective bargaining agreement. Ultimately, this decision was an easy one for the players because an antitrust trial would have resulted in years of costly litigation. This would have been unfavorable as the players would have lost significant compensation, suffered from diminishing skills and come up against the Eight Circuit a second time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <em>Brady</em> does offer some benefits for the players in future labor disputes. Primarily, the Eighth Circuit does not speak on the merits of the players' antitrust claims, leaving the option open going forward. Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit suggested in oral arguments that the non-statutory labor exemption ends within six months to a year. Thus, the players were able to pressure the owners with the prospect of an antitrust suit, gaining some collective bargaining leverage that allowed for a quick settlement and more favorable terms in the new collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p>In conclusion, <em>Brady</em> brought a return to football and potentially an end to some professional sports related litigation. Neutral arbitrators, not judicial oversight, will resolve future labor disputes between the NFL and the NFLPA. Although <em>Brady</em> seems to be a narrow opinion on its face, the Eighth Circuit essentially saved the 2011 NFL season and allowed for both parties to resolve their differences around the negotiation table.</p>

Millions rejoiced and took to the streets in celebration. Some were simply disgusted. Others worried about what it all meant for Libya and for justice. Indeed, the reactions to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">death of Muammar Gaddafi</a> have been remarkably mixed and contradictory. In particular, there has been a vast gulf between those who see Gaddafi's killing as having finally served justice to a man who reigned, at times brutally, over his police state and those who viewed his killing as a concerning demonstration of injustice. Perhaps even more worrying is the reality that, rather than being exceptional, Gaddafi's killing is part of an increasingly acknowledged trend, which may challenge not only international law, but the nature of justice itself. </p>

                <p>Numerous scholars, diplomats, human rights activists and lawyers often proclaim that we live in a world where impunity is outdated. This high rhetoric represents the belief that international criminals, including heads of states who perpetrate war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, have no place to hide. Even if they escape justice now, accountability will catch up with them eventually. </p>

                <p>Kathryn Sikkink, for example, recently published <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Justice-Cascade">The Justice Cascade</a>, wherein she argues that we have been in the midst of a tectonic normative change in how the world deals with human rights abuses and international crimes. Today, Sikkink argues, the world expects that leaders who abuse their people will be held to account. That is the conclusion we should draw, according to Sikkink, from the experiences of Argentina's junta trials, the <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/pinochet-indicted-on-human-rights.php">indictment of Pinochet</a>, and from seeing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Slobodan+Milosevic+trial">Slobodan Milosevic in the dock</a>. Does Sikkink's notion of a "justice cascade" represent an accurate reflection of the way the world is or is it instead a form of talking norms into reality?</p>

                <p>It is worth wondering whether part of the reason so many observers were so shocked by Gaddafi's death was because they believed in the justice cascade. Surely if a justice cascade existed, Gaddafi would have been presented alive, in front of his victims, in a cold courtroom, rather than dead, his corpse lying half-naked in a cold storage container.</p>

                <p>Indeed, it seems that the belief in a settled norm where leaders who commit international crimes are held legally accountable is an expression of hope of where international politics could go, rather than a reflection of where it actually is. Shaping the belief that a norm of international accountability exists is a selection bias in the narratives of transitional justice. For example, most studies tend to look at only one type of mechanism, with criminal prosecutions being by far the most popular. The result is that much greater attention has been paid to the fact that leaders like Pinochet and Milosevic sat in the docks of international tribunals, than to the fact that the use of amnesty laws to protect perpetrators of human rights violations has actually <a href="http://www.gsdrc.org/go/display&type=Document&id=2885">increased</a> in recent years.</p>

                <p>Remarkably, it was not until 2010 that the first truly comprehensive quantitative analysis of various transitional justice mechanisms was produced. The conclusions drawn from the <a href="http://www.usip.org/events/book-launch">study</a> by Tricia Olsen, Leigh Payne and Andrew Reiter run in direct contradiction to what many have for so long believed. They demonstrate evidence that the use of trials with amnesties has a positive effect on democratization and respect for human rights and that when taking into account the increased number of national transitions from violent autocracy to peaceful democracy, the frequency of trials has not actually changed at all. </p>

                <p>The extent to which expectations were created that Gaddafi would face his day at the International Criminal Court (ICC) masked the reality that his killing was, unfortunately, no surprise. Nor was the fact that his death was called "justice" surprising. Killing Gaddafi only comes as a shock if we are blind to the trends that suggest that killing Gaddafi and calling it justice was not unlikely. It is worth remembering that following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">assassination of Osama Bin Laden</a>, President Barack Obama declared that anyone who questioned whether Bin Laden's killing was just "should get their head checked."</p>

                <p>In his thoughtful and thought-provoking article for JURIST, <a href="/forum/2011/10/kevin-govern-gaddafi-killing.php">Kevin Govern laid out an emerging trend</a> wherein "extensive tracking, investigation and a lengthy trial process for trying tyrants and terrorists may be supplanted by the trend of foreign intervention, targeted killings and domestic extrajudicial sanctions of foreign intervention, targeted killings and domestic extrajudicial sanctions." The proof is in the pudding; the killing of individuals like Bin Laden and Gaddafi, as well as the dramatic increase in the use of drone strikes by the US, is symptomatic of a shift in practice towards eliminating enemies rather than ensuring they face justice in front of judges.</p>

                <p>Scholars, pundits and diplomats can debate ad nauseam that the Bin Laden assassination is not the same as the Gaddafi killing, which is not the same as using drones. They would be right &#8212; they are not the same. However, they do have two troubling key elements in common: first, they suggest an increasing practice of eliminating inconvenient enemies by killing them; and second, they have been framed as just and necessary acts. </p>

                <p>A remarkable feature of the "<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a>" was the demonstration that a region of the world not known for being a champion of international criminal justice was speaking in the language of accountability, respect for human rights and the rule of law. More recently, however, hopes for justice and accountability have been challenged on a fundamental level. The fact is that killing leaders like Gaddafi is in direct contradiction to what international criminal law and justice attempt to do. Such acts are in contravention of any possible "justice cascade." Not only does killing remove the possibility of such leaders ever being held legally to account for their crimes, but framing Gaddafi and Bin Laden's deaths, among others, as justice brings the "justice" served by assassinating and killing enemies into the same moral space as the "justice" served by holding individuals to account by trial.  </p>

                <p>The palpable trend of killing adversaries rather than bringing them to account in front of a panel of judges, whether in The Hague or elsewhere, presents perhaps the most significant normative challenge to the possibility of living in a world where international criminal justice is the rule and not the exception. For some this may be painting a picture a few shades too stark. My premise is rather simple; to ensure that legal accountability becomes the new norm, advocates of international justice need to stop talking about the world in which they wish we lived and start dealing with the shortcomings and injustices of the one in which we do live. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.wethenet.eu/about/lauteur/">F&#233;lix Tr&#233;guer</a>, Policy and Legal Analyst at <a href="http://www.laquadrature.net/">La Quadrature du Net</a>, says that the recent ruling blocking the Copwatch website in France is just another instance of censorship under the Sarkozy government which prevents French citizens from learning of police abuse and engaging in democratic governance...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/felixtreguer.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>F</strong></font>or the first time in France, cop-watching has made the headlines nationwide. Such publicity is the result of a groundbreaking case involving the <a href="https://copwatchnord-idf.org/">Copwatch</a> website designed for posting photos, videos and commentaries denouncing police abuse. In late September, the French Minister of the Interior, Claude Gu&#233;ant, charged the authors of Copwatch with defaming, insulting and infringing the privacy of police officers. Following a fast-track procedure, a Paris district court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/france-court-orders-block-on-copwatch-website.php">ruled in favor of the government</a>, declaring Copwatch illegal for several reasons. Faced with the impossibility of ordering the take down of Copwatch &#8212; hosted in the US where cop-watching is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/first-circuit-court-upholds-right-to-record-public-police-action.php">legal</a> &#8212; the judge issued an injunction requiring the immediate blocking of the website by all major French Internet service providers. The authors remain anonymous and did not appear at their trial.  </p>

                <p>By blocking Copwatch, the French government makes its already disastrous record on Internet policy even worse. Over the past two years of Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, the government has created an Internet disconnection sentence through the infamous <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/copyright/procedural-concerns-with-the-hadopi-graduated-response-model">HADOPI laws</a>, which are aimed at tackling the unauthorized sharing of copyrighted works online. Sarkozy's government has also allowed the police to block online content with no judicial oversight, called for the take down of WikiLeaks with no legal basis, passed an executive order forcing hosting platforms to engage in disproportionate data retention practices. It is now seeking broad extra-judicial censorship powers over the Internet on the pretext of protecting public order, national security, public health and consumers. </p>

                <p>The Copwatch case is a controversial and complex one. Indeed, most French people consider that the type of material used to denounce police abuse goes too far. Not only does the website include pictures and videos of police interventions, but it also contains full names and screen shots of police officers' public accounts on social networks. For instance, one of them shows an affiliation with far-right extremist groups on Facebook. In an anonymous interview, one of Copwatch's editors defended this rather aggressive policy, saying that police officers are public officials who represent the republic, and that their right to privacy has to be balanced with citizens' rights to good administration. The government disagreed, and so did the judge. The website was eventually convicted of violations of privacy. </p>

                <p>The government did not stop there, but also successfully charged Copwatch with defaming and insulting police officers &#8212; two criminal offenses under the 1881 <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070722&dateTexte=vig">Law on the Freedom of the Press</a>. According to the ruling, Copwatch's editors were not allowed to insult the police force by saying that it is the "pauper's grave of humanity," nor could they write that the police force of the city of Calais, in Northern France, "trains to hunt migrants, to humiliate them, [and] to torture them psychologically." The judge considered such allegations to be defamatory, and therefore illegal. Even citizens who are not journalists are prohibited from expressing opinions and judgments in the form of peremptory statements or slander against the republic.</p>

                <p>Far from being an isolated instance, the Copwatch case illustrates a pattern. In the past years, we have also seen a former government minister suing a 49-year-old woman for calling the minister a "liar" in the comment section of a video hosting platform, and former Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux &#8212; now special advisor to the president &#8212; bringing legal action against two cop-watching blogs for defaming and insulting police forces. Since Nicolas Sarkozy took office in 2007, the crime of offense to the president has also gone through a revival, as did the charge of "contempt of cop," with a sharp increase in the number of cases and convictions. Last year, after a picture of a man wiping himself with a French flag won a photo contest, the government created a &euro;1500 fine for offense to the flag. Clearly, existing law hampers the ability of citizens to speak their minds &#8212; however bluntly &#8212; about the institutions and power relationships organizing society. </p>

                <p>The blocking of Copwatch thus exhibits a crucial fact about French democracy &#8212; namely that existing law greatly constrains the empowerment of citizens in their relation to the state. While cop-watching typifies a new era in which people are able to use widely available information and communications technologies to make institutions more transparent and accountable, the policies of both the government and the courts run counter to the enjoyment of these new-found capacities.<br />
                    <br />
                    In another revealing case chronicled in the French newspaper <em>Lib&#233;ration</em>, a young man was subject to the disproportionate use of force by two police officers who arrested him for insulting them and refusing to comply with their orders, while one of his friends recorded the whole scene of the arrest on video. Anticipating the reaction of the judge, his lawyer chose not to use the video as evidence and gathered a dozen testimonies from elected city officials, social workers and witnesses of the arrest, all in favor of the young man. The court, however, refused to hear these witnesses. Instead, the judge chastised the defendant for asking his friends to record the scene and criticized the very concept of cop-watching during the trial. The young man lost, and was sentenced to pay &euro;300 to the two police officers for moral prejudice and to a suspended sentence of four months in prison. </p>

                <p>The legal rejection of cop-watching suggests the inability of citizens to participate in uncovering police abuse. It is very unfortunate, especially at a time of tension between the police and the general population, which are extremely perceptible in underserved urban areas. Sarkozy's "tough on crime" rhetoric and policies, while patently ineffective, have ended up aggravating distrust towards the police, which is put under strain by an endless race for statistics to satisfy his political agenda. While trying to stigmatize the critics of the government's law enforcement policy, Gu&#233;ant never even acknowledged the wrongdoings identified on the website.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, the Internet provides the means for resisting censorship. When Gu&#233;ant announced that he was going after Copwatch in late September, people were quick to lambaste his decision on social networks. In a matter of days, dozens of mirror websites replicating the original website appeared on other domain names. In spite of the blocking of Copwatch by French Internet service providers, its content remains widely available through these mirror websites, and it is now benefiting from the viral marketing campaign inadvertently launched by Gu&#233;ant. </p>

                <p>Hence, though the government may have scored a legal victory, it unintentionally started a debate on the virtues of cop-watching. The crucial question for the future of democracy in France is whether the Copwatch case will drive demands for legislative reforms aimed at fostering free speech and empowering citizens in their relation to the republic, or on the contrary, whether the resilience of Copwatch's online presence will push the government to seek ever broader powers to censor the Internet. The answer may lie in the outcome of upcoming the presidential and legislative elections, which will be held in spring 2012.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Senior Editor Sarah Paulsworth, <a href="www.law.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh School of Law</a> Class of 2013, is a Boren Fellow and has lived and worked in Azerbaijan. She writes about the impermissible pressure Azerbaijan's Lawyers' Collegium exerts on independent lawyers who defend dissidents, human rights activists and journalists...<hr height='1'><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he past several months have seen a drastic increase in the amount of pressure exerted on Azerbaijan's small cadre of independent lawyers. These lawyers carry out vital work in Azerbaijan, defending clients that most lawyers in the country loathe, including dissidents, human rights activists and journalists. Furthermore, these individuals are instrumental in facilitating the submission of Azeri citizens' cases to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). These cases have shined an international spotlight on Azerbaijan's manifold human rights violations. As of January 1, 2011, the ECHR issued 42 judgments against Azerbaijan, 38 of which were violation judgments. Another 1,254 cases were still pending against Azerbaijan at the time.</p>

<p>Azerbaijan's Bar Association, also known as the Lawyers' Collegium, is one of the major mechanisms through which Azerbaijan's independent lawyers are harassed. As in most republics of the former Soviet Union, criminal defense in Azerbaijan is monopolized by the Collegium. Pursuant to Article IV, &#167; 1 of Azerbaijan's Law on Lawyers and Lawyerly Activities, only members of the Collegium can participate in "lawyerly activities." These activities are defined in Article IV, &#167; 2 as "defending people accused or convicted of committing a crime, representing people who have filed cassation complaints related to civil cases with the Republic of Azerbaijan's Supreme Court, and representing complainants in cases of alleged rights and freedoms violations before that Republic of Azerbaijan's Constitutional Court." Therefore, lawyers that are the subject of disciplinary action, which results in the temporary or permanent suspension of their Collegium membership, are severely restricted in the scope of their work and completely excluded from filing the appeals typically required to take a case before the ECHR under Article 35, &#167; 1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [PDF].  </p>

<p>If the Lawyers' Collegium were an independent entity that issued objective decisions on disciplinary issues, this would not be problematic. However, the Collegium is closely linked to the will of Azerbaijan's ruling regime. The International League for Human Rights stated in a report published in 1999 that:<blockquote>Although the Ministry of Justice does not micromanage the day-to-day operations, the Collegium leadership knows what is politically acceptable to the Presidential Administration and the Ministry of Justice. The leadership toes the line and ensures that the lawyers it controls stay in line as well. When it does not, a phone call from above can quickly energize the Collegium leadership into action.</blockquote>While the report may appear outdated, it was, however, cited by both the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative in reports published in 2005. Furthermore, the US Department of State (DOS) <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">characterized the Collegium</a> as "government-controlled" in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154413.htm">2010 Human Rights report on Azerbaijan</a>. </p>

<p>On September 16, 2011, Azerbaijan's Lawyers' Collegium adopted a decision to expel lawyer Elchin Namazov. According to the decision issued by the Collegium's Disciplinary Commission, Namazov violated ethical standards in an August 27 hearing in which he acted as defense counsel for several activists, who were arrested earlier in the year during highly contentious protests. During the hearing, Namazov introduced a petition to have the pre-trial detention of his client, Rufat Hajibeyli, replaced with house arrest. After the court refused the request, Namazov introduced a formal protest, claiming that the court was acting in an unjust manner. The court subsequently rejected the protest and an argument broke out in the courtroom. According to Namazov, the court's refusal to even consider the protest contravenes Azeri law. Nonetheless, due to the argument, the judges announced a recess and, upon returning, they declared that a criminal case would be launched against Namazov pursuant to <a href="http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/1215/file/d5b27e504e9c30cec20bd7bb6bce.htm/preview">Article 289 of the Criminal Code</a> for "disrespecting the court." Additionally, the court removed Namazov from the case and initiated proceedings to expel him from the Collegium. Namazov also defended many other high-profile clients, including imprisoned youth activist <a href="/dateline/2011/03/azerbaijan-detention-of-youth-activist-highlights-failure-to-provide-alternative-to-military-service.php">Bakhtiyar Hajiyev</a>, Islamic Party member Haji Zulfigar Mikayilov, who is accused of plotting a coup, and Azer Jabiyev, another religious figure who was convicted of hooliganism involving the use of weapons. Namazov has filed a complaint in court challenging his expulsion.</p>

<p>The Collegium is also currently reviewing a complaint against Aslan Ismayilov, which stems from an incident in which Ismayilov allegedly behaved rudely towards a client at his law firm. On September 16, the Collegium's Presidium decided to return the complaint to the Collegium's Disciplinary Commission for further investigation. Ismayilov holds that the complaint is the result of political pressure. The complaint against Ismayilov appeared after he filed a lawsuit against several high-ranking government officials, including presidential administration chief Ramiz Mehtiyev and Chief Prosecutor Zakir Garalov, for the confiscation of factories belonging to the Zulfigar brothers, religious figures that are currently imprisoned on charges of planning a violent coup.   </p>

<p>In mid-September, lawyer Elchin Sadigov reported being contacted by Deputy Chair of the Collegium, Farhad Najafov, who informed him that an individual named Bayram Aliyev had filed a complaint with the Collegium against him. Although Sadigov does not know, and has never met, anyone by the name Bayram Aliyev, Sadigov was required to provide the Collegium with records documenting his work over the past year, and continues to be the subject of an ongoing investigation. Sadigov has characterized the investigation as part of a recent campaign of pressure against lawyers that take on issues and clients deemed to be subversive. In the past, Sadigov has litigated cases on behalf of <em>Azadliq Newspaper</em> Editor-in-Chief Ganimat Zahid, wrongfully imprisoned newspaper editor Eynulla Fatullayev, journalist Agil Khalilov, who was forced to leave Azerbaijan after witnessing and reporting on the illegal acts of a National Security Ministry official, and defendants in several other high-profile cases. </p>

<p>On August 24, 2011, Azerbaijan's Lawyers Collegium issued a decision prohibiting Khalid Bagirov from carrying out "lawyerly activities" for one year. The decision was based on a complaint filed by Baku City Police Chief Rafig Abbasov which accused Bagirov of violating Azerbaijan's law governing the conduct of lawyers. Prior to his year-long expulsion, Bagirov was involved in a number of contentious cases, including that of Elvin Askerov, who died while in police custody of severe head injuries reportedly inflicted by the police, and imprisoned human rights activist, Vivadi Iskanderov.  </p>

<p>In February 2011, the Collegium issued a decision to expel Osman Kazimov. The decision was based on a complaint filed by Rustam Usubov, first deputy to Azerbaijan's Chief Prosecutor. The case stems from an incident in which Kazimov refused to sign the protocol of a questioning session because the investigator misrepresented his client's statements. The Chief Prosecutor's Office interpreted the refusal as a failure to provide representation to the accused, a violation of Azerbaijan's law governing the conduct of lawyers and the nation's criminal procedure code, filed a complaint with the Collegium, which resulted in Kazimov's expulsion and a lawsuit. In July, the decision to expel Kazimov from the Collegium was abolished in a settlement agreement reached in Baku's Binegedi Court. Kazimov has represented Ganimat Zahid, who was a victim of wrongful imprisonment and the subject of countless lawsuits, numerous activists and officers from the Musavat opposition party and many other dissidents and victims of human rights violations.    </p>

<p>The repression of independent lawyers in Azerbaijan has caused an international outcry. The trend represents a serious barrier to justice, and a particularly significant one in the area of human rights. According to the DOS's 2010 Human Rights Report, there was, at the time of publication, only 768 collegium members, and only an estimated 415 members were actually practicing. Access to licensed legal representation was particularly restricted outside the capital, Baku. In 2010, the Council of Europe also produced a <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/evaluation/2010/Synthese_en.asp">report</a> on European judicial systems that indicated there were only nine lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants of Azerbaijan, giving Azerbaijan the lowest lawyer to inhabitant ratio in the entire Council of Europe (although Scotland's statistic appears lower, at four lawyers per 100,000 people, the country also utilizes legal advisors, unlike Azerbaijan. Scotland has 203.6 legal advisors and lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants). Beyond Azerbaijan's low lawyer to citizen ratio, many lawyers are reluctant to take on difficult or highly political cases due to fear of exactly the type of retribution Namazov, Kazimov, Ismayilov and Sadigov face.</p>

<p>The recent harassment of Azerbaijan's independent lawyers and the country's failure to maintain an independent body to regulate the legal profession contravenes obligations Azerbaijan has undertaken before the international community, including the UN and the Council of Europe. The UN's <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/lawyers.htm">Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers</a> holds that governments must ensure an environment in which lawyers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. Furthermore, lawyers are not to suffer or be threatened with prosecution for any actions taken in accordance with the profession's recognized duties, standards and ethics. On the same note, the Council of Europe issued a <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&InstranetImage=533749&SecMode=1&DocId=370286&Usage=2">recommendation</a> [PDF] pursuant to which the regulation of the legal profession should be entrusted to an independent body and, at the very least, its decisions should be subject to review by an independent, impartial judicial authority. While this is only a recommendation, it has been incorporated by resolution into the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=Res%282002%2912&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=CM&BackColorInternet=9999CC&BackColorIntranet=FFBB55&BackColorLogged=FFAC75">mandate</a> of the Council of Europe's European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, of which Azerbaijan is a member. Accordingly, Azerbaijan should strive to achieve the standards set forth in the recommendation. </p>

<p>In conclusion, Azerbaijan needs to take steps toward reforming its Lawyers' Collegium, so that the entity can issue independent, impartial decisions on disciplinary matters. One way to achieve this might be reforming the Presidium. According to Khalid Bagirov, Presdium members serve for five years. Nonetheless, its current members' terms expired in 2009 and they are yet to be replaced. In addition, the Collegium needs to work to include a greater number of lawyers within the organization. Law is a very popular major in Azerbaijani universities, however very few of these students actually manage to successfully join the Collegium. This could be ameliorated by holding entrance exams more frequently and by ensuring that the second-level of the exam, which involves an interview, is not used to weed out aspiring lawyers that seek to serve dissidents, journalists and human rights activists. The country's leadership and its activists could also consider creating a new lawyers collegium that would replace or coexist with the current Collegium. However, until such an organization's members would be authorized to conduct "lawyerly activity" within the framework of Azerbaijan's Law on Lawyers and Lawyerly Activities, it and its members would not be able to exercise any amount of significant power. Although talks were previously held on this matter in 2005 and 2006, little progress was made and the government was reluctant to authorize a new or concurrent collegium. Finally, Azerbaijan should bear in mind that creating obstacles that prevent people from lawfully pursuing the profession of their choice, such as through the arbitrary expulsion of lawyers from the Collegium, can in and of itself be viewed as a human rights violation. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Rifat Kassis, President of <a href="http://www.defenceforchildren.org/">Defence for Children International</a> (DCI), argues that Palestinian children detained by the Israeli military often face abuse, mistreatment and torture in violation of international law and human rights...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/hotline/rifatodehkassis.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), Israel's prolonged occupation has led to astonishing detention statistics. Since the beginning of the official military occupation in 1967, over 700,000 Palestinians have been detained: this figure amounts to around 20 percent of the existing Palestinian population in the OPT, which consists of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Among the most egregious aspects of Israeli detention policy is its <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-investigator-called-for-increased-protection-for-children-in-west-bank-gaza-strip.php">treatment of child prisoners</a>. Indeed, when one examines the wide range of violations committed against the rights of Palestinian children in conflict with the law, the psychological consequences of the occupation as suffered by children are rendered in stark relief.</p>

                <p>The legal apparatus of the Israeli military system does not endeavor to protect Palestinian children's rights; the military courts, under which children from the OPT are tried, lack comprehensive fair trial and juvenile justice standards. In September 2009, Israel established the Military Juvenile Court, but the situation on the ground remains essentially unchanged. On September 27, 2011, the Israeli military authorities raised the age of majority in the military courts to 18 years old. Until this time, the age had been officially set at 16, which directly defied the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/crc/index_30160.html">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. However, in practice, children as young as 12 have been and continue to be tried in military courts, with those 14 years of age often being tried as adults.</p>

                <p>As of the Second Intifada (which began in September 2000), Israel began to employ administrative detention against children. Since this time the arrest and detention of children has grown more rampant and systemic, with around 700 children detained each year, and frequently held with adults in detention. The most common charge is stone throwing. At the time of this writing, <a href="http://dci-palestine.org/documents/detention-bulletin-issue-21-september-2011">164 Palestinian children are in Israeli detention</a>, 35 of whom are between the ages of 12 and 15.</p>

                <p>In addition to regularly suffering abuse and torture similar to that of adult prisoners (beatings, blindfolding, being painfully shackled, position abuse, solitary confinement, electric shocks, threats of sexual assault, coercion into signing documents in Hebrew despite being unable to read them), children in detention are routinely subjected to tactics designed to exploit their age and intimidate them into confessions. These illegally obtained admissions are often used as evidence in the military courts. In the overwhelming majority of cases before these courts, children are denied bail and ordered to remain in detention until the end of the legal process. <a href="http://www.dci-pal.org/english/publ/display.cfm?DocId=1166&CategoryId=8">Credible allegations of ill-treatment</a> and torture are not investigated. </p>

                <p>In September, DCI-Palestine <a href="http://dci-palestine.org/documents/detention-bulletin-issue-21-september-2011">submitted a report</a> to the UN highlighting the particular situation of Palestinian children detained in East Jerusalem between January 1 and June 30, 2011. During this period, DCI-Palestine provided legal representation to 118 children and collected 16 sworn testimonies, which revealed that 80 percent of the children were detained on charges of throwing stones. 100 percent were not informed of their right to silence. 69 percent underwent interrogation without their parents present. 50 percent were subjected to physical violence. 44 percent were threatened. 44 percent were shown or told to sign documents in Hebrew. In addition, 31 percent were arrested in the middle of the night.</p>

                <p>The plight of Palestinian child prisoners, and of prisoners in general, is a crisis of particular urgency within the range of human rights violations characterizing life under occupation. It is also crucial to think of this crisis as one manifestation among many of Israeli occupation policy in general. The measures levied against Palestinian children in military courts are an egregious example of the ways in which legal policies implemented in the OPT seek to suppress Palestinian dissent, movement, autonomy and ability to exercise their human rights as sanctioned by international law.<br />

		<title>Sharia in Libya: Implications for Human Rights and the Rule of Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/ilsp/people/visiting_researchers.php">Umar Oseni</a> of Harvard Law School says the international concern over the announcement of Islamic law in Libya is misplaced, and instead the international community should focus on helping build an Islamic legal system that upholds human rights and the rule of law...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/umaroseni.png"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>fter the long awaited capture and controversial <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">killing of Muammar Gaddafi</a>, Chairman Mustafa Abdul-Jalil of the National Transitional Council (NTC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-declares-official-liberation-from-gaddafi-regime.php">declared national liberation</a> in Benghazi on Sunday October 23, 2011. An important part of this statement, which has continued to stir controversy among political analysts and human rights activists across the world, is the announcement that Sharia will prevail in the liberated Libya. In his words, "As an Islamic country, we adopted sharia as the principal law," and he concludes: "Any law that violates sharia is null and void legally." This proclamation of Sharia has continued to spur great controversy across the world particularly among the countries that spearheaded the ousting of the former leader, Muammar Gaddafi. There are mixed feelings on the success of the NATO mandate in Libya and the uncertain future Libya in the hands of the NTC, whose future is dicey according to some political commentators. </p>

<p>Though it may not be so important to quibble over semantics, it is appropriate to quickly mention in passing that there is nothing called "Sharia law" or "Islamic Sharia." This is a common malapropism among many scholars who study Islam and its laws. The correct usage of the term is "Sharia" or simply "Islamic Law." Returning to the matter at hand, we shall judge the seriousness of the NTC from two legal viewpoints. The first is its proclaimed Sharia and the second is the modern human rights standards and the far-reaching implications of certain infelicitous moves made by the NTC regarding the country's legal system.   </p>

<p><strong>Libya and the Paradox of Declaring Sharia</strong></p>

<p>Ensuring the rule of law in post-conflict states such as Libya requires close monitoring, capacity building and international assistance to establish just and equitable institutions that can stand the test of time. Though the declaration of Sharia at the onset may look pleasing to some within Libya, what is needed at this stage is to encourage post-conflict reconciliation through relevant commissions and the installation of a new government that will uphold the rule of law. Needless to say, the predominant religion in Libya is Islam, with about <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ly.html">97 percent of the populace being Muslim</a>. The lives of this huge population of Libyans are supposedly guided by the dictates of the Sharia from civil to commercial matters. No one can deny the people of Libya the right to adhere to the rules of the Sharia. The classical Sharia <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Criminal_Law_of_Islam.html?id=VEAhAAAACAAJ">stipulates certain groundwork reforms</a> and policies that must be put in place before the enforcement of the Islamic law rules particularly in the administration of criminal justice system. Such reforms constitute a <em>sine qua non</em> to the full implementation of the Sharia in any state. In any case, such legal and socioeconomic reforms are themselves considered as part of the Sharia. What emerges from the recurrent politicization of Sharia in some Muslim countries may not be different from what we are now experiencing in Libya. This line of thought is supported by the very fact that 42 years ago, after coming to power during the 1969 Libyan Revolution, Gaddafi announced his resolve to reinstate the Sharia and abrogate important laws that contradicted the precepts of Islamic law. Five years into his regime saw a remarkable <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=E-SlpBF145UC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0%23v=onepage&q&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false">about-face</a>. The law reforms that took place since then violated international human rights standards as well as the Sharia which he earlier proclaimed. Some analysts fear that history will repeat itself in the uncertain sociopolitical and legal future under the NTC and its successors.</p>

<p>All hands must be on deck to prevent future conflicts and this requires the development of a justice system that protects human rights and promotes the rule of law in line with international human rights standards. Previous research has <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/PublicInternationalLaw/InternationalHumanRights/?view=usa&ci=9780199266593">emphasized areas of convergence</a> between international human rights standards and cardinal Sharia principles. The new leadership in Libya should vigorously explore these areas. State building and post-conflict reconciliation is also provided for in the Sharia and there are numerous best practices that can be harmonized with the Sharia to build a new Libya.</p>

<p><strong>Sharia, Human Rights and Rule of Law in Libya</strong></p>

<p>Post-Gaddafi Libya poses a major challenge to the NTC. With the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8846720/Libya-will-be-a-moderate-Muslim-nation-countrys-interim-leader-insists.html">promise that Libya will be a moderate Muslim nation</a>, one begins to think of the implications of such declaration on human rights and rule of law in the sociopolitical landscape of the country. The rights of the minorities, women and Gaddafi loyalists must be protected by the new regime in line with real Sharia and international human rights standards. The circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's death require an in-depth inquiry, as many begin to ask whether this is the kind of Sharia the NTC intends to introduce in Libya. The country has despairingly tarried along the lines of complete neglect of civic, social, political and cultural rights under Gaddafi in recent decades.  </p>

<p>It is paradoxical to think of the circumstances under which Gaddafi was killed after he was captured alive and the subsequent disrespect of his remains. These are against the precepts of the ideal Sharia. Taking a quick look at the classical Sharia itself on rules of engagement, corpses must be respected and buried immediately and should not be desecrated no matter the religious beliefs, political leanings or racial background of such bodies. Sharia forbids the mutilation of the human body or the continuous display of such body in a denigrating manner where people view the corpse not as a mark of respect but in a humiliating manner. Frankly put, the NTC fighters have not only violated basic human rights provided for in the Sharia, but have also violated the law and custom of war under international law.</p>

<p>Besides, it is on record that the NTC fighters violated the fundamental rights of many sub-Saharan African migrants in Libya on the assumption that they were mercenaries employed by Gaddafi. There have also been reports of persecution of Gaddafi's tribesmen and those sharing his surname, which incidentally, is a common name in Libya. As Anissa Haddadi aptly <a href="http://m.ibtimes.com/gaddafi-s-death-and-the-liberated-libya-uncertainties-prevail-236378.html">suggests</a>, "resentment might take more than just a few months to die down." The concepts of justice and rule of law provide for certain universal standards, which must be respected by the new leadership in Libya. As the NTC is pursuing its Sharia agenda while forging ahead to build a democratic state based on the rule of law, reconciliation remains a key element in the post-conflict era. Sharia principles give preference to reconciliation above any other process as a mandatory requirement for state building.  According to Haddadi, "[t]he NTC's vision of an Islamic based and democratic society is not new in the Arab world but has proven difficult to establish." An Islamic based democratic government shoulders a lot of responsibilities since it is required to uphold justice and the rule of law in accordance with the religion on one hand, and strive to harmonize such a system with existing international best practices on the other.  </p>

<p><strong>Need for Reforms in the Administration of Justice</strong></p>

<p>There is no doubt in the fact that the justice system in Libya is in complete disarray and there is a need to establish a system that would vigorously pursue the course of justice while upholding the rule of law. Human rights violations were the bane of the previous regime. The NTC now has the sole responsibility to determine the future of the country and, to this end, ensure peace, justice and human rights with an emphasis on freedom of speech. According to a recent <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/libya-pursuing-al-gaddafi-%E2%80%93-legal-questions-answered-2011-08-25">report by Amnesty International</a>, key legal reforms needed in the new Libya include: (1) providing the definitions for certain crimes under international law such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, enforced disappearance and extrajudicial executions in the Libyan Criminal Code; (2) adequate legal safeguards, particularly in cases that are deemed to be political in nature; (3) an independent judiciary; and (4) ensuring that security forces follow Libyan law and international standards. Interestingly, the Chairman of the NTC is the former justice minister under the Gaddafi regime. Even though he resigned from the Gaddafi government during the brutal crackdown against peaceful demonstrators in Benghazi, he tacitly supported the excesses of the previous administration. It is hoped that the NTC under his leadership will be able to usher in a new regime that will respect human rights and the rule of law.</p>

<p><strong>Dropping the Manichean Plotline: The Future of Libya</strong></p>

<p>Finally, it is better to focus for the time being on how to assist the NTC in streamlining its new Sharia legal system in accordance with the ideal Islamic legal system, upholding human rights and promoting justice and equality just like any other liberal democracy. It is the responsibility of the international community to ensure that the Sharia in Libya is modeled after progressive Muslim countries such as Turkey and Malaysia who also have a great deal of Islamic law principles in their respective legal systems. The proclamation of Sharia may not have much implication on the people of Libya, but what is important at the moment is how the new government is able to reconcile all the parties and different factions in order to establish a new progressive Libya where peace and justice prevail. Regardless of what kind of legal system the new regime seeks to adopt, one is drawn to conclude that systemic reforms are urgently needed in all the state institutions, particularly to promote human rights and the rule of law. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Melissa Reed, Vice President for Public Policy at <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-systems/">Planned Parenthood Health Systems, Inc.</a>, says that the recently blocked provisions of a North Carolina abortion law violated First Amendment rights and were a demeaning invasion into the relationship between women and their doctors...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/melissareed.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>wo weeks ago, the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">granted a preliminary injunction</a> blocking enforcement of some of the most intrusive measures in the new North Carolina abortion law. These provisions would have required abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and then show and describe the images in detail at least four hours before performing an abortion, even if the woman objects. The court ruled that these requirements were likely to violate the providers' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> rights by compelling them to deliver government speech that is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest.  </p>

                <p>Planned Parenthood is extremely pleased with the ruling. The court stood on the side of women and health care providers. Planned Parenthood joined as a plaintiff in this suit in support of our doctors and staff, and more importantly, the women we care for every day. We trust women to make health care decisions without politicians intervening in those most personal matters. Sadly, the drafters of the "<a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">Woman's Right to Know Act</a>" disagree. They believe that women need politicians, not doctors, directing their medical care. They crafted a law that is an egregious intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship. In fact, this law puts politicians and their extremist ideology right into the exam room.  </p>

                <p>Planned Parenthood's top concern is providing patients the highest quality care. Physicians who provide abortion care at Planned Parenthood and other health centers across the state provide compassionate, individualized care that includes meaningful informed consent. This law prevents licensed health care providers from providing the highest quality and most compassionate health care based on the individual needs of patients, including those who are the victims of rape and incest, or those who receive a tragic diagnosis during pregnancy. Without the court's injunction, a woman facing the loss of a much-wanted pregnancy would have been forced to have ultrasound images placed in front of her and described to her. Her only recourse would have been to "avert[] her eyes" and to "refus[e] to hear," perhaps by covering her ears and humming a tune. Then, after this demeaning experience, she would still have been forced to wait another four hours prior to the procedure.  </p>

                <p>As the district court recognized, this law "goes well beyond requiring the disclosure of those items traditionally a part of the informed consent process ... In this case, the state compels the provider to physically speak and show the state's non-medical message to patients unwilling to hear or see."  </p>

                <p>This law is not about improving women's health care. The district court explained that "the undisputed evidence offered by the Plaintiffs establishes that these provisions are likely to harm the psychological health of the very group the state purports to protect." Women and their doctors are faced with difficult pregnancy decisions every day. Every woman should be able to trust that her doctor can provide her with the most appropriate care based on her individual needs. </p>

                <p>We will continue to fight this mean-spirited, dangerous and unconstitutional law and hope that the courts will agree and protect women from this demeaning intrusion on the personal, private relationship between women and their doctors. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.mc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/will/">Jonathan Will</a> of Mississippi College School of Law says establishing pre-embryonic personhood may still fail to outlaw abortion and may lead to the imposition of restrictions on other reproductive choices such as certain forms of birth control...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/jonathanwill.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>O</b></font>n November 8, 2011, citizens of Mississippi will pass judgment on an <a href="http://www.sos.ms.gov/page.aspx?s=7&s1=1&s2=50">amendment</a> to the state constitution that defines the term "person" or "persons," for purposes of the state's Bill of Rights, to include human beings from the moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof. Similar personhood initiatives failed comfortably in <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">Colorado</a> in 2008 and 2010.</p>

<p>Proponents of these initiatives are clear that they intend to challenge the legal underpinnings of the US Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence. Specifically, the personhood movement emphasizes the language in Justice Harry Blackmun's majority opinion in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673">Roe v. Wade</a>, in which he suggests that if the legal personhood of the fetus were established, the case in favor of the woman's right to choose to have an abortion would collapse because the fetus's right to life would then be guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The argument would be that depriving these newly-recognized persons of life without due process would be problematic.</p>

<p>Even if pre-embryonic personhood is established, I am not convinced that the personhood movement will succeed in outlawing abortion. Moreover, while failing to outlaw abortion, the movement may successfully lead to the imposition of restrictions on other reproductive choices, like access to infertility treatments or even certain types of birth control.  </p>

<p>Considering abortion, it is useful to imagine ways in which a federal constitutional challenge might arise. If a state constitutional amendment passes, like those put forth in Colorado and Mississippi, at least a couple of things could happen. The state courts could determine that this new understanding of personhood immediately applies throughout the state's existing legislative framework. Once the amendment became effective, a local prosecutor could then put clinics on notice that if they perform abortions criminal prosecutions will follow. This would permit the clinics to challenge the amendment, and certainly as soon as a woman seeks to have an abortion and cannot, a federal constitutional challenge would be ripe.  </p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the language of the amendment is deemed to require enabling legislation to put it in motion, first there would be lobbying efforts seeking to shape what such an anti-abortion statute would look like. South Dakota recently attempted to enact anti-abortion legislation, and if their experience is any example, it is far from certain that agreement within the legislature would be reached. Elected officials there struggled with whether the statute should include an exception for rape and, if so, how to define rape. Would only forceful or violent rape count? Would you include statutory rape where a 16-year-old girl has sex with an 18-year-old? What about the drunken encounter in the dorm room after a fraternity party? Then there are issues surrounding whether exceptions should exist where a woman's life or health is put at risk by continued pregnancy. Assuming the legislature agrees on the language of the anti-abortion statute, as soon as a woman seeks to have an abortion and is prevented, again a federal constitutional challenge would be ripe.  </p>

<p>Proponents of personhood initiatives are hopeful that when these challenges make their way through the federal courts, the establishment of pre-embryonic personhood will inevitably lead to <em>Roe</em> being overturned. After all, how could a woman's right to choose ever trump a fetus's right to life? This outcome is far from inevitable, however. Even if all 50 states amended their constitutions to say that "life" or "personhood" begins at fertilization, that would not automatically define (or re-define) "person" in the US Constitution.  </p>

<p>That said, state constitutional recognition of pre-embryonic personhood may change the nature of the inquiry. In the existing abortion jurisprudence, the US Supreme Court struggles with defining the nature of the state interest involved, referring to it as a "legitimate interest" in protecting "prenatal life," "potential life," the life of the "unborn child," and so forth &#8212; something other than protecting the life after birth. As recently as 2007, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7079370668659431881">Gonzales v. Carhart</a>, the Court stated that "by common understanding and scientific understanding, a fetus is a living organism while within the womb." If a state constitution specifically recognized the personhood of these living organisms, as pre-embryonic personhood would, then the state's asserted interest may be considered more firmly established.  </p>

<p>Even if the US Supreme Court acknowledged the state's asserted interest in protecting pre-embryonic life as constitutionally "compelling" (as opposed to merely legitimate as noted <em>Gonzales</em>), the state's ability to impose affirmative duties on private parties to protect that life seems far from certain. As a general matter, even physicians only have a duty to treat (thereby protecting the life of patients) if they voluntarily assume such duty. While the Supreme Court may have been able to avoid this type of inquiry under prior cases, it may be unable to do so in the context of recognized pre-embryonic personhood.</p>

<p>It is possible that the Court will nonetheless continue to recognize a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy as protected under the federal constitution. In doing so, the Court might strike down personhood amendments as applied to abortion, but it may permit states to acknowledge pre-embryonic personhood in other contexts. Fetal homicide statutes have frequently been upheld. What might this mean for other reproductive choices where the competing interest is not as firmly protected by the federal constitution?</p>

<p>Take the fundamental right to procreate as an example. Does this include a right to have access to infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF)? After pre-embryonic personhood is established, a state will have an interest in regulating IVF to ensure that these newly-recognized persons are adequately protected. In Georgia for example, a statute was proposed that severely restricted the practice of IVF by limiting the number of eggs that could be fertilized and subsequently implanted. Embryologists lobbied against the statute arguing that it would effectively prevent them from practicing.</p>

<p>What about birth control? Proponents of personhood initiatives suggest that any discussion of potential limitations on access to birth control amounts to fear mongering. But this argument proves too much. If personhood is established at fertilization, then any birth control method that is potentially effective after fertilization (for instance, by preventing implantation) would necessarily be problematic. This would include many common types of hormonal contraception where the mechanism of operations may not be known. Further, while the Supreme Court's jurisprudence on birth control might be clear that a state cannot deny access to all types of birth control, its ability to restrict access to certain types of birth control seems to me to be an open question.  </p>

<p>Even if personhood amendments are unsuccessful in their attempt to overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, they may be successful, whether that was the intent or not, in imposing severe restrictions on other reproductive choices. One can only hope that these issues are being considered by those voting on such constitutional amendments.</p>

		<title>NTC Must Investigate Gaddafi&#039;s Death to Establish Credibility</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.issafrica.org/programme_item.php?PID=7">Ottilia Maunganidze</a>, Researcher at the <a href="http://www.iss.co.za/default.php">Institute for Security Studies</a>, says that the NTC must conduct a proper investigation into Muammar Gaddafi's death to meet its international obligations and ensure justice for human rights violations...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/ottiliaannamaunganidze.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n October 25, 2011, the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-leader-orders-investigation-into-gaddafi-death.php">open a formal investigation</a> into the death of former Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. On October 20, Gaddafi's convoy was hit by a NATO airstrike in Sirte. Gaddafi sustained serious injuries and video footage shows him alive immediately after the strike. Accounts of what happened following Gaddafi's seizure by NTC fighters are varied. An autopsy conducted by Libya's chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Othman al-Zintani, confirmed that Gaddafi died from a gunshot wound to the head. What remains unanswered is by whom and in what manner. Al-Zintani has not disclosed additional details of the autopsy and is set to deliver a full pathology report to the attorney general. The pathologist's report should be one of the key sources that the NTC investigation consults. </p>

                <p>According to Libya's interim leader, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the decision to establish the commission of inquiry was prompted by <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-office-calls-for-investigation-into-gaddafi-killing.php">calls to probe the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's death</a> from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR has welcomed the NTC's announcement and stated that the process should be in accordance with international law. The laws of war under international law govern the investigation into the manner of Gaddafi's death. <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/375-590006?OpenDocument">Article 3(1)(a)</a> of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, read together with <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/475?OpenDocument">Additional Protocol II of 1977</a>, states that all parties to an armed conflict are prohibited from killing wounded persons or people no longer actively participating in hostilities. Furthermore, Article 3(2) provides that all wounded parties must be cared for. </p>

                <p>While opposing theories abound as to when and how Gaddafi met his end, the crux is establishing whether Gaddafi was killed intentionally or whether, as the NTC suggests, he was killed by crossfire. If Gaddafi was shot willfully, then the persons responsible for his murder violated the provisions of Article 3 and committed a war crime, and would be liable for prosecution. If, however, Gaddafi died a collateral death as a result of crossfire, then the matter might be put to rest. Clearly, a commission of inquiry is necessary to establish the exact facts. </p>

                <p>The test for the NTC will be in ensuring that the commission of inquiry abides by the law. According to Christof Heyns, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a proper investigation into Gaddafi's death will be a test for the transitional government as a democratic and accountable institution. It is imperative therefore that the commission of inquiry consists of qualified individuals who will investigate the facts of Gaddafi's death. Thereafter, the commission of inquiry must submit a report stating the facts and proposing a way forward. However, whether a fair and transparent inquiry will be conducted remains to be seen.<br />
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the NTC may have summarily executed 53 Gaddafi loyalists in Sirte. Though welcoming the decision to launch a formal investigation into Gaddafi's death, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hrw-urges-libya-to-investigate-bodies-found-in-sirte.php">has also called on the NTC to investigate</a> these allegations. Such a call ought to gain traction, as there are disturbing correlations between the claims of Gaddafi's execution and the deaths of his loyalists.</p>

                <p>In addition to establishing a commission of inquiry into the deaths of Gaddafi and his loyalists, the NTC still has a responsibility to arrest and surrender Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, and his former intelligence chief, Abdullah al-Senussi, to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Both al-Islam and al-Senussi remain subject to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">ICC arrest warrants</a> for crimes against humanity committed during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a>, following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">referral of the situation to the ICC</a> by the UN Security Council. In terms of the UN Security Council referral, the primary responsibility is on the Libyan government to cooperate fully with and provide any necessary assistance to the ICC. </p>

                <p>Now that the NTC is in power, it must prove itself to Libyans and the international community. Establishing a commission of inquiry into Gaddafi's death is one way in which the NTC can do this. It also should investigate the alleged executions of Gaddafi loyalists. Lastly, the NTC must adhere to its international obligations and ensure that justice is served for crimes committed during the Libyan crisis since February 2011.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ua.edu/directory/People/view/Daniel_Joyner">Daniel Joyner</a> of the University of Alabama School of Law says the IAEA went outside of its legal mandate with its latest report on Iran, a move that has been viewed by some states as indicating the IAEA's shift from a technical body to a politicized one...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/DanJoyner.png"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n November 8, Yukiya Amano, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), delivered a formal <a href="http://www.isisnucleariran.org/assets/pdf/IAEA_Iran_8Nov2011.pdf">report</a> [PDF] on Iran's nuclear program to the IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council. </p>

<p>This report is most notable for its analysis and findings regarding possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. In previous reports, the Director General had expressed concern about this as well. However, in this report, the Director General's office provided its most thorough and comprehensive analysis of all information and evidence that it has acquired on Iran's nuclear program, either directly through the work of IAEA inspectors, or by the provision of information to the IAEA by national governments.  </p>

<p>The report details information on Iran's nuclear program and presents information which, the report asserts, "indicates that Iran has carried out ... activities that are relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device." Most of the evidence for this assertion presented in this report has been known in official and non-official circles for some time. However, the report is notable for its public presentation of the information on Iranian weapons-related activities held by the IAEA, and its detailed analysis of that information. This analysis includes a discussion of Iran's capabilities and activities with regard to the production and enrichment of fissile material, in particular uranium, which has been the subject of a number of IAEA Board of Governors reports and UN Security Council decisions. </p>

<p>However, the analysis does not stop with this consideration of the location of Iran's uranium stores and the status of its facilities that are directly linked to the production and enrichment of uranium, all of which must be under IAEA safeguards pursuant to Iran's agreement with the IAEA. Rather, the analysis in this report is mostly dedicated to discussing other activities which the IAEA, again, considers "relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device." These activities can generally be described as activities of design, research and experimentation related to the development of a nuclear warhead &#8212; i.e. the actual explosive device that weaponizes fissile material into a nuclear weapon.  </p>

<p>These activities include Iran's possession of a document which "describes, inter alia, processes for the conversion of uranium compounds into uranium metal and the production of hemispherical enriched uranium metallic components"; the development of "safe, fast-acting detonators, and equipment suitable for firing the detonators"; the possession of "information on the design concept of a multipoint initiation system that can be used to initiate effectively and simultaneously a high explosive charge over its surface"; "experimental research involving a scaled down version of [a] hemispherical initiation system and high explosive charge"; the construction of "a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments"; and the conduct of "studies involv[ing] the modeling of spherical geometries, consisting of components of the core of an HEU nuclear device subjected to shock compression, for their neutronic behaviour at high density, and a determination of the subsequent nuclear explosive yield."</p>

<p>This report is legally problematic in a number of ways.</p>

<p>Firstly and most fundamentally, the IAEA simply has no legal mandate to produce such a report on activities being carried on within an IAEA member state concerning items and technologies that may be related to the development of a nuclear explosive device, but that are not directly related to fissionable materials or associated facilities. </p>

<p>A thorough discussion of the IAEA's history, role and legal mandate cannot be presented here, though I have attempted such an analysis in my 2009 book, <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199204908.001.0001/acprof-9780199204908">International Law and the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction</a>. It must therefore suffice to say that the agency is tasked in the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/About/statute_text.html">IAEA Statute</a> to conclude safeguards agreements with IAEA member states, pursuant to which all fissionable materials and related facilities within the state are subject to IAEA safeguards, and to monitor and verify member states' compliance with these agreements. The IAEA is not tasked, either by its Statute or by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/conf/npt/2010/npttext.shtml">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> (NPT), in monitoring or verifying the compliance of states with their broader NPT legal obligations.</p>

<p>The basic undertaking of all IAEA safeguards agreements, including the IAEA's <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc214.pdf">agreement with Iran</a> [PDF], is spelled out in the first two articles of the document. Iran's safeguards agreement, which is the legal basis for the IAEA's monitoring and verification mandate with regard to Iran's nuclear program, states in Articles I and II:<blockquote>The Government of Iran undertakes, pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article III of the [NPT], to accept safeguards, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within its territory, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere, for the exclusive purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. ... The [IAEA] shall have the right and the obligation to ensure that safeguards will be applied, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of Iran, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere, for the exclusive purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</blockquote>Note that the role of the IAEA, as agreed with the Iranian government, is limited to applying and monitoring safeguards on fissionable material and related facilities within the territory of Iran, with the purpose of assuring that no such fissile material is diverted from peaceful nuclear activities to military purposes. The IAEA is given no authority to inquire into or to examine activities within Iran that are not directly related to fissile materials, even if they may possibly relate to the development of a nuclear explosive device. Again, the IAEA has a limited legal mandate that does not include being a general nuclear weapons watchdog. </p>

<p>Thus, in conducting these investigations into technologies other than fissile materials and producing this report, the IAEA is acting wholly outside of its authority pursuant to its safeguards agreement with Iran.</p>

<p>This is why the report's findings are so indeterminate. Since the IAEA is acting outside of its legal authority in this section of the report, it does not have a legal standard to apply to its conclusions regarding possible nuclear weapons related activities not involving fissile material. Throughout the report, the Director General expresses "concern" about the information being presented, and requests "clarification" from Iran in order to address these concerns. However, since there is no treaty language in Iran's, or any other state's, safeguards agreement that deals with non-fissile-material activities related to nuclear weapons, there is no prohibitive or regulatory standard that the Director General can point to against which to make a conclusion of compliance or non-compliance. In short, as the ancient legal maxim states, there can be no illegality where there is no law. The IAEA is simply "concerned."</p>

<p>Why they are concerned is itself a matter of curiosity. There is no knowledge or technical ability related to nuclear weapons detailed in this report, and allegedly possessed by Iran, which other technologically advanced non-nuclear-weapon states like Japan or Germany do not possess. These are specialized bodies of knowledge and technical capabilities, to be sure, but they are well within the knowledge base and technical abilities of these advanced industrial states. </p>

<p>Within nonproliferation studies circles, no one seriously doubts that Japan, for example, has all of the knowledge and technical ability relating to all necessary components and technologies that it would need to build a nuclear weapon in a matter of weeks or months if it made the political decision to do so. Japan has gained this knowledge through decades of high technology design, research and manufacturing experience, built upon a broad base of scientific knowledge gained through both in-country research and experimentation, and information sharing with other states.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Japan and Germany, and all other technologically and scientifically advanced non-nuclear-weapon states, knowledge about how to build a nuclear weapon &#8212; gained through scientific experiments, development of technological capability, or any other means including information sharing with other states &#8212; is not prohibited under international law, either in IAEA safeguards agreements or in the NPT itself.</p>

<p>What the NPT does provide in Article II is that all non-nuclear-weapon states shall not "manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." The term "manufacture" as used in Article II has been the subject of some controversy regarding its interpretation. Some current and former government officials and other observers, particularly in the US, hold that the prohibition on manufacturing a nuclear explosive device entails a scope which reaches far back along the knowledge acquisition and development line of a nuclear weapons program to the concept, capacity building, design, research and experimentation stages. Under this interpretation, the information presented in this new IAEA report might be considered evidence of a breach. However, this interpretation is incorrect by reference to the plain meaning of the terms of Article II, as confirmed by the negotiating history of the NPT.</p>

<p>Pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/vclt/vclt.html">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>, a treaty interpreter must first look to the plain meaning of the terms of a treaty provision taken in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose. For the plain meaning of the term "manufacture," one need only consult a dictionary. If you do, you will find a definition along the lines of "the making of goods from raw materials by manual labor or machinery." This definition will be accompanied by a listing of synonyms, such as "assemble" and "fabricate." The plain meaning of the term "manufacture" in Article II thus refers to the physical construction of a nuclear explosive device, or perhaps at its broadest reading, to the physical construction of the component parts of a nuclear explosive device.</p>

<p>In order to confirm the interpretation of a term rendered by an analysis of its plain meaning, an interpreter may consult the negotiating history of the treaty. In his seminal treatise on the negotiating history of the NPT, Mohamed Shaker offers this interesting vignette about the drafting of Article II, and in particular the term "manufacture":<blockquote>The prohibition on manufacture was envisaged in all the previous treaty drafts. The Soviet draft of 24 September 1965 also envisaged the undertaking by the States "not possessing nuclear weapons" not to "prepare for the manufacture" of nuclear weapons. The American draft as amended on 21 March 1966 included the preparations for the manufacture but only with respect to the prohibition on assistance. This means that non-nuclear-weapon States would have been allowed, under the American draft, to prepare for the manufacture of nuclear weapons<br />
as long as no assistance was provided from outside.</blockquote>There are at least two interesting points here that can help to confirm the meaning of "manufacture" given above. One is that in the early US and Soviet drafts of the NPT, there was a distinction clearly drawn between the terms "manufacture" and "prepare for the manufacture." These were separate terms of different scope and meaning, and were selected intentionally by different drafters for inclusion in different drafts. "Manufacture" was clearly of a more limited scope than "prepare for the manufacture," and looked more to the later steps of actual fabrication, construction and assembly of the component parts of a nuclear weapon, and to the completion of the full device from those component parts. "Prepare for the manufacture" clearly sought to include earlier steps on the ladder of development of a nuclear weapon, including the concept, capacity building, design, research and experimentation steps. The fact that both terms had been considered by the drafters, and that the term "manufacture" was the term eventually agreed upon by all NPT treaty parties, confirms the limited meaning of the term.</p>

<p>The second interesting point arising from the above negotiating history vignette is that it was the American draft of 1966 that apparently initiated the use of "manufacture," as opposed to "prepare to manufacture," in the text of what eventually became Article II. This fact is rather ironic in light of the current US-led efforts to expand the meaning of "manufacture" to include steps that would have much more persuasively been included in the term "prepare to manufacture," which was proposed by the Soviet Union for inclusion in the NPT and rejected by US drafters. </p>

<p>In the practice of states since the establishment of the NPT, the cases of Japan and Germany and other advanced industrialized countries who have the knowledge and capability to construct a nuclear weapon, but that have not on that account been criticized by the IAEA or by the UN Security Council, are yet further evidence of the correctness of this interpretation of the limited definition of the term "manufacture" in the Article II prohibition. </p>

<p>Some would argue that this definition of "manufacture" is too limited. They might argue that a purposive or intent-focused interpretation is most in keeping with the object and purpose of the NPT. They would inevitably reference the testimony which William Foster, the head of the US delegation to the NPT negotiations, gave before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1968.<blockquote>Facts indicating that the purpose of a particular activity was the acquisition of a nuclear explosive device would tend to show non-compliance. (Thus, the construction of an experimental prototype nuclear explosive device would be covered by the term "manufacture" as would be the production of components which would only have relevance to a nuclear explosive device.)</blockquote>The problem with such an interpretation is that it requires an inference of a specific intent or purpose associated with activities that could be related to a nuclear weapons program. That intent must be to manufacture or otherwise acquire a nuclear explosive device. While domestic legal systems routinely provide for the inference of intent as one criterion for the establishment of tortious or criminal liability, they seldom if ever provide for a determination of intent prospectively, i.e. in domestic law we seldom if ever allow a finder of fact to infer from evidence what the accused party intends to do in the future. Rather, we wait until the <em>actus reus</em>, or objective act-based element of a crime is committed before putting <em>actus reus</em> and <em>mens rea</em> together to determine liability. This is both an evidentiary point as well as a substantive element point. Substantively, it would be nearly impossible to ever show from evidence that falls short of satisfying the legal concept of "manufacture" as interpreted above, that an accused state nevertheless intends in the future to manufacture a nuclear explosive device. It will in almost all conceivable cases be just as reasonable, if not more so, to infer an intent simply to develop the knowledge and capacity necessary to manufacture a nuclear weapon, without actually constructing working components or a finished device. This is a strategy that Ariel Levite has referred to as "nuclear hedging." </p>

<p>Thus, my interpretation above of the Article II term "manufacture," which focuses on <em>actus reus</em> and does not focus on intent, is more persuasive from both an evidentiary and substantive perspective.</p>

<p>Since there is no evidence presented in this new report by the IAEA Director General that Iran has physically constructed a nuclear explosive device or any of its components, one can conclude that the Director General's concern expressed in this report cannot be justified as being based upon a breach of a rule of international law prohibiting the activities outlined in the IAEA report. Such a rule exists neither in Iran's safeguards agreement with the IAEA, or in the NPT. Rather, the reason for the IAEA's and the UN Security Council's attention to Iran can only be based on other factors, primarily including the determination of the US and other states that Iran is a threat to Israel, the region and international peace and security generally. </p>

<p>The UN Security Council does in fact have the authority to make such a determination, pursuant to Article 39 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a>, even though this grant of authority does not mean that such a decision is any less subjective and politicized as among UN Security Council member states. The IAEA, on the other hand, is not supposed to be a politicized body. It was established to be a purely technical body, tasked with independently verifying state compliance with agreements related to fissile materials accounting. Nevertheless, its track record in devoting so much critical attention to Iran over the past nine years, and not to other non-nuclear-weapon states who have for decades engaged in precisely the same production of knowledge and capabilities, through the same processes, has convinced both Iran and the other members of the Non-Aligned Movement (comprising the vast majority of states in the world) that the IAEA has thereby undermined its independence and objectivity as a technical monitoring and verification body. Instead, they believe, it has become a politicized instrument of the foreign policy goals of the US and other Western states. The agency's overreaching in its new report is simply the most recent evidence of this fact.</p>

Jones</em> as an opportunity to reaffirm Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, particularly in light of technological advances...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/jimharper.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>A</strong></font>s technology advances &#8212; and law enforcement adapts these advancements to police work &#8212; courts will be asked to apply the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in new and varied situations. The Supreme Court should ensure that courts maintain oversight of Information Age policing.<br />
                <br />
                In 2004, the FBI suspected Antoine Jones of dealing drugs. To verify their suspicions, agents secured a warrant allowing them to attach a GPS tracking device to Jones's car, but they attached the device after the warrant had expired, and in Maryland rather than Washington, DC, where the warrant was valid. The device monitored and recorded the car's every movement for nearly a month before law enforcement finally arrested Jones.<br />
                <br />
                Can law enforcement track people's every move using high-tech devices like this without a warrant? The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">found that the FBI's action was unconstitutional</a> because it violated Jones's "reasonable expectation of privacy" &#8212; the two-part Fourth Amendment standard developed in the landmark 1967 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594">Katz v. US</a>. The "reasonable expectation of privacy" doctrine holds that if a person has an actual, subjective expectation of privacy and that expectation is one society is prepared to accept, then the Fourth Amendment protects the object of that expectation. The court found that the long-term round-the-clock GPS surveillance, even of a vehicle always on public roads and in locations readily observable by a cop on the street, was qualitatively different than a temporary stakeout or other conventional surveillance. The government asked the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-gps-tracking-prosecutorial-misconduct.php">review the case</a>, and the Court has agreed, adding the issue of whether installing the GPS device was itself a Fourth Amendment violation, quite apart from the monitoring.<br />
                <br />
                The Court should take this opportunity to strengthen Fourth Amendment protections by finding unconstitutional the government's continuous and long-term tracking of someone's vehicle without a valid warrant, but not because it violates our "reasonable expectations of privacy." That language &#8212; which has dominated this area of law for over 40 years &#8212; is from the solo concurrence of Justice John Marshall Harlan, and it is a misinterpretation of <em>Katz</em> that has proven unworkable. The "reasonable expectation" test reverses the original focus of the Fourth Amendment, which asks whether government action, not private ordering, is reasonable.<br />
                <br />
                The majority holding in <em>Katz</em> found constitutional protection for information because the defendant had shielded others from learning the information the government wanted to acquire and use. This is the standard that the Court should apply. If information is private &#8212; if the general public does not have access to it &#8212; law enforcement stands in the same shoes as everyone else. Using over-the-top technologies to deprive people of the privacy they have created in their lives is a search, and that kind of searching is unreasonable unless a judge has approved of it.<br />
                <br />
                In this case, the government did not just collect information that was out there; it created data where none existed before, taking measurements at multi-second intervals of the whereabouts of their suspect for weeks. Nobody in the general public tracks anybody down to that much detail &#8212; except for stalkers. When service providers like cell phone companies do, it comes with contractual promises and regulations that keep information private.<br />
                <br />
                The Court can simplify this area of law a great deal. Fourth Amendment protection should not be measured by "expectations," but by straightforward factual questions. Was the information available to the general public? Did the defendant take appropriate steps to shield information from the public and thus government agents, including relying on the physics, law and economics that keep information obscure?<br />
                <br />
                A fascinating element of the case is the question of whether the government could convert Jones's vehicle into a surveillance system by attaching a GPS device to it. Doing so deprived Jones of an essential property right &#8212; the right to exclude others. Imagine if the Court does not recognize this as a seizure of property. Law enforcement might drop radio frequency identification tags in every coat pocket at a restaurant and learn through scanning these microchips on successive occasions who was at the restaurant and how often they return.<br />
                <br />
                Even if the Court continues to adhere to the "reasonable expectations of privacy" test, it should recognize the sanctity of Jones's property and find that surreptitious, highly intrusive surveillance using unfamiliar technologies like GPS is unconstitutional without a warrant.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the local Human Rights Ombudsman filed an action of unconstitutionality, the 11 justices of the Supreme Court of Mexico gathered last month to discuss and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045806/http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/09/mexico-high-court-allows-state-anti-abortion-amendment.php">rule on the constitutionality</a><span> of an amendment to the </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045806/http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/dee/leyes/ConstitucionPoliticadeBajaCalifornia.pdf">Constitution of Baja California</a><span> [Spanish, PDF] effectively banning abortions. The state of Baja California is one of 32 federal entities of Mexico.</span>

Although politicians and news reporters have been driving the public's attention to "pro-life vs. pro-choice" discussions, the Supreme Court's ruling has a much wider impact on Mexico's legal framework and case law than that revealed by the media. In fact, this is unlike the<span> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045806/http://jurist.org/paperchase/2008/08/mexico-supreme-court-upholds-first.php">case brought</a><span> </span>to the Supreme Court's attention in 2008, when Mexico City's local legislature decided to partially decriminalize abortion. This time, the legal text subject to challenge is a state's constitution, rather than a hierarchically inferior local criminal law.

The Human Rights Prosecutor of Baja California argued, before the highest judicial authority in Mexico, that a provision of Article 7 of the state's constitution was inconsistent with the Mexican Magna Carta. The provision states that the right to life of an individual starts at conception, and from that moment the<span> </span><em>nasciturus</em><span> </span>(unborn child) shall be under legal protection and shall be considered "born" for all legal purposes, until its natural or non-induced death. By Mexican law, the action of unconstitutionality is one of the primary tools in the system of checks and balances that the judicial branch has over the legislative branch. The Supreme Court is the only court in Mexico with jurisdiction over such actions. In order to declare a law invalid and unconstitutional a supermajority of eight votes is required.

After three sessions, the Supreme Court left the Constitution of Baja California intact. The majority failed to overturn the provision by a single vote. While seven justices considered the disputed provision discordant with the federal<span> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045806/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/1.pdf">Mexican Constitution</a><span> </span>[Spanish, PDF], the other four voted to uphold the provision. There were numerous arguments on each side. Although public and political debates outside of court influenced many of these arguments, only a few of them actually focused on providing a legal solution to the controversy.

This case was not about whether abortion should have been decriminalized, or whether or not the right to life should have prevailed over women's reproductive rights. These matters may somehow relate to the result issued by the Supreme Court, and may later be found to be the main subject of a controversy brought to such authority. However, they should have not been the foundation of justices' main inquiry. Some have suggested that the justices should have analyzed additional aspects of the case. In spite of this, the main legal discussion revolved around two primary topics, both being substantial and having no evident solution. This naturally caused the justices to struggle.

The first dispute between the justices was based on whether the federal constitution and the international treaties executed and ratified by Mexico infer that the right to life must be recognized from the moment of conception. The Supreme Court had to resolve this issue first since an affirmative answer would have immediately led to the amendment's constitutionality. Since Mexico is a party to the American Convention on Human Rights, some of the justices invoked<span> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045806/http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr4.html">Article 4</a><span> </span>of the convention. In part, Article 4 states: "Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception."

Notwithstanding this, the case remained unsolved for most justices. Mexico made an interpretative declaration to Article 4 of the convention, establishing that Mexico does not undertake any obligation to protect life "from the moment of conception." Additionally, the federal constitution does not have any clear language regarding the protection of the right to life starting from the moment the<span> </span><em>nasciturus</em><span> </span>is conceived.

Thus, the justices continued to the second dispute: are the local legislatures able to regulate or interpret human rights recognized under supreme national law? This was perhaps the most important and polarizing discussion faced by the Supreme Court. Nearly all of the justices that voted in favor of the legality of the amendment stated that since the Magna Carta has no evident reference to the moment in which the protection of the right to life shall begin, the individual states have the right to define such moment. In addition, these justices called upon a previous judicial criterion that the states are able to expand the catalog of human rights recognized by the federal government — "All powers not explicitly vested by this Constitution on federal authorities, are reserved to the states." This language belongs to Article 124 of the federal constitution and played an important role in supporting this position.

The other seven justices explained that while the states may be legally empowered to expand the catalog of human rights that are to be protected by the government of that state, they cannot do it if the expansion affects other human rights recognized in the federal constitution or international treaties. They made special reference to women's reproductive rights. Likewise, these justices said that the amendment not only had an impact in the local sphere but also impacted legal principles contained in the federal constitution. For example, it could affect the moment in which one is recognized as a person for legal purposes or when one is eligible for Mexican nationality.

In addition to these issues, both sides displayed some other interesting and respectable arguments that are too numerous and detailed to mention. However, it should not be long until the Supreme Court is forced to discuss a similar issue again, and these two topics should be part of that discussion.

Furthermore, this provision could be analyzed as a part of the growth of Mexican democracy. The number of differences among states' laws is starting to increase based on the predominant political ideologies of that state, unlike 30 years ago when the differences were minimal due to the influence of the president over most states' policies. Democratic growth is an undoubtedly positive sign for Mexico. However, it is very important that Mexico looks at the big picture. Not to de-emphasize this otherwise important matter, but the rulings in these cases not only decide the states' ability to determine the moment in which protection of the right to life should begin. Rather, these may also determine whether state legislatures are entitled to interpret human rights as well as the appropriate level of protection accorded to such rights, specifically when they are already part of the federal constitution.

		<title>Violations of Palestinian Children&#039;s Rights Raises Serious Risks</title>

However, insofar as "conflict" is understood as implying enmity between two more or less equal parties, it  is a misleading label and unhelpful to our understanding of the threats faced by Palestinian children within their daily lives. The control exercised over Palestinian society by Israel and the ability of its forces to enter even the most intimate spaces of domestic life at will and with impunity give rise to an array of dangers and obstacles in the lives of children. The report by <a href="http://occupiedpalestine.wordpress.com/2011/10/23/un-report-on-human-rights-situation-in-occupied-palestine-un-doc-a66358/">Richard Falk</a> and the article by JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://jurist.org/hotline/2011/11/rifat-kassis-palestinian-children.php">Rifat Kassis</a> highlight a particular aspect of the violations experienced by Palestinian children as a result of Israeli control over their lives: namely their treatment within the military justice system. Such maltreatment is only one element of a set of practices that have long been routine and which constitute serious dereliction of Israel's obligations under <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/380">international law</a> to protect <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">children</a> living in territory that it has occupied through military conquest. </p>

                <p>UN and international humanitarian organizations seeking to ensure the realization of children's rights in the oPt face innumerable challenges. The so-called <a href="http://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/international-law.php">"Four Ps" of child rights</a> &#8212; protection, provision, prevention and participation &#8212; are all threatened in systematic manner by policies that deny freedom of movement, inhibit economic life and appropriate land and natural resources for the exclusive use of settler colonies. Yet, humanitarians must not only negotiate a range of practical challenges in order to assist Palestinian children. In this highly politicized setting they need also to balance their institutional mandates with the agendas of governments that fund their operations. Political elites in the US, Canada and the EU member states have commonly minimized expressions of disquiet with Israeli treatment of the Palestinians, variously prioritizing economic and political interests over adherence to human rights standards and the rule of law. </p>

                <p>Constrained in their ability to directly address the causes of harm to Palestinian children resulting from occupation, humanitarian organizations focus largely on efforts to reduce suffering and strengthen the ability of children and their caregivers to cope. With these aims in view, extensive "psychosocial" programs commonly constitute much of the protection portfolio of UN and international agencies. In addition, numerous humanitarians are engaged in compiling evidence of Israeli violations, sending reports up through their organizational hierarchies to head offices in Brussels, London, New York and Washington, DC. The consequences of such extensive reporting are hard to discern; certainly Palestinian children remain vulnerable to serious harm in various ways due to the occupation and ongoing efforts aimed at colonization.  </p>

                <p>Many young Palestinians have expressed frustration at the perceived failure of the "international community" to act on the extensive knowledge available of Israeli violations. At a 2010 conference in Bethlehem on children's protection and participation organized by Defense for Children International, a teenager in the audience articulated his frustration in the following words: "In the past Israel was able to hide its crimes against children. ... Nowadays it's sure that the international community knows what is happening inside Israeli prisons to the children ... but I've never seen any real efforts to stop these crimes." (author's translation)</p>

                <p>Richard Falk's recent report is a further source of such knowledge for UN member states and operational agencies. It remains to be seen whether the information he has provided will lead to any increase in efforts to call Israel to account over its breaches of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Past experience does not give much cause for hope. Furthermore, bodies intended to monitor the adherence of states parties to the legal instruments that they have ratified, such as the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, have proven unequal to the task of ensuring that Israel cease its routine violations. </p>

                <p>Continued inaction, however, is not without its risks for both humanitarians and governments. As the details of Israel's violations are articulated in one report after another, the standing of child protection organizations that fail to act in accord with their own stated principles becomes vulnerable to scrutiny. In such circumstances, silence justified in the name of neutrality looks ever more like complicity. Moreover, concerns that humanitarians are functioning as a fig leaf for the failure and shortcomings of foreign policy amongst Western governments are liable to gain further traction. Those same governments' failure to act in response to information about violations publicly conveyed also carries self-defeating risks. The agenda of human rights, rule of law and good governance pursued by many European and North American states in various countries in the Middle East, particularly in the wake of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a>, is widely heralded. As yet one more damning report reveals Israeli disregard for such matters, the distrust and resentment of young Palestinians and their peers around the Arab world towards governments that continue to offer vast, unconditional support to Israel can only increase.</p>

Dukes</a> is widely regarded as one of the most important in the Supreme Court's last term. In that case, the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit certifying what would have been the largest class action suit in history, alleging that Wal-Mart paid women less than men and promoted them less often.</p>

<p>In <em>Dukes</em>, the Court fails to grapple with an important dilemma at the heart of discrimination law: how to frame discrimination claims. Increasingly, the legal lens through which courts view a certain set of facts determines whether those facts establish discrimination. Despite the number of avowed textualists on the Supreme Court, the lens through which that Court views discrimination is often centered on court-created frameworks, rather than statutory text.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_21_20_VI.html">Title VII</a> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the cornerstone civil rights legislation, has broad operative language. Under its terms, an employer cannot "otherwise ... discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" because of such individual's protected trait, such as sex. The statute further prohibits employers from limiting or classifying employees in any way which would "deprive or tend to deprive" any individual of employment opportunities or "otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee" because of a protected trait.</p>

<p>The courts have interpreted this language by dividing and subdividing it into several types of discrimination. For example, courts often describe cases as raising intentional discrimination claims or disparate impact claims. Intentional discrimination claims, also referred to as disparate treatment claims, are further subdivided into individual claims and pattern-or-practice claims. Courts require plaintiffs proceeding on a pattern-or-practice claim to demonstrate that discrimination was the standard operating procedure of the company with respect to a certain group of employees.</p>

<p>Under Title VII, disparate impact describes the idea that a facially neutral policy has a disproportionate impact based on a protected trait. For example, a policy that requires all employees to be taller than six feet would disproportionately affect women. If such a policy was not justified by adequate reasons, it could lead to disparate impact liability under Title VII.</p>

<p>In <em>Dukes</em>, the majority opinion characterized the underlying claims by reference to court-created doctrines, with scant reference to Title VII itself. The majority opinion viewed the plaintiffs as alleging that Wal-Mart's subjective wage and promotion criteria created a disparate impact based on sex. It also characterized the case as alleging that Wal-Mart engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination by being aware of the disparate impact and doing nothing about it. Later in the majority opinion, the Court noted that in order to proceed in the class action format the plaintiffs need to allege the same type of discrimination across the class.</p>

<p>The majority opinion thus required plaintiffs to funnel their discrimination claims into silos of discrimination: a disparate impact claim and a pattern-or-practice claim. Using the majority's rationale, the plaintiffs were not able to bring their suit as a class action because the central idea of a pattern-or-practice claim requires a unified policy and the notion of subjective decision making is contrary to this idea. One of the most striking features of <em>Dukes</em> is how little attention the Court pays to the actual text of Title VII.</p>

<p>What the majority opinion failed to consider is that Title VII's statutory language does not mandate that plaintiffs' claims fit within these separate frameworks. The pattern-or-practice construct is a court-created idea. It is a judicial gloss placed on Title VII and one that is not mandated by the statute's language, at least with respect to litigation brought by private plaintiffs.  </p>

<p>The disparate impact framework also stems from court-created doctrine. In 1971, the Court recognized disparate impact claims in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</a> and developed a framework for disparate impact claims in subsequent cases. Even though Congress later codified the idea of disparate impact in a separate statutory provision, this provision does not require that all cases based on statistical disparities proceed through the disparate impact framework. Nor does the statute provide that a plaintiff may not establish discrimination by showing that an employer is aware of skewed employment data and refuses to change its practices. Plaintiffs can establish discrimination by using the disparate impact or pattern-or-practice frameworks, and in this sense the frameworks might be helpful to courts. However, these frameworks are not the only way to establish a viable discrimination claim. Title VII's language provides a broader potential legal landscape than what is currently reduced to legal frameworks. </p>

<p>The facts of <em>Dukes</em> look different when viewed through the statutory language than those same facts look when funneled through court-created frameworks. In the case, the plaintiffs alleged that pay and promotion decisions were left to a nearly all male managerial workforce and that when these decisions were considered in the aggregate they heavily favored men. The plaintiffs described a "tap on the shoulder" promotion process in which managers often did not publicly post available job vacancies. The plaintiffs alleged that managers often assumed women would be unwilling to relocate to obtain promotions. Plaintiffs' data showed that women filled 70 percent of the hourly jobs at Wal-Mart, but made up only a third of management employees. According to the plaintiff's <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/EE-CA-0303-0003.pdf">Third Amended Complaint</a>, [PDF] these statistics were vastly different than the management statistics for Wal-Mart's competitors. </p>

<p>The pay procedures gave managers a band within which to pay hourly workers, but allowed wide discretion about how to pay individual employees within the established spectrum. The plaintiffs presented data showing women are paid less than men in every region of the country. This statistical evidence was supported by anecdotal evidence from numerous women. In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that women were often placed into job assignments that were less likely to receive higher pay.</p>

<p>For private litigants, the statutory language does not ask whether these facts can be funneled into a pattern-or-practice claim. Nor does the statutory language ask whether Wal-Mart acted intentionally with respect to women. Rather, it asks whether women were otherwise discriminated against with respect to their compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment because of their sex or whether the employer limited them in ways that deprived them of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affected them because of a protected trait.</p>

<p>The majority's need to funnel discrimination cases into court-created frameworks is especially troubling because these frameworks fail to capture the full range of potential discrimination. Although the courts have never considered whether the recognized tests represent the complete range of potential liability under the discrimination statutes, the courts often act as if the available tests represent the only options available to plaintiffs. Given that the courts created many of these frameworks in the 1970s and 1980s, many of them fail to incorporate newer ideas of structural discrimination and do not reflect more modern understandings of how cognitive bias operates. Further, they fail to describe how corporate intent might interact with individual intent to create liability for the employer.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs in <em>Dukes</em> do not allege a traditional discrimination claim, and the facts of the case do not fit neatly into any of the traditional frameworks. It is an interesting question whether these facts state a claim under Title VII's statutory language. To answer this question, however, courts and litigants must stop pretending that court-created frameworks represent the only way of proceeding under the discrimination statutes.</p>

<p>Admittedly, this question is even more difficult to answer at the class action certification stage, where it is uncertain how much the court is supposed to be considering the underlying merits of the action. The largest class action in history likely does not provide a good backdrop for also considering difficult questions about how court-created frameworks interact with Title VII's statutory language. </p>

<p>However, <em>Dukes</em> does provide a concrete example of how the use of frameworks may alter the outcome of litigation. Whether the facts in <em>Dukes</em> are deemed to be legally cognizable discrimination heavily depends upon the legal framework through which the facts are viewed. It is time to consider whether courts are using a lens that reflects the full potential of Title VII's statutory language.<br />

Analysts and observers disagree about the <a href="http://www.usip.org/publications/counting-the-costs-somali-piracy">root causes of crimes at sea</a> off the Somali coastline. Some argue that it is a legitimate response by local groups to poverty, poaching and pollution, while others believe it is an extension of apparent lawlessness on the land. Regardless of its perceived origin, there is some consensus that the worrying trend of increasing maritime crime and rising violence must be addressed. The immediate response has been to defend transiting vessels, deter attacks and defeat armed gangs militarily. Even though naval vessels from over a dozen countries, including China, India and the US, currently patrol the Gulf of Aden under the aegis of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force in the Horn of Africa, incidents of hijacking, theft and sometimes violent attacks have been on the increase. Voicing his frustration, a retired four-star admiral in the US Navy quipped "if you can't rule the waves, you must waive the rules." He was partly lamenting the lack of enforceable laws and effective courts in this part of the world.</p>

                <p>UN Security Council Resolution 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">calls on Somalia and its neighbors</a> to take urgent steps to address legislative and judicial shortcomings that make it difficult to deal with growing maritime insecurity in this region. The resolution mandated the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and UN Development Programme to consult with national and regional authorities in the Horn of Africa to determine what is needed to promulgate the requisite laws, establish capable courts, enhance prison capacity and provide technical assistance. The resolution targets those who plan, organize, facilitate, finance or profit from maritime crime. Conceptually, this is clearly an important step in the right direction. Operationally, it is fraught with a number of difficulties.</p>

                <p>First, maritime crime in the Horn of Africa presents a rather complex conundrum because it entails a combination of "brown water" offenses, those committed within Somalia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and "blue water" offenses, those committed on the high seas &#8212; actual piracy. Addressing legislative deficiencies related to "brown water" crimes might be relatively more straightforward than the complexities related to international maritime law. This is partly why it costs an <a href="http://oneearthfuture.org/images/imagefiles/Cost%20of%20Piracy%20Final%20Report.pdf">estimated $250,000 to try a single Somali pirate in European courts</a> [PDF]. Second, the regional characteristics of maritime crime in and around Somalia necessitate the harmonization of national laws against maritime crime. The combination of limited state capacity and paranoia in Somalia and some of its neighbors will make issues like the "right of hot pursuit" difficult to solve. Significant diplomatic effort must be expended before any regional harmonization can be contemplated. Third, efforts should be made to reconcile and avoid potential conflicts between international and national maritime legislation. For example, the "freedom of navigation" and "right of innocent passage" clauses in international maritime law could pose problems for national legislators, eager to enact robust anti-piracy laws. Fourth, while it is clearly necessary for the legislative framework to be all-embracing, available research suggests that only the foot soldiers are likely to be apprehended in and around Somalia. Those benefiting the most, like the financiers and facilitators, reside outside the sub-region and are likely to be unaffected. As long as they continue to have the capacity to fund and support groups willing to perpetrate maritime crime, the mass of unemployed Somali youth are more than likely to gamble on a big payday.</p>

                <p>The legal and judicial reform envisaged in this initiative could help deter maritime crime in the Horn of Africa if it is <a href="http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/sites/default/files/preview_of_oceans_beyond_piracy_strategic_review.pdf">complementary, coordinated and comprehensive</a> [PDF] &#8212; complementary in the sense that it is viewed and implemented as part of a broader package of reforms that speak to the multifaceted causes of maritime crime in Somalia (to include improved law enforcement capacity, economic development and political reconciliation); coordinated to the extent that it facilitates the collection and sharing of information; and comprehensive to the extent that it effectively targets all actors in the chain of events that result in maritime insecurity in this region, especially those providing funding and control. Failure to do this will lend some credence to the assertion that Resolution 2015 is primarily about reducing the cost and burden of piracy trials on non-regional countries and not about meaningfully contributing to ending the scourge of maritime crime in and around Somalia.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Hua Wang, <a href="http://www.law.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University School of Law</a> Class of 2012, writes on the need for policies that combine market incentives with outright prohibitions to achieve enforcement and compliance with international environmental regimes...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/huawang.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>A</strong></font> regulatory framework allows countries to solve environmental problems that inherently are similar and conducive to centralized decision-making and coercion. Transboundary environmental issues, such as global warming and acid rain, have no readily calculated market value and mandates are often need to change a state's behavior. </p>

<p>Engaging states and relevant actors from the beginning and keeping them engaged strengthens national compliance with international environmental regimes. Effective implementation will occur if countries or industries see compliance as serving their interests. Germany, for instance, supported the <a href="http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/lrtap/full%20text/1979.CLRTAP.e.pdf">Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution</a> [PDF] when its Black Forest was threatened with acid rain. Russia and Norway complied with the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> to ease political tension in the Barents Sea. Various nations were motivated to become signatories of the <a href="http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NOS/ORR/TM_NOS_ORR/TM_NOS-ORR_17/HTML/Pribilof_html/Documents/THE_FUR_SEAL_TREATY_OF_1911.pdf">Fur Seal Treaty</a> [PDF] upon realizing that the industry would not survive without international protection. As nations become parties to treaties, they take important steps to implement and comply with them. Affected actors participating in the decision making process increase the efficiency and equity of the solution and ensure the responsiveness of negotiations to all relevant parties.     </p>

<p>Coercive measures, including sanctions, penalties and withdrawal of privileges under the convention, are sometimes effective in eliciting compliance. The <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/">World Heritage Convention</a> downgrades sites that are not conserved and the <a href="http://www.unep.org/ozone/pdf/Montreal-Protocol2000.pdf">Montreal Protocol</a> [PDF] removes fund eligibility for countries that do not provide baseline data. Coercive measures create a latent threat against noncompliance and counteract the significant rewards of free riding. Transparency and punishment alter actor incentives by making it costly to defect and advantageous to cooperate and receive political credit for environmental responsibility.</p>

<p>In some cases, environmental regulations can have negative effects on environmental quality. Incentives often exist to circumvent agreements by making performance look attractive. The former Soviet Union, for example, systematically exceeded international quotas and deliberately misreported kills to the International Whaling Commission. Although it is often collectively desirable to reduce environmental degradation, the temptation to free ride leads states to define their interests unilaterally and avoid international cooperation.    <br />
 <br />
Countries that have long land borders have great difficulty controlling smuggling and black markets. The large number of actors and coastal zones in the marine pollution regime and the large number of potential violators of the <a href="http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.php">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna</a> (CITES) make it difficult to enforce the treaties. The incentive to engage in black markets, coupled with enforcement difficulties, greatly reduces the effectiveness of a trade ban.     </p>

<p>While CITES has decreased poaching in areas where law enforcement was heavily augmented by external funds, these funds are drying up and black markets are flourishing. The economic rewards of hunting endangered elephants for their ivory have skyrocketed. Ivory has gone from $200 to $2,000 a kilogram. Without sufficient funds and control mechanisms, CITES can better curb international trade in endangered species through a combination of punishment and incentives. The trade ban creates an undesirable situation where species hover at the brink of extinction and people are forced to absorb the large costs of policing an ineffective ban.</p>

<p>Flexible market schemes provide incentives for real progress in minimizing environmental degradation. Cost advantages arise when those who can achieve reductions in pollution most cheaply make the greatest adjustments. Pollution taxes and user fees discourage environmental degradation by strengthening incentives for waste and pollution reductions and generating revenue for public environmental protection. In climate change, the complexity of multiple pollutants and millions of emitters involved in controlling CO2 substances illustrate a need for market incentives. To finance the costs of sustainable forest management, taxes can be charged on logging and the revenue uses to fund reforestation. Certification and environmental labeling increase the demand for sustainable goods and allow consumers to encourage responsible fisheries management.</p>

<p>Economic instruments provide the means for internalization of environmental degradation and resource depletion costs in a flexible and efficient way. Market incentives can result in sharply reduced compliance costs and ensure that all parties to a convention have both a strong intention and a strong capacity to comply. In cases where a country may intend to comply but place a low value on environmental priorities, market incentives can build capacity and positively change the country's views on compliance. Incentive-based systems are often more effective in securing compliance from developing countries that lack the financial resources and the institutional capacity needed to undertake the improvement of far-reaching environmental problems. Without the political and economic infrastructure needed to enforce regulations or check the accuracy of required documents, less wealthy countries need to more fully develop property rights in order to create incentives for sustainable management.<br />
     <br />
By providing incentives for early action, wealthy countries can achieve targets with minimal economic costs. Market-based mechanisms often smooth the transition to national targets and enhance a wealthy nation's capacity to meet the target during the compliance period. The market mechanisms in climate change provide the needed flexibility for developed countries to comply with treaty commitments, and to facilitate interaction between the public and private sectors. The relatively low-cost reductions of private investments to developing countries are a feasible substitute for the more expensive domestic reductions in industrialized countries.</p>

<p>Many developing countries lack the infrastructure needed to achieve local environmental objectives, and to contribute to the resolution of global environmental concerns. By making available technical assistance and capacity-building programs at the local and national levels, less wealthy countries could more readily comply with their obligations and contribute to the perceived equity of the treaties. Furthermore, countries with insufficient expertise and capital would have the support needed for domestic efforts to reduce environmentally damaging behavior. </p>

<p>Advanced technologies from multinational companies allow developing nations to become regional market leaders in sustainable energy methods, and to achieve development goals in a less environmentally-damaging fashion. In climate change, because private investments in poor countries are cheaper than domestic reductions in rich countries, the cost-effectiveness of environmental aid and the ability of industrialized countries to finance the effort further enhance the probability that the transfers will live up to expectations. Transboundary pollution requires an effective regulatory system that combines restrictive rules and penalties with positive incentives. The combination of market-based instruments with administrative regulations creates flexibility in pollution control investments and is often more successful than outright prohibitions alone. Tradable permits are ideal for transboundary pollution problems with many small polluters and only a few large lawbreakers. Pollution trading and individual transferable quotas achieve conservation at a cheaper cost than absolute mandates and promote efficient use of the scarce resource.</p>

<p>Total allowable catches in international fisheries presented too many loopholes, such as misreporting, and the practice is largely discredited by the fishing industry. The lack of individual ownership created cost externalities and individual incentives to take more fish than is collectively rational. The conventional regulatory approaches, including limited seasons and net size, cause fishermen to put out more boats or buy more costly equipment, but do not ease the pressure on fish stocks. Tradable fishing rights, on the other hand, create a mutually beneficial quota exchange by cushioning the transition to the new international fishing regime, restoring stocks to sustainable levels and increasing fishermen's profits. The cap-and-trade approach to over-fishing creates sustainable harvests by distributing individual fishing permits on the basis of historical participation in the fishery, and allowing individuals to buy or sell shares. This mechanism works because fishermen are able to reduce fishing costs and minimize ecological damages caused by too many boats chasing too few fish.</p>

<p>Enticing economic incentives provide many communities with a stake in local conservation. Clear and enforceable property rights prevent environmental degradation by providing strong incentives for preservation. In CITES, many members are shifting away from trade prohibitions to create positive incentives for environmental protection. Zimbabwe's Community Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources has achieved double the reduction in elephant poaching necessary for sustainable management. It generates revenues from legal elephant hunts and returns some of the money to villages and individual households as incentives for sustainable management. Recognizing the value of their wildlife, local villagers have established anti-poaching squads to protect elephants for the future. The assignment of property rights to local communities can provide resource-owners with an incentive to protect endangered species and reduce enforcement costs. </p>

<p>Opponents of market incentives oppose the idea of creating "rights" to pollute and to allowing rich countries to buy their way out of domestic reductions. Some developing countries distrust market principles because of their negative implications for national sovereignty. They fear that investors' economic motivations conflict with social and environmental development. In trying to maximize profits, developed countries might dictate the direction of projects, overlook the benefits of existing technology in developing nations and focus on large-scale, centralized projects that do not serve the rural poor. The gap between the seller's goal of monetary gain and the beneficiary's goal of development create conflicting objectives and tension. <br />
       <br />
Improperly constructed and executed mechanisms may be ineffective and will underachieve either through outright internal collapse or the inability to approach the cost savings that such mechanisms promise. Because developing countries vary in their industries, ownership and culture, the design and enforceability of economic instruments must incorporate local conditions and not borrow standards from other countries that have more capacity or capital at their disposal. The likelihood of agreement between the global North and South depends on improving commercial incentives for private investors that bear all the costs and commercial risks of technology transfers.</p>

<p>Market-based mechanisms present large uncertainties in the potential costs and approaches to achieving reductions, while transboundary environmental problems pose special challenges to the internalization of externalities. The Clean Development Mechanism, defined in the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf">Kyoto Protocol</a>, has run into problems in measuring emissions, establishing baselines for taxes and building agreement about allocation of taxes. In the ozone regime, emission permits did not work efficiently when the cost of finding buyers and sellers was high, or when a market leader used its market power to engage in monopolistic behavior.  </p>

<p>Although it is very difficult to improve the design of market mechanisms, there are several conditions that contribute to its success. Equity must be incorporated into the design of any market system, if the system is to meet its promise of delivering a successful, market-based strategy for meeting environmental obligations. Instead of a one-time "parachute drop" of new equipment, industrial countries need to provide the necessary infrastructure for the long-term success of development projects. Multinational companies must assess local socioeconomic conditions to determine whether there is sufficient market demand and local support for successful adoption.</p>

<p>To achieve environmental aims, there needs to be clear and verifiable guidelines on reporting and accountability mechanisms for international taxes and emissions trading. Without these protocols, market schemes will suffer from a lack of confidence in its fairness and accuracy. A legal framework and executive body of North and South representatives must be established to monitor the effectiveness of new investment, quantify progress and assign liability for failed projects. </p>

<p>Traditional regulations allow relatively little flexibility in the means of achieving environmental goals and rely too heavily on monitoring, enforcement and a complex administrative system. While this has protected the environment, it has resulted in a policy framework that is rigid and costly and its effectiveness in further improving the environment may be diminishing. International environmental problems that involve a huge number of small and diverse sources of pollution do not easily lend themselves to command-and-control regulation. In these cases, a combination of markets and mandates are needed to create sustained efforts at environmental protection. </p>

<p>A proven pathway to environmental protection lies through ensuring that environmental policies are compatible with economic incentives. The performance of market-based instruments for environmental protection provides evidence that these approaches can achieve major cost savings while accomplishing their environmental objectives. Both regulators and the regulated community must move beyond simple pollution control to focus on preventing pollution at its source. </p>

<p>Although the threat of punishment forces many countries to comply with strict regulations, the integration of regulatory control and market-based mechanisms often create more efficient and cost-effective results. Long-term environmental progress requires a flexible, results-oriented approach that gives people the ability to act as private stewards of the environment. A hybrid system of flexible economic instruments and command-and-control regulations can correct market imperfections and avoid rigid and bureaucratic rules.</p>

Cardozo School of Law</a> Class of 2013, is a Staff Editor for the <a href="http://www.cardozoaelj.com/">Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Journal</a>. He writes on the possible outcome of <em>Yves Saint Laurent v. Louboutin</em>, which is on appeal in the Second Circuit, and its potential impact on the fashion industry...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/markguffanti.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>F</strong></font>ashion items generally do not have strong protection under trademark law. Rather, the law affords certain "conceivably separable" elements of an item protection under copyright or patent law. For example, a distinctive lace pattern could be copyrighted or a unique design element may fall under the purview of patent law. However, trademark law can be used to protect product packaging. Tiffany's trademark-blue, the Burberry check or the Gucci stripes are all examples of trademarked packaging. Even though trademark rights are limited for fashion items, they do present their holders with a strong legal tool that protects their goods from imitators. </p>

<p>Trademark law ensures that consumers can identify a good's source. In order to qualify for registration, a mark must be distinctive and used in commerce. Under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_22.html">Lanham Act</a>, nearly anything capable of carrying meaning can qualify as a symbol or device, and thus as a mark. Marks are classified along a continuum as either generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary or fanciful. Generic marks are the only class of marks not protected under trademark law. The red outsoles of the Louboutin shoes qualify as a descriptive mark, as descriptive marks may include shapes, sounds, smells and even colors. Descriptive marks are protectable, but only with proof of secondary meaning. The burden is on the owner of the mark to show that overtime consumers have come to associate a particular color with a particular brand, causing the color to identify the source of the product.</p>

<p>A product feature cannot be registered if the feature is functional. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17905304466595211702">Qualitex v. Jacobson</a>, the US Supreme Court held that a product feature qualifies as functional if it is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if it impacts the cost or quality of the article. Prohibiting the trademark of functional product features encourages competition by keeping producers from controlling a useful product feature. The Court in <em>Qualitex</em> explained that if functional product features were trademarked, than competitors would be put at a significant non-reputational disadvantage.<br />
 <br />
The theory of aesthetic functionality states that consumers desire a specific feature that is not part of the use or purpose of the product itself. Aesthetic functionality was at issue in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1385365327243048989">Jay Franco &amp; Sons v. Franek</a>, when the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit cancelled a federal trademark registration that claimed the circular beach towel. The court held that, "[g]ranting a producer the exclusive use of a basic element [such as color] impoverishes other designers' palettes." The court explained the more basic and general the element "the more likely it is that restricting its use will significantly impair competition."<br />
 <br />
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has adopted its own aesthetic functionality test. Under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11788624685878475108">Wallace International Silversmiths v. Godinger Silver Art Co.</a>, aesthetic functionality hinges on whether "trademark protection would significantly hinder competition by limiting the range of adequate alternative designs, the aesthetic functionality doctrine denies such protection." The Second Circuit also eliminated a per se rule in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11518243566326954589">Villeroy &amp; Boch Keramische Werke v. THC Systems</a>, which qualified china patterns as aesthetically functional. </p>

<p>Recently, Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) began selling a line of monochromatic shoes, including four styles of an all red shoe with a matching red bottom. As a result, Christian Louboutin filed suit against YSL for trademark infringement, false designation of origin and dilution. YSL counter-claimed for cancellation of Louboutin's federally registered trademark for "lacquered red sole on footwear." Louboutin moved for a preliminary injunction, but was denied by Judge Victor Marrero of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. He noted that the court would likely find Louboutin's trademark not protectable and subject to cancellation. He held that, "the Court cannot conceive ... recognition of a trademark for the use of a single color for fashion items." The crux in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2013261766487275555">Louboutin v. Yves Saint Laurent</a> is whether or not Louboutin's lacquered red sole is a functional product feature. Judge Marrero opined that because in the fashion industry color serves ornamental and aesthetic purposes, which are vital to competition, it is unlikely that Louboutin will be able to prove that its red outsole is entitled to trademark protection.<br />
  <br />
It seems unlikely Louboutin will prevail on appeal, so long as no error in the application of law is found. The court will likely cancel Louboutin's broad registration because it poses significant trademark and policy issues. Furthermore, even with no finding of error, it is likely that the Second Circuit will dismiss Judge Marrero's finding that a trademark should never be granted for the use of a single color for fashion items, as a broad per se rule against color trademark in fashion conflicts with <em>Qualitex</em> and contradicts the Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendment Act. If the Second Circuit does find an error in the application of the law, it will still likely rule this case narrowly and require that Louboutin prove his trademark is not overly broad.</p>

<p>Though red-soled shoes almost instantly conjure up the name "Louboutin" for casual fashion consumers, a broad prohibition against red would be anti-competitive. Louboutin identified his signature color as Pantone No. 18-1663 TP or "Chinese Red." And while YSL allegedly has never used this particular color on its outsoles, without a narrow description of what the trademark protects, Louboutin, and more importantly the courts, cannot determine where the line of infringement ends and competition begins. Without a narrow construction, Louboutin would hold a monopoly on shoes with red outsoles. Louboutin incorrectly asserted on his trademark registration that only he uses red on the soles of shoes. However, as YSL pointed out, red has been used on shoe soles for centuries. Furthermore, both YSL and Valentino have used red for shoe soles in the past.</p>

<p>If the court establishes that Louboutin has a valid and protectable trademark, it will rely on the factors identified by the Second Circuit in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2293827617926067028">Polaroid Corporation v. Polarad Electronics Corporation</a> to determine whether YSL infringed the trademark. The <em>Polaroid</em> factors only apply in the Second Circuit, though other circuits have similar variations. The factors include:<ul><li>the strength of plaintiff's mark;</li><li>the degree of similarity between the products;</li><li>the proximity of the products or services; </li><li>the likelihood that plaintiff will bridge the gap;</li><li>evidence of actual confusion;</li><li>the defendant's good faith in adopting the mark or lack thereof;</li><li>the quality of defendant's product or service;</li><li>and the sophistication of the buyers.</li></ul>Of the eight factors, none alone are dispositive. The flexible nature of the factors permits courts significant discretion in applying them. Therefore, most factors can be construed to favor one party or another. Though the court has significant discretion, Louboutin has persuasive factors in the strength of its marks and the degree of similarity between the products. </p>

<p>In order to receive broad protection, Louboutin should have waited for an imitator to use a red-sole with a contrasting shoe color. By bringing the suit against YSL's monochromatic shoes, Louboutin forced the court to address aesthetic functionality as to whether or not other companies can fairly and effectively compete for prospective consumers without using red on their shoes. This forced the court to opine that in fashion a depletion of colors would be anti-competitive in nature, and thus impermissible. The manner in which Louboutin framed the issue by pursuing a monochromatic shoe may lead the court to afford a much narrower protection to Louboutin than an action against a closer imitation of a Louboutin shoe.</p>

<p>There may be some concern that Louboutin could endanger itself by becoming a generic mark. Both <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>New York Post</em> have published highly publicized articles on the emergence of cobblers painting their customers' shoes red and nail salons offering a "Louboutin" treatment by painting the underside of customers' nails red. The continuing reference to anything with red on the underside should be of significant concern to Louboutin. </p>

<p>The <em>Louboutin</em> case demonstrates both the best and worst of trademark law. On one hand, trademark law should have rewarded Louboutin for the effort expended in building his brand and achieving secondary meaning. The decision also reflects that trademark law has been contextual. Though people can cite the various single color trademarks, including brown for UPS trucks and Tiffany's blue product packaging, fashion presents a position where courts should consider the depletion theory. </p>

<p>The Second Circuit should provide a narrow protection for Louboutin. He did not exert significant effort in attempting to create a recognizable trademark; rather he was attempting to create something aesthetically pleasing. It would be detrimental for fashion if designers could not create monochromatically red shoes or red-soled shoes without the fear of litigation. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the competitive disadvantages of enforcing this trademark will outweigh the advantage of reinforcing both Louboutin's registered mark and the effort exerted by Louboutin in achieving secondary meaning.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Johnson/">Kevin Johnson</a> of the University of California Davis School of Law says that Alabama's immigration law highlights the civil rights implications of the recent state immigration laws and, in the case of Alabama, show parallels with previous efforts to prevent desegregation...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kevinjohnson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>arlier this year, the state of Alabama, the site of many iconic episodes of US civil rights history, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">passed</a> what many observers believed &#8212; and state political leaders bragged &#8212; was the toughest state immigration law in the US. This is no small feat. In the last five years, the nation has seen a flood of progressively tougher state and local immigration laws, including those passed in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, all states that have experienced a recent growth in their Hispanic population. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act</a> (HB 56) includes a hodge-podge of enforcement-oriented immigration provisions. One provision, common to many modern state immigration laws including Arizona's legislation, is that local police who lawfully stop a person are required to verify their immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" that the person may be in the nation unlawfully. HB 56 also includes a novel provision, Section 28, which requires public elementary and secondary schools in Alabama to determine if an enrolling student (1) was born outside the jurisdiction of the US or is the child of an unlawfully present alien and (2) qualifies for assignment to an English as second language class or other remedial program.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">challenged much of the Alabama immigration law</a> on the ground that it was preempted by federal law and usurped the federal power to regulate immigration, as it has in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">South Carolina</a>. The district court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-enjoin-most-of-alabama-immigration-law.php">enjoined four provisions</a> from going into effect. An appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is pending, with a stay <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">barring two provisions</a> from going into effect during the appeal, including Section 28 (which the district court did not enjoin).</p>

<p>Alabama is not the first state to act with respect to the public education of undocumented elementary and secondary school students. For years, state and local governments have chafed at their obligations under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12010798883027065807">Plyler v. Doe</a> to undocumented schoolchildren. In 1994, California voters passed Proposition 187, an initiative which would have denied access to the Golden State's public K-12 schools for undocumented children. That strategy, designed to provoke the Supreme Court to revisit and overrule <em>Plyler v. Doe</em>, failed. A federal court enjoined the core provisions of Proposition 187 from going into effect. Tough budgetary times have offered Alabama an excuse for renewing in different form the challenge to <em>Plyler v. Doe</em> and the educational rights of undocumented students.</p>

<p>On November 1, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-warns-alabama-schools-on-state-immigration-law.php">sent a letter to Alabama school districts</a> requesting information to ensure that the civil rights of immigrant schoolchildren, as well as others, are not adversely affected by HB 56. The <a href="http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1710">letter</a> states, in part, that:<blockquote>It has come to our attention that the requirements of Alabama's H.B. 56 may chill or discourage student participation in, or lead to the exclusion of school-age children from, public education programs based on their or their parents' race, national origin, or actual or perceived immigration status, or based on their homeless or foster care status and consequent lack of documentation.</p>

<p>As you know, in <em>Plyler v. Doe</em>, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the Supreme Court held that a State may not deny a child equal access to public education based on his or her immigration status. Noting the "pivotal role of education" in our society, <em>id</em>. at 221, the Court concluded that denying innocent children the benefit of schooling provided to other students within the district was unconstitutional. <em>Id</em>. at 230. On May 6, 2011, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education issued guidance on the Federal obligation to provide equal educational opportunities to all children residing within your district.</blockquote>The letter proceeds to request information from the school districts about the race, national origin, and English Language Learner status of students who have withdrawn from school or have unexplained absences or a pattern of absences, and enrollment data for the last few years.  </p>

<p>Section 28 is part of an omnibus immigration enforcement bill that is designed to make life so difficult for undocumented immigrants, many of which are Mexican, that they leave the state. From a civil rights perspective, Perez's letter expresses the concern that Section 28 might "chill" undocumented students from attending public school as guaranteed by <em>Plyler v. Doe</em>. The Alabama schools' much-publicized collection and reporting of data has alarmed immigrant students, lawful and unlawful. Absences are up, enrollments are down.</p>

<p>Students may be discouraged from attending public schools for fear of disclosing their, and/or their parents', immigration status information. They might well fear that if the information is collected and reported, then it might end up in the hands of immigration enforcement authorities resulting in their removal from the US. This fear among undocumented immigrant students and parents is not far-fetched given the harsh national debate over immigration and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-deported-400000-illegal-immigrants-in-2011-dhs.php">record-setting deportations</a> each year.</p>

<p>Alabama undoubtedly would deny that it has any desire to inhibit anyone from exercising their civil rights. Section 2 of HB 56 offers some indication of the legislative intent behind Section 28 stating, in relevant part, that:<blockquote>Because the costs incurred by school districts for the public elementary and secondary education of children who are aliens not lawfully present in the United States can adversely affect the availability of public education resources to students who are United States citizens or are aliens lawfully present in the United States, the State of Alabama determines that there is a compelling need for the State Board of Education to accurately measure and assess the population of students who are aliens not lawfully present in the United States, in order to forecast and plan for any impact that the presence such population may have on publicly funded education in this state.</blockquote>States also could arguably want student immigrant status information for planning purposes and for determining their costs in educating undocumented students so that they can better lobby for support from the US government, which is primarily in charge of immigration. However, a legal and political goal appears to be at the forefront of reasons for Section 28. Michael Hethmon of the Immigration Law Reform Institute, which seeks to reduce illegal and undocumented immigration to the US, is the reported drafter of Section 28 and has claimed that its goal is to collect the data he believes necessary to overturn <em>Plyler v. Doe</em>. This, of course, suggests a lack of concern with the exercise of rights of undocumented children under that case.</p>

<p>In the end, Perez has put Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/DOJ-tells-Alabama-it-has-authority-to-compell-public-school-enrollment-data.php">on official notice</a> that the US government will be watching Alabama and its treatment of immigrants and Hispanics. Oddly out of touch with US civil rights history, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange has questioned Perez's authority to ask for basic enrollment information from the school districts. Such objections highlight for the nation the civil rights implications of the Alabama immigration law and remind people of the parallels between HB 56 and Alabama's strident &#8212; at times, violent &#8212; stand against African Americans seeking to desegregate the public school system in the 1950s and 1960s. Unfortunately, until Congress enacts some kind of comprehensive immigration reform or the Supreme Court makes clear what role the states have, if any, in immigration enforcement, the nation can expect state legislatures to continue to pass immigration enforcement laws like Alabama's.</p>

The courts will be sorting through the claims, counter-claims, appeals and cross-appeals for years. The corporate social responsibility issues faced by British Petroleum (BP), its partners, vendors, agents and other associates will no doubt serve as research fodder for dozens, and possibly hundreds, of legal publications in the coming decade.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/072010wunstellsuit.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] in <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/louisiana/laedce/2:2011cv01542/146743/">Blanchard v. BP America Production Company</a> states that BP entered into a contract in May 2010 with plaintiff, a restaurant and catering operation in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. The restaurant was to provide meals and catering services for BP cleanup crews operating in the area. However, BP allegedly breached the contract, refused to pay for services provided and hired a competing catering operation. The plaintiff seeks actual damages around $20,000, services and legal fees around $200,000 and nearly $2,000,000 in lost future business under the contract. While the case is ongoing, the implications of the suit as they relate to corporate social responsibility present a variety of issues. In addition to the damage BP has already caused on the Gulf Coast, it has now allegedly breached contracts with local small businesses, causing further economic harm.   </p>

<p>BP has experienced its ups and downs in the public eye. In 2000, BP and legendary advertising firm Ogilvy &amp; Mather launched the ongoing "Beyond Petroleum" campaign to spruce up its corporate image and tout its dedication to green energy investment. In 2005 and 2007, BP placed in <em>Multinational Monitor's</em> top ten worst companies of the year. At the same time, CNN Money reported that <em>Fortune Magazine</em>, in partnership with AccountAbility and CSRNetwork, declared BP the top "most accountable" company in 2007 and the second "most accountable" in 2006. <em>Adweek</em>, a prominent marketing and advertising industry publication, and <em>Mother Jones Magazine</em>, one of the largest paid circulation liberal publications, both blasted BP for long engaging in a questionable practice known as "greenwashing."</p>

<p>Greenwashing is one of the best examples of how the tenets of corporate social responsibility are self-contradictory. In this practice, a company focuses some resources on popular socially beneficial goals, focuses more resources on advertising its new socially responsible efforts and continues ignoring less popular but equally socially valuable goals, such as worker safety and disaster prevention. The practice illustrates the innate opposition of profit motive and social responsibility. By allowing and encouraging self-regulation and voluntary measures, we leave society defenseless against manipulation and unprotected from large informational disparities. Corporations are founded for the purpose of seeking and making profits, and they should be left to it, while the government should be charged with regulating corporate behavior. </p>

<p>The government is most aptly situated to protect society from unscrupulous practices perpetrated by corporations. The government enforces contracts, provides remedies for their breach, ensures that workers are paid wages and not treated too harshly and protects our natural resources from contamination and depletion. Unfortunately, the government reacts slowly to particular situations. For example, the government took 25 years to implement and enforce fair, logical intellectual property rights for computer programs. Unfortunately, the gap between invention and regulation is frequently filled with degrees of human suffering. For a modern example that bridges the gaps between cultures, look to economies that were or are shifting from agriculture to industry: 1800s England or modern day China. The socioeconomic upheaval inspires a variety of social and political perspectives. For some, it is a story of hardship, hazardous working conditions, subsistence wages and abuse of the working class. For others, factory life is a relief from the abuse of the landed gentry and fickle weather, a small measure of mobility and a glimmer of hope for advancement. Regardless of perspective, the government must intervene in order to ensure a fair deal between labor and management, to curtail the worst offenses to decency and to legislate a modicum of morality.</p>

<p>Corporations would have us believe that "corporate social responsibility" can replace government intervention. Corporate social responsibility refers to the idea that a company should self-regulate its behavior and engage in socially beneficial activities at its own expense. In reality, it is a label like "green" or "organic," which means different things to different corporations, and with no standard definition or enforcement, it becomes just another marketing ploy. It convinces you to shop at one store instead of another. It makes you feel good about spending money on something unnecessary made overseas. It is a reason you should have warm and fuzzy feelings for the chemical conglomerate that poisoned your lake a few years ago or the oil company responsible for the latest spill. Looked at in the most base and crass light, it may not even be marketing so much as tainting the jury pool.</p>

<p>Turning a skeptical eye to the corporate social responsibility apparatus may be equally illuminating. We must consider who controls the policies and how and why they were developed. We further need to determine if companies take proactive steps to improve these policies once already in place. When companies take the proper steps, it is possible for them to effectively practice corporate social responsibility. However, all too often programs are designed through market research, as a response to negative press, or a lawsuit, or a function performed by the public relations staff to protect the integrity of the corporate brand. In these cases, the social good of the programs may be material, but they do not actually promote the cause of corporate social responsibility.</p>

<p>Extrapolating further, we can deduce that many of these programs may merely be cases of greenwashing, little more than public relations insurance policies against the next disaster. These programs promote corporate negligence. A few percentage points of profits given away buy as much good will as a more expensive investment in worker safety or environmental remediation. Further, a company may simply wash its hands of a questionable business practice by outsourcing it to a less scrupulous subcontractor and claiming ignorance if allegations of wrongdoing arise, as appears to have occurred with the Deepwater Horizon disaster. </p>

<p>It is axiomatic that there is no such thing as charity in business. Basic accounting principles state that for every liability there must be an equal and opposite asset. In this case, cash given to charity is offset on the balance sheet by increases in goodwill and tax savings. We must consider where a company gets the money it uses for corporate social responsibility. Naively, we may be told that the company pays for its policies through its own profits. However, the profits do not belong to the company; they belong to its owners. In a private company, this hardly matters, as the owners are the company and they can give as they choose.</p>

<p>For a public company, it is customers, and not the shareholders, who pay for the programs. Nobel Prizes in Economics have hinged on the notion that investors are good at making self-serving decisions and dislike when their investments make their decisions. In most instances the company passes the cost of charity on to the consumer through increased prices. Make no mistake; the 5 percent of pre-tax profits being charitably donated by certain big box discount stores raises prices accordingly. Effectively, this unilaterally pledges the consumer's support to the charity on the company's terms, and it does so in lieu of causes the consumer might prefer to support, if they were aware and motivated to do so on their own. Finally, the programs suffer from a lack of transparency, as consumers are generally disconnected from the process of determining which charities to support, and, if it occurs, have no oversight to scrutinize how the funds were spent once disbursed. The company asks the customer to take it on faith that their activities actually happen, and actually have a social benefit, leaving the door open for more greenwashing.</p>

<p>Corporations should be charged with doing what is in their nature&#8212;providing goods and services that people want, at a cost the market will bear, while the government should be charged with regulation. Despite the electronic communication and organization tools available today, the free market is too mindful of popular causes to adequately deter evildoers. Laws already exist to protect us from gross corporate fraud and negligence. For industries that operate behind veils of secrecy, we can only keep pressuring the government to adapt. Ultimately, it is the government, in response to society's needs, which must continue to set the standards for corporate behavior, to create a common definition of corporate social responsibility and to oversee enforcement. Encouraging dubious corporate self-regulation of social behavior leaves us worse off, because we, as the consumers, are ultimately paying for it. Furthermore, self-regulation of social behavior has the unfortunate side effect of lulling everyone into a false sense of security.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/fac/hu">Margaret Hu</a> of Duke University School of Law says that the recently enacted state-level immigration laws go against long-held American ideals and cultural values, which were exemplified in the World War II-era film <em>Casablanca</em>...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/margarethu.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Department of Justice (DOJ) recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">filed a lawsuit against South Carolina</a>, challenging the state's <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">strict immigration law</a>. The DOJ has now challenged the constitutionality of three state immigration laws: <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, and South Carolina. Critics of these laws call them "racial profiling" laws or, more aptly, "show me your papers" laws because they require all immigrants to carry their documents with them at all times for production on demand by state law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>These lawsuits and others are winding their way through the courts and the Supreme Court will likely have the final say. These laws have already sparked a widespread cultural protest. Some have already controversially compared them to Nazi Germany, where Jews were required to carry papers. However overstated or inappropriate the comparison, and whatever the outcome of the legal challenges, passing a law that requires people to show their papers on demand does not seem to sit right with American culture. To understand the source of our cultural discomfort, all we need to do is watch <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KGOB1WIjRs">Casablanca</a></em>.</p>

<p><em>Casablanca</em> was based on the play <em>Everybody Comes to Rick's</em> by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. The source of the phrase "show me your papers" was based on Burnett's real-life encounters with Nazi officials. During a 1938 European vacation, Burnett witnessed first-hand the discrimination and persecution of the early days of Hitler's fascism. On his return to the US, he started writing a Broadway play that communicated an anti-Nazi, anti-isolationist message through positioning the plight of the political refugee in the actual, real-time crisis he had just seen unfolding in an alarming anti-Semitic context. By 1940, <em>Everybody Comes to Rick's</em> took the form of a three-act play, containing a plot and character sketch that eventually would be adapted into the <em>Casablanca</em> screenplay.</p>

<p>The main theme of the story, communicating the plight of the refugee, is conveyed in the opening scenes. The camera pans to the modern equivalent of an immigration raid as the police round up the political refugees and herd them into police vans, giving rise to another iconic line from <em>Casablanca</em>: "Round up the usual suspects."</p>

<p>Next, we see an officer who stops a "suspected" political refugee on the street and asks: "Can we see your papers?" The refugee bolts and is shot in the back after the officer declares, "These papers expired three weeks ago!" Within the context of unrestrained police powers, "your papers, please" is wielded like a weapon. It serves its purpose well in <em>Casablanca</em>, one of the first World War II war propaganda films produced by Hollywood in cooperation with the US Office of War Information's Bureau of Motion Pictures. As a symbol of corrupt, unchecked unilateral power, the phrase embodies something worth fighting against. After <em>Casablanca</em>, many World War II films began incorporating "your papers, please" as a film trope. The phrase evolved into an enduring cultural metaphor that concisely and viscerally conveys what we are not about here in America. This message still resonates today.</p>

<p>By the time we get to the end of the film, awash in a sea of fedoras and trench coats, the fog resplendent as a stylish film noir accessory, it is easy to forget that the plot revolves around immigrants and "papers." Putting the love triangle aside, the plot unfolds within the context of a political meta-narrative: the desperate plight of political refugees from a war-torn Europe who lack the good fortune, wealth or connections to possess their "papers." The film portrays the exiled and persecuted of all nationalities trapped in Vichy-occupied Morocco, devising escape schemes to the US, which symbolizes a dream of freedom. <em>Casablanca</em>, ultimately, is about immigrants seeking hope and redemption from discretionary abuses of power and the arbitrariness of having one's life and fortunes tied to the necessity of having the right "papers."</p>

<p><em>New York Times</em> film critic Aljean Harmetz explains the film's enduring appeal this way: "There are better movies than Casablanca, but no other movie better demonstrates America's mythological vision of itself." With the passage of "show me your papers" laws in Arizona, Alabama and South Carolina, among other states, state lawmakers are starting to run afoul of this vision, triggering a popular backlash. Sustained cultural protest to these laws preserves our vision of ourselves and what America should be.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/aronson/index.php">Bruce Aronson</a> of Creighton University School of Law says that recent corporate scandals in Japan highlight the need for the reform of that country's corporate governance structure, just as the Enron case did in the US...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/brucearonson.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>I</b></font>t  has been two tough years for Japanese corporate governance. In 2010 Toyota's <a href="/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">slow response to car recall issues</a> raised questions about the governance of Japan's most highly respected company. The Tohoku Earthquake of March 11, 2011 cast a harsh light on preparedness and decision-making at Tokyo Electric Power Company, formerly Japan's financially strongest company, which subsequently found itself in financial ruin.  </p>

<p>A recent, still unfolding, scandal over financial reporting at Olympus Corporation may be the worst of all. Like the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enron">Enron</a> case in the US, it raises fundamental concerns about the accuracy of financial reporting and the role of outside audit firms in Japan. It has prompted global institutional investors to vigorously renew their criticism concerning a lack of transparency and accountability in Japanese corporate governance.</p>

<p>Problems at Olympus, a maker of cameras and medical devices, came to light in connection with a $2 billion acquisition of a British company, Gyrus Group Plc. Michael Woodford, a long-time British employee and the new company president, began to raise questions about extraordinarily high advisers' fees of $687 million paid by the company to obscure Cayman entities as part of that transaction. He was promptly fired and then went public with his concerns. There was much speculation in Japan as to why Olympus would pay exorbitant fees that did not pass "the smell test," including the possibility of an organized crime connection. It turns out that the reality was more prosaic, but even more troubling, due to the possibility that this may not be an isolated case.</p>

<p>What apparently occurred at Olympus was an extreme case of failure to recognize securities losses, or old-fashioned "<em>tobashi</em>" (literally "flying") that occurred with disturbing regularity in Japan in the 1990s. When the Japanese bubble burst around 1990, the Tokyo stock market lost some three-fourths of its value and many Japanese companies were stuck with very large securities losses (since, unlike US companies, many of them hold substantial portfolios of publicly-traded stocks on their balance sheets). <em>Tobashi</em> simply means that such bad assets are shuffled, sometimes repeatedly, or "fly" to another company's balance sheet, either to a friendly securities company or to the company's own subsidiary, so that the problem securities never appear on the company's balance sheet at the end of any accounting period.</p>

<p>In the case of Olympus, it appears that before the change to mark-to-market accounting standards in Japan in 2000, the company transferred its bad securities to a Cayman subsidiary. It later sought to deal with the unrecognized losses in this subsidiary, thought to total over a billion dollars, by using vastly inflated mergers and acquisitions advisory fees. These fictitious fees were presumably included in the acquisition price, which can be written down gradually over a 20-year period. It is truly amazing that such huge losses could be concealed and continue as a heavy financial burden on the company for (presumably) over 20 years. It also means that Olympus's securities filings may well have contained false financial statements for a 20-year period, which must be a new world record.</p>

<p>This case is reminiscent of Enron in that it seems clear that, going forward, the accuracy of financial statements and the role of outside auditors and the board of directors will be closely scrutinized. As in Enron, we can expect to hear the cries of "Where were the gatekeepers?" and "Where was the board?"</p>

<p>It appears that one outside auditor did object at one point to the treatment of these securities losses in the financial statements of Olympus and was replaced by another outside auditor. Two of the major Japanese audit firms (both affiliates of the Big Four accounting firms) are now under government investigation.  </p>

<p>As in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.03763:">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</a> that followed the Enron case, we can anticipate that additional regulation of audit firms may receive increased attention. The example of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in the US is one possible model. Although it is an extreme example, the Olympus case serves as a reminder that all countries continue to wrestle with a system under which the company itself can choose (and dismiss) its most important gatekeeper &#8212; the outside auditor.</p>

<p>The Olympus case is also important for the ongoing debate in Japan concerning independent directors. Japan has been slowest in incorporating the concept of independent directors, even compared to other countries in Asia such as South Korea and China. Olympus actually did relatively well on this count, having three outside directors among a total of 15. As in the Enron case, outside directors were not effective in preventing serious accounting fraud by corporate management. It is highly unlikely that the Japanese will respond with a Sarbanes-Oxley approach that requires a majority of independent directors for public corporations. Japanese companies are attached to the notion of directors who are thoroughly familiar with the company's business and remain skeptical of the value of outside directors to the corporation.  </p>

<p>Given the results in Olympus, perhaps institutional investors and others concerned with good corporate governance practices should broaden their focus beyond the number of independent directors and their "degree" of independence. Maybe there should be greater consideration given to providing outside directors with the tools they need to act independently and fulfill their role of monitoring management. Chief among these tools is assuring a good information flow, both internally in terms of establishing and maintaining adequate information and reporting systems, and externally in terms of required public information disclosure. Both would tend to increase the effectiveness and value of outside directors and help overcome traditional corporate cultures in Japan that zealously guard corporate information and remain excessively inward-looking.  </p>

<p>Following the Olympus scandal, foreign investors have escalated their criticism of Japanese corporate governance practices that they have long thought to be inadequate. It is too early to tell what, if any, new reforms will be initiated.  However, ensuring the accuracy of financial statements is a fundamental issue of corporate governance, and there should be a meaningful Japanese response. Information flow is another basic issue that may, in fact, broadly link the recent corporate governance failures at Toyota, Tokyo Electric and Olympus. As such, it cries out for immediate attention.</p>

		<title>Continued Dysfunction Marks Guantanamo Bureaucracy</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/dixon,-j.-wells">J. Wells Dixon</a>, Senior Staff Attorney for the Guant&#225;namo Global Justice Initiative at the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, says there is a systematic dysfunction within the bureaucracy of the Guant&#225;namo Bay detention facility that impacts the capability of attorneys to adequately represent their clients...<br><hr height="1"><br><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-lawyers-charged-with-defending.php">seizure and review of attorney-detainee legal materials</a> by officials of the Joint Task Force Guant&#225;namo is disturbing. Anyone remotely familiar with the adversarial legal system in the US knows that a jailor cannot sift through privileged information to reveal a prisoner's confidential defense strategies. Any first-year law student knows why this is especially improper in the context of a death penalty case. What is unknown is why this event occurred at Guant&#225;namo now, particularly given the government's admission that it was "not in response to any particular security threat." The likely answer is there was no principled reason. Having traveled to Guant&#225;namo numerous times over many years to meet with men detained there, it comes as no surprise to me that someone, somewhere in the bureaucracy of Guant&#225;namo, ordered a disruptive and ultimately needless examination of legal papers and correspondence kept by detainees, including materials clearly marked as privileged.  Bad decisions and pointless exercises abound at Guant&#225;namo, often for no apparent purpose. Indeed, little changes at Guant&#225;namo except the rules and procedures about legal mail, what you can say and do, what paperwork is required, what box must be checked, and so forth. The only certainty from month-to-month is there will be some new administrative obstacle for lawyers to overcome in order to represent their clients.  </p>

                <p>If the government cannot figure out "small" issues such as the proper handling of legal mail, it is unclear how it will address complex substantive matters, such as the contradiction in its claim that terrorist suspects who attack coalition forces are war criminals triable by military commission because they are not soldiers with a right to engage in belligerency, yet CIA drone pilots, <a href="/forum/2011/10/morris-davis-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">who also lack combat immunity</a>, may legally target citizens of Pakistan and Yemen (including children) with Hellfire missiles under the laws of war.</p>

                <p>It is important to consider that January 11, 2012, will mark the 10-year anniversary of Guant&#225;namo. For nearly a decade, the US has held about 800 men and boys in a prison that was designed to be outside the protections of any law. All were Muslim, few have been charged with any offense and none has received a fair trial. There are currently 171 men still imprisoned at Guant&#225;namo and 89 have been unanimously approved for transfer by all relevant military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The identities of the cleared men remain inexplicably withheld from the public, however, and no one has actually been transferred within the last year except an Algerian who was forcibly repatriated despite his fear of persecution in his home country. Others have commented that, for the cleared men, as well as the 36 slated for prosecution and the 46 who will be held indefinitely, Guant&#225;namo has become "The Forever Prison."</p>

                <p>The military commissions, which recently ruled that the seizure and review of capital defendant Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri's legal mail infringed his rights, also underscore the dysfunction of Guant&#225;namo. The military commission system was designed to serve only one purpose: to manufacture predetermined guilty verdicts for Muslim men who have been dehumanized and rendered unworthy of the protections provided by the US Constitution and laws, including international law. After nearly a decade of false starts, the commissions are notable only for convicting a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">chauffeur</a>, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/khadr-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">child</a> and a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-jury-convicts.php">video propagandist</a>, none of whom is responsible for the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">attacks of September 11, 2001</a>. Who will be next, a Taliban cook, or perhaps an al Qaeda gardener? The consistent missteps and false starts at Guant&#225;namo raise the question of what President Barack Obama is trying to achieve there at this point &#8212; Guant&#225;namo is a fiasco by any measure.  </p>

                <p>Recent events of the so-called "<a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a>" also bring new perspective to the failures of Guant&#225;namo. Across North Africa and the Middle East, men and women are demanding widespread political and social change. They are rejecting the vestiges of old authoritarian regimes which have long oppressed them &#8212; torture, indefinite detention, unfair military trials and impunity &#8212; the very features that Guant&#225;namo was created to embody and which persist there today. It is ironic, and hypocritical, that the US claims to be the world's leading democracy, but when it comes to Guant&#225;namo the country lags behind students marching and dying in the streets of Sana'a and Damascus. </p>

                <p>Guant&#225;namo Bay demeans the US and should be closed, yet the government continues to dither about and obstruct lawyers' ability to represent their clients.</p>

Wade</a>, the Supreme Court advanced the privacy rights of women by holding that a woman has the right to an abortion until the point of fetal viability. Even after the point of fetal viability a woman could have an abortion if her health or life were at risk. The Court held that the states had an obligation to preserve the health and privacy rights of women by making abortion safe and legal while also acting in the "best interests" of the fetus. The Supreme Court established, as a matter of law, that neither the state nor the federal government can provide a fetus rights superior to those of the pregnant woman. Writing for the Court, Justice Blackmun explained that "the word 'person,' as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, does not include the unborn." </p>

<p>In the opinion Justice Blackmun wrote:<blockquote>Texas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.</blockquote>After discussing various religious beliefs, he settled on viability of the fetus as the point at which the state and federal government have the legal ability to intervene and act to protect the fetus even over the desires of the mother, except if the mother's life or health is at risk. He concluded that, "the right, [to an abortion] nonetheless, is not absolute, and is subject to some limitations; and that, at some point, the state interests as to protection of health, medical standards, and prenatal life, become dominant." He also stated that, "[i]n areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth, or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth."</p>

<p>In <em>Roe</em> Texas argued, unsuccessfully, that life begins at conception and that the mother, therefore, can have no right to abortion. In the time following <em>Roe</em> various groups tried to reverse the decision but have not been successful. Now, there is a new attack on <em>Roe</em>. This approach can be seen most clearly in the federal and various state Unborn Victims of Violence Acts and the proposed "personhood" bills in various State legislatures. The federal <a href="http://www.nrlc.org/Unborn_Victims/UVVAEnrolled.html">Unborn Victims of Violence Act</a> recognizes a "child in utero" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of certain federal crimes of violence. The law defines "child in utero" as a member of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. Although the act makes exceptions for abortion, claiming that a fetus, once conceived, is a child is clearly at odds with <em>Roe</em>. The "personhood" laws that have been introduced seek to establish, as a matter of law, that once an egg is fertilized a person exists. On November 8, Mississippi voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-voters-reject-personhood-amendment.php">turned down a proposed constitutional amendment</a> that defined a person as every human being from the moment of fertilization. The Colorado-based group advocating for the amendment, Personhood USA, is pushing for similar bills on the 2012 ballots in Florida, Montana, Ohio and Oregon. Voters in Colorado rejected similar proposals in both 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">2010</a>. Michigan and several other states have also proposed similar laws. </p>

<p>In thinking about these "personhood" bills, there are two basic issues to consider. First, what are the medical facts about conception and personhood? Second, what are the legal implications of a "personhood" law?</p>

<p>The medical facts are that a fertilized egg, if it implants into a uterus, can grow and become a fetus; but, the fertilized egg only attaches to the uterine wall in about two-thirds of the cases. Further, In vitro fertilization allows the process of fertilization to occur outside the uterus, meaning that fertilized eggs can be created and maintained ex utero with no chance of ever implanting unless they are placed into a uterus. Some scientists argue, from a religious basis, that human life begins at the moment of fertilization since from that point on a human being could develop. Other scientists argue that human life begins when the embryo attaches to the uterus or when the heartbeat begins. </p>

<p>Of course, this question of when life begins is not the same as asking when an embryo should be granted the same rights as a born person. Jaclyn Friedman of Reproductive Biology Associates, the in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic in Atlanta, Georgia, commissioned a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn15062-when-does-human-life-begin.html">poll</a> asking respondents when human life began in a biological sense of being an original entity. "We didn't ask when it's a person," she says. "There's a distinction between when a group of cells is considered living, and when it deserves human rights, and that's what comes into play with this amendment."</p>

<p>To the extent that courts have considered this matter, it has been in cases where a state has tried to force a woman into mandatory bed rest, or even a C-section, because that procedure may be in the best interest of her fetus. In the leading case, <a href="http://174.123.24.242/leagle/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=19901808573A2d1235_11799.xml&docbase=CSLWAR2-1986-2006">In Re A.C.</a>, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that "courts do not compel one person to permit a significant intrusion upon his or her bodily integrity for the benefit of another person's health ... We hold that in virtually all cases the question of what is to be done is to be decided by the patient &#8212; the pregnant woman &#8212; on behalf of herself and the fetus." Thus the court recognized, as did the Court in <em>Roe</em>, that a competent living individual ought to have rights superior to the embryo or fetus.</p>

<p>Therefore, what are the implications of a personhood law? If an embryo once created, even ex utero, is a person then:</p>

<ul><li>The parents may be able to claim a tax deduction for minor children,</li><li>IVF may be illegal since in the case of embryos with lethal conditions, or embryos no longer wanted for reproduction purposes, they are currently destroyed and in some cases they may be damaged by the IVF process,</li><li>Some forms of birth control that prevent implantation, such as IUD's or the morning-after pill, would be illegal, and perhaps all forms of contraception would be illegal since they could be said to inhibit the creation of a human being,</li><li>Women would lose their constitutional rights to make decisions about their own bodies and lives,</li><li>If a woman had an ectopic pregnancy or some other condition where it was medically necessary to end the pregnancy for the health of the women, that may be prohibited or, at least, place the physician and patient at risk for criminal prosecution,</li><li>Any such law would be challenged since it is in direct conflict with <em>Roe</em> thereby forcing a decision at the US Supreme Court,</li><li>Women would be seen as "transport and delivery systems," where their primary function during pregnancy, whether planned or accidental, is to produce a living child no matter the medical condition of the child or the desire of the women to have a child. This would be true even if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or if the fetus was shown to have a lethal condition,</li><li>Women that have stillbirths or miscarriages could be prosecuted for murder,</li><li>And no embryonic stem cell research would be allowed, since creation of an embryonic stem cell line is done by removing the inner mass from an embryo thereby destroying reproductive capacity. This would be true even if the fertilized egg were medically inappropriate for reproductive use because it carried a lethal disease and even if the persons who created the embryo no longer wanted to use it for reproductive purposes. Under the law, they would be prohibited from asking that it be destroyed and would have to pay to keep it in a freezer forever.</li>
</ul>While some believe that personhood laws will restore a "culture of life" in America, others worry that fertilized eggs will be granted rights superior to the women who bear them. Creating "personhood" for fertilized eggs would dehumanize born human beings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.louisville.edu/faculty/jim_chen">Jim Chen</a> of the University of Louisville Louis D. Brandeis School of Law says that the recent court decision allowing Sprint and Cellular South to pursue antitrust claims against the proposed AT&amp;T and T-Mobile merger is an important step toward halting what could be a major anticompetitive development in the wireless industry...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/forum/jimchen.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n a pivotal antitrust decision, Judge Ellen Huvelle of the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-allows-sprint-antitrust-suit-against-att-t-mobile-merger.php">has allowed Sprint and Cellular South to pursue their suits</a> to enjoin AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile. These suits pose a significant barrier to the merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. The ability of Sprint and Cellular South to pursue their claims represents a modest but important victory against the domination of the American wireless industry by an emerging AT&amp;T/Verizon duopoly.</p>

<p>Sprint and Cellular South's lawsuits complement the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-files-antitrust-suit-to-block-att-t-mobile-merger.php">US government's suit</a> to block the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger. The Department of Justice's complaint emphasizes the traditional elements of a claim arising under Section 7 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_1.html">Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914</a>. The government's case against the proposed union of the second and fourth largest wireless carriers in the US draws heavily from the familiar arsenal of antitrust weapons against anticompetitive mergers. According to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard measure of industrial concentration, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile would command the single largest share of the US wireless market and an overwhelming share in many metropolitan markets. AT&amp;T's acquisition of T-Mobile would eliminate potential competition and foreclose future entry by one of the country's peskiest and most creative wireless carriers.</p>

<p>In many merger cases, the contribution of antitrust law begins and ends in the US Department of Justice. No matter how substantially a proposed merger may lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, competitors of the combining firms face formidable barriers that often prevent them from suing under Section 4 or Section 16 of the Clayton Act. The antitrust injury doctrine requires competitors to prove that they have not merely sustained some economic loss, but have suffered injury of the sort that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. The need to show antitrust injury sometimes forces competitors to allege that the merged firm would engage in predatory pricing, a theory of antitrust liability that can be difficult to prove. Two recent Supreme Court decisions, <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/supreme-court-rules-in-telecom.php">Bell Atlantic v. Twombly</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2004/01/supreme-court-bars-antritrust.htm">Verizon Communications v. Trinko</a>, raise additional obstacles to antitrust plaintiffs, especially in suits alleging anticompetitive conduct in the telecommunications industry. <em>Twombly</em> requires plaintiffs to plead facts with sufficient particularity so that a court can find it plausible, and not merely imaginable, that defendants violated the antitrust laws. <em>Trinko</em> holds that violations of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:s.00652:">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a>, strictly of their own force, do not constitute antitrust violations. Plaintiffs must prove conduct that offends the antitrust laws, independent of their lawfulness under the Telecommunications Act or the implementing regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>

<p>The magnitude of these barriers to suit heightens the importance of Judge Huvelle's decision to allow Sprint and Cellular South to pursue their suits against AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile. Any antitrust suit in which competitor-plaintiffs successfully deflect a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule12.htm">Rule 12(b)(6)</a> motion to dismiss represents a legally noteworthy development. An antitrust plaintiff that clears the Rule 12(b)(6) hurdle has shown antitrust injury and has satisfied both <em>Twombly</em> and <em>Trinko</em>. That plaintiff has pleaded facts that give rise to a plausible theory of antitrust liability beyond the violation of any applicable FCC regulations. That is exactly what happened in <em>Sprint Nextel Corp v. AT&amp;T Inc.</em> and <em>Cellular South, Inc. v. AT&amp;T Inc</em>. To fully appreciate Judge Huvelle's decision in these cases, we must first understand the economic and technological terms by which American wireless carriers compete.</p>

<p>Sprint and Cellular South's involvement in the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger is important precisely because this controversy is no ordinary story of industrial concentration. The proposed creation of America's largest wireless carrier has economic significance transcending its $39 billion price tag. The private suits against AT&amp;T's bid for T-Mobile mark a significant step in the development of antitrust law, especially as applied to an industry as technologically intense as wireless communications. In three decades, the American wireless industry has come a very long way from its origins in first-generation (1G) wireless technology and the breakup of the Bell system. 2G wireless technology enabled the first wave of data transmission. Even more significantly, the expansion of the 2G spectrum gave American consumers something they had not enjoyed in either wireline or wireless communications: meaningful choice from a broader spectrum of carriers competing on price and on service. The third generation of wireless technology brought mixed blessings. What consumers gained through faster speeds and enhanced services, they lost to creeping concentration as the country's leading carriers, Verizon and AT&amp;T, increased their shares of the market. Technological incompatibility between the leading 3G protocols has allowed Verizon and AT&amp;T as duopolists to operate their own wireless ecosystems, insulated from fiercer levels of competition that could and should prevail in this industry.</p>

<p>Many American consumers now treat their wireless devices as their primary or even exclusive vehicle for voice communications. It is no longer enough to speak of phones or even of "smartphones" that bridge the conventional gap between voice and data. Americans transmit an astonishing volume of information over wireless networks. The most sophisticated wireless devices and applications designed for those devices give consumers all sorts of intelligent ways to enjoy, create, transform and share content. Wireless devices and networks have liberated consumers from the geographic constraints inherent in legacy wireline technology. Consumers expect &#8212; and deserve &#8212; the ability to travel with complete confidence that they can call and be called, that they can navigate the World Wide Web and manipulate applications and content, with no perceptible reduction in the level of service they enjoy at home.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, we can understand the true significance of Sprint and Cellular South's suits against the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger. Increased concentration in any industry tends to amplify the power of the largest firms &#8212; especially a firm that would be created by a merger that has come under antitrust scrutiny &#8212; to gouge consumers by raising prices and lowering the quality of the product or service provided. But a conventional application of antitrust injury doctrine holds that the ordinarily expected increase in price inflicts no anticompetitive harm on competitors, as distinct from consumers. For this reason, the concentration and market share data so central to the government's case would not be enough, standing alone, to enable Sprint and Cellular South to block the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger.</p>

<p>Sprint and Cellular South successfully alleged that AT&amp;T's acquisition of T-Mobile would impair competing wireless carriers' access to critical inputs. By far the most important input in the American wireless market, today and for the foreseeable future, is access to the best wireless devices. Postpaid wireless subscribers &#8212; customers who subscribe to service for longer terms, as distinguished from pay-as-you-go prepaid customers &#8212; are less sensitive to price than they are to the availability of the best, most technologically sophisticated devices. Unlike their counterparts in many other developed countries, American wireless subscribers almost invariably buy their devices from wireless carriers. American carriers regularly subsidize device purchases by their postpaid subscribers, in exchange for a long-term service commitment. Even when consumers buy devices at department stores or electronics boutiques, those vendors usually operate in cooperation with a wireless carrier and bundle the devices with service contracts by that carrier. Empowered by the bundling of devices with service subscriptions, the largest carriers in the US have progressively tightened their grip over the market for wireless devices. Apple's iconic iPhone and iPad epitomize the problem. For years, AT&amp;T held an exclusive on the iPhone; no other carriers' customers could buy this sleekest and smartest of handheld devices. You can buy an iPad at an Apple store, but the market for data service plans to feed that iPad offers exactly two choices: AT&amp;T or Verizon.</p>

<p>In allowing Sprint and Cellular South to pursue their Clayton Act claim against the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger, Judge Huvelle astutely recognized the <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/oligopsonistic">oligopsonistic</a> potential of the merged firm to further constrict an already tight market for cutting-edge wireless devices. AT&amp;T and Verizon, the country's largest wireless carriers, use their buying power to command exclusive access to devices such as the iPhone. At the very least, these large carriers demand (and receive) long periods of exclusivity at the beginning of the economically and technologically significant life of new devices. The addition of T-Mobile to AT&amp;T would exacerbate a serious and legally objectionable constraint on the ability of Cellular South, other small carriers, and even a carrier as large as Sprint (the country's third largest) to offer devices on par with AT&amp;T and Verizon. Permitting this merger would compound these competitors' most pressing problem: being consigned to an unappetizing selection of older phones at higher prices. Judge Huvelle correctly characterized the problem as one of "merger-to-<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/monopsony">monopsony</a>." Creating the country's largest wireless carrier would cement AT&amp;T's unlawful grip over the devices that are driving and will continue to drive competition among wireless companies.</p>

<p>A second input also played a significant role in these competitor suits. Roaming is the only way that a smaller carrier such as Cellular South, especially one with a geographically circumscribed network, can assure its customers of coast-to-coast coverage. Without commercially reasonable roaming agreements, a smaller carrier cannot serve subscribers who travel outside their home service areas. Judge Huvelle recognized the potential of a combined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile to inflict anticompetitive injury on Corr Wireless, a Cellular South subsidiary that has met stiff resistance in its efforts to forge roaming agreements on commercially reasonable terms with these larger carriers. This conclusion, in many respects, flows more naturally than the merger-to-monopsony theory by which Judge Huvelle recognized Sprint and Cellular South's allegations of injury in the device market. Antitrust cases more routinely involve anticompetitive conduct by defendants as sellers. Roaming agreements involve precisely that: would-be roaming partners sell access to each other's networks.</p>

<p>Judge Huvelle's decision did fall short in certain respects. She appears to have misunderstood the scope of competing carriers' need for roaming. 3G wireless technology is balkanized between Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) protocols. The incompatibility of GSM and CDMA technologies has forced carriers to choose between 3G protocols and to fashion their 3G roaming arrangements according to that choice. Sprint and Cellular South have operated 3G networks on the CDMA protocol. That choice has presumably led both of these carriers to seek 3G roaming agreements with Verizon, the country's leading CDMA carrier, as opposed to AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, both of which have developed their 3G networks along the competing path of GSM technologies. Incompatibility in 3G networks, however, is of no moment when wireless carriers seek roaming on the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) protocol that represents the fourth generation of wireless technology. The proposed merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile will enable this combined firm, to say nothing of Verizon, to obstruct 4G roaming in ways exceeding their existing refusal to cooperate with requests for roaming access to their legacy 3G networks.</p>

<p>On balance, however, Judge Huvelle's decision represents a very significant legal victory for competition in the American wireless industry. Preventing further concentration among wireless carriers preserves a competitive foothold by which Sprint, Cellular South, and other carriers can continue to offer consumers viable options beyond AT&amp;T and Verizon. Nevertheless, domination of wireless communications by these two large carriers continues to pose serious economic threats. Notwithstanding their modest size, smaller carriers such as Cellular South have captured meaningful slices of the 700 megahertz "beachfront" spectrum that provides the best technological platform for deploying fully functional 4G/LTE networks. Properly managed, the transition between third- and fourth-generation wireless technologies promises to liberate American wireless communications, at long last, from the balkanization that has robbed 3G wireless of its full technological potential. The division between GSM and CDMA protocols has enabled AT&amp;T and Verizon to keep cultivating a cozy duopoly in which two and exactly two dominant wireless carriers can lock their respective subscribers inside insulated wireless ecosystems. A wireless duopoly means that carriers outside the AT&amp;T and Verizon ecosystems will have no access to cutting-edge devices, to say nothing of roaming, and will consequently be marginalized to the point of commercial extinction. The impact on all layers of the wireless industry, from radio access network equipment, chips and consumer devices to operating systems, applications and content, would be nothing short of devastating. Competition and consumer choice in wireless communications depend on full inter-operability at all layers and evenhanded access to crucial inputs such as devices and roaming. Judge Huvelle's decision, though by no means the final battle in a war that has only begun, represents a significant victory for competition and consumer welfare in the broader market for wireless equipment, services and content.</p>

The Supreme Court of Canada recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/canada-high-court-refuses-to-hear-abdullah-khadr-appeal.php">refused to review</a> a permanent stay of extradition proceedings against Abdullah Khadr. Lower courts had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/canada-court-orders-release-of-khadr-brother.php">ruled</a> that "gross misconduct" by the US in arranging and prolonging Khadr's detention in Pakistan justified the extraordinary remedy of a stay of proceedings. The Supreme Court's refusal to consider this case means that Khadr will not be extradited to the US, where he has been indicted on charges of material support of terrorism for allegedly supplying arms and explosives to be used against US forces in Afghanistan. It is possible, but not probable, that Canadian authorities will prosecute Khadr, who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/canada-court-orders-release-of-khadr-brother.php">released in August 2010</a> after four-and-a-half years of pre-extradition custody and has still not been charged in Canada. </p>

<p>Abdullah Khadr is part of Canada's infamous Khadr family, self-professed supporters of al Qaeda. His father was a close associate of Osama Bin Laden and one of his younger brothers, Omar Khadr, remains in Guantanamo where he <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/khadr-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> to various charges, including the murder of an American soldier. Abdullah Khadr was captured by the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate in Pakistan in October 2004 after the US posted a $500,000 bounty for his capture. The fact that the US paid such a bounty was secret until it was <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2008/2008fc549/2008fc549.html">revealed in a decision</a> by a Canadian judge in related state secrets proceedings and only after a Canadian newspaper was initially enjoined from publishing the information. The judge stressed that while the US had not agreed to the release of information about the bounty, "[i]t is now more than three years since the information was received by Canadian officials, the general practice is in the public domain, no human source would appear to be at risk and the circumstances in Pakistan have changed since these events took place."</p>

<p>Khadr was held for 14 months in a secret Pakistani detention center without access to counsel or courts. He was denied consular access to Canadian officials until January 2005. In August 2010, a Canadian extradition judge found that Khadr was denied access by Pakistan and the US acting "in concert" in an attempt to facilitate interrogation by US intelligence. Khadr alleged he was tortured in Pakistan, but the judge found that these allegations were not established because of inconsistencies in his story. He did, however, find that Khadr was physically abused by Pakistani officials, but not by the FBI.</p>

<p>In June 2005, the Pakistani authorities were prepared to release Khadr, concluding that they had gained all the intelligence from him that was possible. The <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/2bxr8">judgment</a> for Khadr's extradition hearing states that, just before Khadr's planned release, a Canadian Security Intelligence Service officer "received a phone call from his American intelligence counterpart telling him the US agency disagreed with and was concerned about plans to repatriate Khadr to Canada," and that the "US believed Khadr still posed a threat and that releasing him at this point was not a wise course of action."</p>

<p>In July 2005, FBI agents interviewed Khadr in Pakistan. Afterwards, the US apparently attempted, without success, to persuade Pakistani officials to allow Khadr to be rendered into their custody. In November 2005, "a senior United States official" asked Canada to consent to further delay in Khadr's release so that the US officials "could 'get their act together' with respect to extradition plans." The Canadian officials, perhaps mindful of the <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/canadian-opposition-calls-for-expanded.php">controversies</a> caused by delays in Maher Arar's return, refused and Khadr was released to Canadian consular officials and flown back to Canada by the end of the month.<br />
 <br />
The FBI maintained their interest in Khadr, sending the same two agents who had interviewed him in Pakistan to interview him in Toronto with representatives of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) present. The Canadian extradition judge excluded the results of the Toronto FBI interview because he found that they were derived from the interviews that the same FBI agents had conducted with Khadr in Pakistan. In those interviews, Khadr admitted to supplying al Qaeda with machine gun rounds, grenades, rockets and explosive material to be used against American and coalition forces.</p>

<p>The strong actions of the Canadian courts in staying the extradition request in the Abdullah Khadr case can be contrasted with the Supreme Court of Canada's <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-high-court-rules-government-not.php">refusal to uphold an order</a> that Canada be required to request Omar Khadr's repatriation from Guantanamo because of concerns that such a remedy would interfere with Canada's conduct of diplomacy with the US.</p>

<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ontario-appeals-court-refuses-to-extradite-terror-suspect-to-us.php">upheld the stay of the extradition proceedings</a> in part by relying on British authority that had stayed proceedings in the case of irregular extradition, a result quite different than reached by the US Supreme Court in <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/us-supreme-court-rejects-use-of-alien.htm">US v. Alvarez-Machain</a>. The Ontario court held that the alternative of excluding the statements taken by the FBI in Pakistan and Toronto would fail to disassociate the court from the "'gross misconduct' that could not be remedied by anything short of a stay of proceedings." In an unanimous and eloquent judgment by Justice Robert Sharpe, the Court of Appeal stressed that "the rule of law must prevail even in the face of the dreadful threat of terrorism" and even when it "serves in the short term to benefit those who oppose and seek to destroy" such values. In this respect, the judgment can be seen as part of Canadian repudiation of America's irregular tactics in its war on terror.</p>

<p>There are, however, some troubling aspects in the case. The decision to stay extradition proceedings against Abdullah Khadr led to his release after four-and-a-half years of pre-extradition custody in Canada. Two judges <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2006/2006canlii585/2006canlii585.html">had denied</a> Khadr bail because of concerns that, given his and his family's history, he might flee the jurisdiction and because of public statements made by Abdullah Khadr in February 2004 that indicated admiration for the 9/11 terrorists and dreams of becoming a martyr. In this sense, the case may again trigger concerns in the US that Canada may not take a tough enough approach to terrorist suspects.</p>

<p>The Ontario Court of Appeal dealt with some of these concerns in its judgment. It rejected the Canadian government's "emotive argument that because of what the extradition judge did, an admitted terrorist collaborator is allowed to walk free" as "unfounded" because of the seriousness of the abuse, and also noted that Khadr could be prosecuted in Canada under the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=Bill&Doc=C-36&Language=e&Mode=1&Parl=37&Ses=1">2001 Anti-Terrorism Act</a> for acts of terrorism that are committed outside of Canada. This is true, but no charges have been laid against Abdullah Khadr since his release and Canadian courts have already held that his statements in Pakistan are inadmissible because of his mistreatment there. Any Canadian prosecution would also be complicated by the reluctance of both Pakistani and American officials to release information.</p>

<p>It is likely that the Supreme Court's decision not to review the stay in Abdullah Khadr's case will place as much, if not more, strain on Canadian-American security relations &#8212; given the seriousness of the allegations against Khadr and the apparent reluctance of Canadian officials to prosecute him &#8212; than would have a request by Canada for Omar Khadr's repatriation. Canadian courts were prepared to take a stronger remedial position in this case where Abdullah Khadr was within their jurisdiction than in the Omar Khadr case where he remained within American jurisdiction. </p>

<p>The Abdullah Khadr case demonstrates that extradition from Canada will not be dominated by concerns about comity towards states requesting extradition. It follows in the tradition of the Supreme Court's 2001 decisions that Canada <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/2001/2001scc19/2001scc19.html">should not extradite</a> without assurances that the death penalty will not be applied and that it <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/2001/2001scc7/2001scc7.html">not extradite</a> in a case where an American prosecutor hinted that a fugitive might be raped in an American prison if he contested the extradition request.</p>

<p>The Abdullah Khadr case also has echoes of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arar-rendition-suit.php">Maher Arar affair</a> given the apparent attempts by American officials to have Abdullah Khadr irregularly extradited. In this case, however, the American officials wanted Khadr sent to the US for trial and not to Syria for torture. Canadian officials did not, as in the Arar case, send mixed signals about whether they wanted their citizen back and insisted with success that Khadr be returned to Canada.</p>

<p>The Abdullah Khadr case is a reminder of how intelligence-only operations involving harsh interrogation and incommunicado detention can irreparably taint subsequent legal proceedings and how the victims of counter-terrorism abuses can use many different forums to vindicate their rights. What happened in Pakistan did not stay in Pakistan. Indeed, it prevented the criminal prosecution of Abdullah Khadr in the US and may also prevent his criminal prosecution in Canada.</p>

		<title>The Triple Bottom Line: The Need for Greater Corporate Accountability</title>

As concerns over ecological responsibility rise, consumers perceive many corporations as more altruistic through outreach programs and the promotion of green technology. While this perception may be true, some corporations may exaggerate their corporate social responsibility efforts. In order to ensure corporations' commitments to corporate social responsibility, the Congress should create legal obligations, like accounting reformation under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:h.r.03763:">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a>, for these corporations which force their officers to consider the financial impacts of social responsibility and acting green &#8212; a "triple bottom line."</p>

<p>Corporations seek profits for shareholders. Over the course of time, business goals have evolved to include social considerations as well. These new goals have been manifested through changes in the directives guiding many boards of directors. Initially this consideration focused on other members of society. Now it has expanded to include environmental factors. This new triple bottom line has become a growing trend within the business world. Despite a board of director's ability to take these outside factors into account, a corporation's primary function continues to revolve around maximizing profits for shareholders in the company. When more consumers and investors push for corporations to maintain a triple bottom line, then corporations will consider not only their shareholders, but also society and the environment. This new bottom line focuses on the three P's of a twenty-first century business: profit, people and the planet. This dynamic shift in business considerations occurred in part because of the growing interest and expectations that corporations give back to their greater communities. <br />
 <br />
With the aim to maintain and grow their market shares, corporations preserve the hard-won reputations of their brands. As concern over the environmental effects of businesses grows, corporations are gradually pushed into acting as more than profit machines and forced to aim for the triple bottom line. In today's world, if a corporation wants to climb to the top of its industry, it must present itself as environmentally conscious and giving back to the community. Corporations use marketing and targeted displays of community outreach in order to show its socially responsible side. By marketing its image as a company that gives back to the community and invests in green technology, a corporation can bolster the public's belief in its commitment to a triple bottom line regardless of whether the corporation actually tries to reach it. The recent "organic" craze illustrates this concept and provides a parallel view of how marketing effects a consumer's perception. <br />
 <br />
In the late 1990s, consumers began to become concerned about the lasting health effects from consuming genetically altered food and food with chemicals from lingering pesticides. Consumers began to demand "natural" products and grocers began to supply these products on their shelves. Various food producers quickly began advertising their food as all natural, hormone and pesticide free, or locally grown. With all this different terminology, consumers often believed they were getting a less altered and chemically exposed product when compared to other options for the same product. Many companies' chose the correct marketing buzz words but failed to fulfill the consumer's expectation of the product. As consumers became aware of this inconsistent labeling, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created set guidelines for what constituted organic. As a newly certifiable term, organic quickly became recognized as applying only to the upper echelon of natural food products. The creation of this label certification provides consumers with a clearer guide to understanding exactly what they are receiving when they purchase an organic product. Despite this new certification, many products still advertise themselves as all natural or pesticide free. These producers want the image of wholesomeness achieved by their organic competitors without incurring the costs of an organic label. Despite the increased awareness of the FDA organic label, these non-organic, natural foods still sell.<br />
 <br />
The evolution of the organics labeling scheme provides an illustration of some of the issues that have arisen regarding corporate social responsibility and the degree to which companies truly pursue a triple bottom line. In both cases, public interest has pushed companies towards a particular behavior such as organic food or environmentally friendly practices. In response, corporations began shifting their image to reflect the public's desire. Similar to all the different buzz words initially used to describe organic food, corporations continue to attempt to sell themselves to consumers as caring corporations. While some companies are in fact genuine in their commitment to the triple bottom line, the spectrum runs all the way to corporations like Enron and Tyco, which focused solely on increasing profit to the detriment of others through fraudulent accounting practices. Ultimately, the public discovered Enron and Tyco's fraudulent behaviors and Congress responded through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.<br />
 <br />
In 2002, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The act reformed corporations' accounting standards and required that the CFO or CEO sign all the quarterly account statements, seeking to make the heads of corporations personally liable for the accuracy of the signed statements. In order to protect themselves, executive officers heightened standards and increased the scrutiny of company practices. This ultimately created a trickle down effect, leading to entire corporations striving to meet more stringent standards. The implementation of higher standards following the Sarbanes-Oxley Act demonstrates how laws and legal culpability change corporate behavior.<br />
 <br />
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents a legal obligation under the triple bottom line and provides clear insight into the behavior of corporate America. Some corporations will always strive to do as little as possible for anyone but their shareholders; after all, a corporation's primary function is to generate profits. As a result, legislation is necessary to ensure that corporations act beyond their fiscal interests. Further legislative advancement of the triple bottom line can provide more expansive consideration and protection for society, and it will allow for progress to occur in a more widespread fashion. Only when high level officials face personal legal obligations requiring them to fully pursue the triple bottom line, will we begin to see other systematic changes within the corporate framework.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/sociology/people/paul_johnson/index.htm">Paul Johnson</a>, Senior Lecturer of Sociology at the <a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk/">University of Surrey</a>, says that the latest ban by Russian authorities on the promotion of homosexuality to minors is only the most recent violation of the European Court of Human Rights ruling on the subject...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/pauljohnson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n November 16, 2011, the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">overwhelmingly endorsed legislation</a> that proposes to prohibit "public actions aimed at [the] propaganda of pederasty, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors." If passed at a third reading, the law would effectively ban any public expression of homosexuality and outlaw the public association and assembly of sexual minorities. It is proposed that those in breach of the law will be subject to fines ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 rubles (approximately $100 to $1,600). St. Petersburg is the latest region of the Russian Federation to introduce laws ostensibly designed to suppress "gay pride" events. The Ryazan Oblast passed similar legislation in 2006 and this was followed more recently in the Arkhangelsk Oblast where, on November 17, 2011, the Regional Assembly passed a law that prohibits the "promotion of homosexuality among minors." Following the initial success of the legislation in the St. Petersburg Assembly, the Moscow City Duma is reportedly planning to introduce comparable legislation.  </p>

                <p>Whilst many readers in Western European and North American societies will find the development of this legislation both arcane and archaic, it expresses an entrenched hostility in Russia to the types of gay pride events that have become common elsewhere in the world. The legislation that is appearing across the regions of the Russian Federation, and which has the potential to become established in federal law, is anchored in claims that "homosexual propaganda" is a dangerous threat to children and the family. Until recently, similar claims underwrote legislation in the UK that prohibited local authorities from promoting homosexuality and specified that no school could teach that homosexuality was acceptable as a "pretended family relationship" (<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/9/section/28">section 28</a> of the Local Government Act 1988 of England and Wales, repealed by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26/schedule/8/part/1">Local Government Act 2003</a>). Such arguments continue to be used to legitimate a range of anti-gay laws around the world. </p>

                <p>For example, on July 14, 2009, the Lithuanian Parliament amended the <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/319-1.pdf">Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information</a> [PDF] to prohibit any public information "whereby homosexual, bisexual or polygamous relations are promoted" (Article 4.14) and "family relations are distorted, its values are scorned" (Article 4.15). The law was vetoed by the president and amended before its commencement, but the most recent version prohibits any public information "which expresses contempt for family values, encourages the concept of entry into a marriage and creation of a family other than stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania" (Article 4.16). The <a href="http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=245495">Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania</a> defines marriage as "a voluntary agreement between a man and a woman" (Article 3.7).</p>

                <p>The Ryazan Oblast law, which prohibits "Public actions aimed at the promotion of homosexuality (sodomy and lesbianism) among minors," has been upheld by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation. In January 2010, the Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint that the law violated a number of provisions of the Russian Constitution, in particular Article 29 (right to freedom of thought and speech), Article 19 (ban on discrimination) and Article 55 (allowance to limit citizen's constitutional rights only by federal law). The Constitutional Court held that<blockquote>the ban of such propaganda, as purposeful and uncontrolled activity connected to the dissemination of information which can harm the health, morals and spiritual development, including forming of distorted perceptions about social equivalence of traditional and nontraditional marriage relations, among persons, who are deprived, due to their age, of the ability to critically evaluate such information, cannot be considered as breaching the constitutional rights of citizens.</blockquote>What is astonishing about the recent ratcheting up of these regional anti-gay provisions in Russia is that they are in direct defiance of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=echr">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR), which has explicitly admonished Russian public authorities for prohibiting public association and assembly on the grounds of sexual orientation. In <a href="http://strasbourgconsortium.org/document.php?DocumentID=5104">Alekseyev v. Russia</a>, the ECHR upheld a complaint from Alekseyev, a gay rights activist, that the repeated refusals by Moscow authorities for permission to hold a gay pride event violated his rights under Articles 11 (freedom of assembly and association), 13 (effective remedy), and 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

                <p>In respect to Article 11, Alekseyev complained that bans on the public events he had attempted to organize in 2006, 2007 and 2008 had not been in accordance with the law, had not pursued any legitimate aim and had not been necessary in a democratic society. The Russian government claimed that the public authorities had acted lawfully and within their margin of appreciation when deciding to prohibit the events. The government stated that the ban pursued three legitimate aims: the protection of public safety and the prevention of disorder, the protection of morals, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. These aims were legitimate, the government argued, in light of statements made by several religious groups which suggested that the proposed assemblies would cause moral offence and raise significant safety issues. They referred to a number of statements, including those from the Union of Orthodox Citizens which advised the mayor of their intention to conduct a mass protest in response to any Pride march in Moscow; the Orthodox Church which objected to a gay parade on the grounds that it was propaganda promoting sin; the Supreme Mufti for Russia who promised that Muslims and other "normal people" in Russia would demonstrate against any Pride march; and the head of the Muslim authority of Nizhniy Novgorod who argued that "as a matter of necessity, homosexuals must be stoned to death." The ECHR held that "the ban on the events organized by the applicant did not correspond to a pressing social need and was thus not necessary in a democratic society" and unanimously found in favor of Alekseyev. </p>

                <p>In respect to Article 14, Alekseyev complained that, despite the absence of any explicit reference by public authorities to sexual orientation as the grounds for the ban, the main reason for their refusal to grant permission was an official moral disapproval of homosexuality. The basis for the decision, Alekseyev contended, was the mayor of Moscow's disapproval of homosexuality. It had been quoted in the press that the mayor considered that homosexuality was unnatural and that most Moscow residents supported the ban. In light of the antagonistic social relations between homosexuals and religious groups, the government argued that it was not discriminatory, but necessary, for public authorities to place restrictions on the exercise of Article 11 rights. The Court concluded that "the ban imposed on the events organized by the applicant was the authorities' disapproval of demonstrations which they considered to promote homosexuality" and that, as such, "the applicant suffered discrimination on the grounds of his sexual orientation and that of other participants in the proposed events."</p>

                <p>The ECHR judgment in <em>Alekseyev</em> is important for a number of reasons, not least because it explicitly establishes that sexual minorities have a human right to public assembly and association. It gives judicial effect to <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1606669">Recommendation CM/Rec(2010)5</a> of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which states that European nations "should take appropriate measures at national, regional and local levels to ensure that the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Convention, can be effectively enjoyed, without discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity" and, furthermore, that they "should take appropriate measures to prevent restrictions on the effective enjoyment of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly resulting from the abuse of legal or administrative provisions, for example on grounds of public health, public morality and public order." The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe currently have the execution of the judgment in Alekseyev under "enhanced supervision" and it is to be hoped that, given the ongoing blatant defiance of the ECHR decision by the Russian authorities, it will exercise its authority to compel the Russian Federation to remove anti-gay provisions that violate the human rights of homosexuals. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Niccol&#242; Pons, Assistant Legal Officer of the Pre-Trial Chambers of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a>, says that there are many obstacles for the Lebanese court both in obtaining and carrying out a trial <em>in absentia</em>, but that it can still be an effective tool in furthering international justice and accountability...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.org/hotline/niccolopons.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>R</strong></font>ecent developments at the UN-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) have triggered a vivid debate about the fate of the four individuals accused of the terrorist attack that resulted in the assassination of the Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and 22 others on February 14, 2005. The four alleged Hezbollah associates have been at large since June 28, 2011, when the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-files-4-indictments-in-hariri-assasination-investigation.php">counts against them were confirmed</a> by the pre-trial judge and arrests warrants issued accordingly. </p>

                <p>A few weeks ago, the pre-trial judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/lebanon-tribunal-judge-asks-for-trial-in-absentia.php">requested that the Trial Chamber consider</a> whether the conditions to initiate proceedings <em>in absentia</em> have been met. The Chamber <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/the-cases/stl-11-01/main/filings/orders-and-decisions/trial-chamber/f0054">sought observations</a> on the matter from the prosecutor and the defense and scheduled a hearing on November 11, 2011. Counsels have been appointed by the Tribunal to represent the accused. It will now be the responsibility of the trial judges to decide upon an issue which represents a controversial novelty in international criminal law and which could have a significant impact on Lebanese politics.</p>

                <p>Article 22(1) of the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/documents/statute-of-the-tribunal/statute-of-the-special-tribunal-for-lebanon">STL Statute</a> provides for trials <em>in absentia</em> in three distinct situations, namely when the accused (i) has expressly and in writing waived his right to be present; (ii) has not been handed over to the Tribunal by the State authorities concerned; or (iii) has absconded or otherwise cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his appearance before the Tribunal and to inform him of the charges. </p>

                <p>According to Article 22(2) of the statute, before conducting proceedings in the absence of the defendants, two conditions must be fulfilled. First, the accused must be notified or served with the indictment or, alternatively, he must be given notice thereof through publication in the media or communication to the state of residence or nationality. Second, the accused shall be afforded with a counsel of his own choice or with a court-appointed counsel. </p>

                <p>In addition, Rule 106(B) of the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/documents/rules-of-procedure-and-evidence/rules-of-procedure-and-evidence">Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> stipulates that, in case the accused is not present on account of the failure or refusal of the relevant state to hand him over, before deciding to conduct proceedings <em>in absentia</em> the Trial Chamber shall, in addition to assessing whether the requirements under Article 22(2) of the statute are met, consult with the Tribunal's president and establish that all necessary steps have been taken with a view to ensuring that the accused may participate in the proceedings.</p>

                <p>As difficult as it may be, a fairly comprehensive way to define proceedings <em>in absentia</em> is to refer to them as a residual and exceptional institution to be relied on only when all the reasonable steps to secure the presence of the accused fail and there are insurmountable obstacles in obtaining his custody.</p>

                <p>Essentially, proceedings in absentia constitute a fragile compromise between two conflicting instances: the right of the accused to be tried in his presence and to defend himself in person, on the one hand, and the need not to subjugate the judicial system to the failure or refusal of the accused to be present at trial on the other. The right of the accused to be present at trial is a fundamental safeguard to the principle of fairness of criminal proceedings and is enshrined in Article 14(3)(d) of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> as well as in all major regional human rights conventions. When derogating from such a crucial right, proceedings <em>in absentia</em> are supposed to be compensated by the possibility, for an absentee arrested or surrendering in the course or after the conclusion of the <em>in absentia</em> trial, to request the termination of the current proceedings and initiate a new trial in his presence. The right to retrial is provided in Article 22(3) of the STL Statute and in Rules 108 and 109. Importantly, all other rights accorded to an absentee defendant and the procedure governing the <em>in absentia</em> trial are exactly the same as if the accused were physically present before the bench.</p>

                <p>For the time being, it is only possible to make some speculations on the scenarios which are likely to materialize in the forthcoming weeks, based on the little publicly available information. In his submissions to the Trial Chamber, the prosecutor argued about the inappropriateness, at this stage, of commencing proceedings <em>in absentia</em> against the four accused. His observations reveal that there exist two different situations to date. </p>

                <p>In an <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2089422,00.html">interview</a> with TIME Magazine dated August 18, 2011, one of the four men at large allegedly declared that his whereabouts are known to the Lebanese authorities and that "if they wanted to arrest me they would have done it a long time ago." Reading the article, one can readily understand that the accused is well aware of the accusations against him, and that therefore he received notice of the indictment, as required by the STL Statute, although he was not personally served thereof. </p>

                <p>Should all this information be reliable, however, such scenario could constitute a failure or refusal by Lebanon to comply with a Tribunal's request or order under Rule 20(C). Accordingly, the president of the STL would probably engage in consultations with the competent Lebanese authorities and, if the arrest warrant would still remain unexecuted, he would be likely to make a judicial finding of non-cooperation and refer the matter to the UN Security Council for consideration and further action against Lebanon, if appropriate, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>. This would significantly delay the Trial Chamber's determination, upon consultation with the STL president, that "all necessary steps have been taken with a view to ensuring that the accused may ... participate in the proceedings" and thus begin proceedings <em>in absentia</em>, as required by Rule 106(B).</p>

                <p>The second scenario relates to the other three accused in the Hariri case. Let us assume that they have "absconded or otherwise cannot be found." This is the situation envisaged by Article 22(1)(c) of the statute and Rule 106(A)(iii). In addition, no or little information could be available about their location and, more importantly, on whether or not they have been informed about the charges against them. Under these circumstances, how can the Chamber be satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to inform the accused of the charges against them if it is not clear whether the fugitives have been personally served with the indictment or had otherwise knowledge thereof by way of any other channels of communication? </p>

                <p>It should be borne in mind that human rights jurisprudence, although not unanimously, seems to require that, in principle, trials <em>in absentia</em> may commence only when the accused has clearly and unequivocally waived his right to attend the hearings, thus giving the consent for the trial to be conducted in his absence. However, in fugitive scenarios such as the one concerning three of the four Hezbollah members, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has stated in <em>Kuonov v. Bulgaria</em> that even in the absence of personal notification of the indictment, it can still be unequivocally demonstrated on the basis of certain factual information; that the indicted is fully aware of the nature and cause of the accusations against him and that he does not have the intention to be present at trial or that he is trying to evade prosecution.  </p>

                <p>At this point, the Trial Chamber would have a choice to make. On the one hand, the judges could decide that, pending the referral to the UN Security Council of the matter related to Lebanon's non-cooperation in apprehending the first accused, the entire proceedings against the four defendants will be delayed. On the other hand, the possibility of severing the case could be considered. The proceedings against the three fugitives, whose whereabouts could remain unknown if there was enough information to demonstrate that they have waived their right to be present, would proceed in their absence. To the contrary, the case against the first accused would be delayed until the Chamber has enough information to be satisfied that all reasonable steps had been taken to ensure the presence of the indicted before the STL.</p>

                <p>In addition to giving legal characterization to the factual combinations that will arise from the evidence concerning the four accused in the Hariri case, the STL will have to bear a much more challenging and sensitive burden. The victims of terrorism and Lebanese people more generally are waiting for answers and have great expectations. The STL will have to meet these expectations and demonstrate that proceedings <em>in absentia</em>, should they really take place, do not represent a failure of the judicial system or a shortcoming to the establishment of truth, but one of the legitimate resources provided by international law on which the Tribunal can rely to honor its mandate and hold a fair and impartial trial.</p>

She compares the recently abandoned CLASS Act to France's long-term health care system, arguing that the act's failure was a missed opportunity to explore the impact of this long-term home care scheme...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/annschunicht.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>I</strong></font>n October 2011, the Obama administration abandoned a piece of the <a href="/feature/2011/06/health-care-reform.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) because US health officials could not create a voluntary, budget-neutral program under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1721:">Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act</a> (CLASS Act). Beginning in October 2012, the CLASS Act would have provided funds to disabled and elderly citizens for long-term home care. These funds would not have replaced basic health insurance, long-term care coverage from Medicaid or other forms of private insurance; rather it would have supplemented existing insurance and paid for independent living expenses.</p>

<p>The CLASS Act provided that enrollees would participate on a voluntary basis in a fund that would function as a national insurance program. Working adults would have made voluntary premium contributions, paid directly to the fund, or deductions would have been taken from their paychecks. In order to receive benefits, the policyholder would have had to pay monthly premiums for at least five years and have been employed during three of those five years. Further, in order to receive benefits, the individual would have had to have suffered from multiple functional limitations or cognitive impairments. The impairment must have been expected to last for a continuous period of more than 90 days.</p>

<p>Premiums paid by enrollees and interest earned on the fund balance would have subsidized the CLASS Act fund. The premium rates would have varied; for example, younger enrollees would have paid less than older enrollees. In addition, individuals with income below the federal poverty level and employed full-time students would have paid lower premiums. The funds could have been used for home health care, adult day care, assistive technology, home modifications, personal assistance services, respite care, accessible transportation and homemaker services.    </p>

<p>The CLASS Act was a hard political sell from the beginning. Projections showed a low enrollment rate, especially from the healthy population, and future costs outweighed future income. Originally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that in the first decade, the CLASS Act would reduce the federal deficit by $70 billion. The CBO also projected a reduction in Medicaid spending over a decade because fewer individuals would enter institutional living and would qualify for Medicaid. Despite the benefits, the CBO found that the CLASS Act would lose money after 10 to 20 years, when the costs of the benefits would have begun to exceed the premiums.  </p>

<p>With the CLASS Act removed from the PPACA, Americans must solve the problem of how to finance elder and end-of-life care. The passage of the CLASS Act would have created a voluntary and public national insurance program that would have helped to alleviate the high cost of long-term care. It is estimated that two-thirds of Americans will need some type of long-term care later in life. Despite this high proportion of Americans, only half of current retirees have saved over $55,000 for long-term care. Additionally, only seven million Americans own long-term-care insurance policies.    </p>

<p>Policies similar to the CLASS Act do exist in other countries, and they help aging populations to pay for long-term care. In 2002, France adopted a system called the <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005631242&dateTexte=vig">Allocation Personnalis&#233;e d'Autonomie</a> (APA), a long-term care insurance system funded by the general tax and administered at a regional level. The French government determines the enrollees of the insurance program based on income, and enrollees with lower incomes receive more benefits. On the other hand, individuals with higher incomes and lower public long-term care benefits, purchase private long-term care insurance to supplement their government benefits. France's public health insurance system provides its enrollees with health care in institutions and at home.    </p>

<p>The CLASS Act and the APA have similarities and differences. In France, the APA provides funds for people 60 years of age and over, whereas the CLASS Act does not have an age requirement. Instead, CLASS Act enrollees would have been eligible after making five years of premium payments into the system. Like the CLASS Act, the APA does not provide benefits unless the patient has suffered a loss of autonomy, which is to say that an individual needs help with at least three daily living activities. The CLASS Act limited eligibility to individuals unable to perform two or more activities of daily living, or to those with a cognitive disability that required supervision or assistance in performing these activities. Similar to the CLASS Act, the APA allows beneficiaries to spend the monthly cash allowance on a variety of long-term care purposes, including hiring caregivers, paying family members to function as caregivers or even renovating homes in order to improve mobility.  </p>

<p>The enactment of the CLASS Act would have moved the US towards a public, national insurance plan focused on alleviating the cost of long-term care. The system would have functioned very similarly to France's APA, providing a monthly credit for any necessary form of long-term care. If the CLASS Act had followed in the footsteps of France's APA, it may have cost more than anticipated. The expected first year cost of the APA was $3.6 billion, but actual costs totaled $4.9 billion. With current low private enrollment rates in long-term care policies in the US, enrollment rates in the CLASS Act may have remained low or individuals may have taken advantage of the credit system and begun to pay the monthly premiums. It is difficult to say.  <br />
	<br />
However, without the CLASS Act, the US remains with its current method of long-term care, which includes government-managed, long-term care insurance through tax incentives and increased Medicaid coverage. The PPACA is a significant piece of health care reform legislation that will benefit the nation, and Americans will never know if the CLASS Act would have continued this trend.   </p>

The ECCC is a UN-assisted court located in Cambodia and established pursuant to the <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/Docs/Court%20Documents/Agreement_between_UN_and_RGC.pdf">Agreement between the Cambodian government and the UN</a> [PDF], signed in 2003. Several major NGOs, the executive director of the International Bar Association, and individual commentators have addressed this issue in recent months, calling for measures to be taken. <br />
                <br />
                On October 5, 2011, the <em>Cambodia Daily</em> newspaper reported Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong as saying that only Cambodia can decide how many additional suspects the Khmer Rouge tribunal will prosecute. This statement echoed similar remarks made by other high-level Cambodian government officials, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, which were reported in the local press. The foreign minister's remarks came at a critical time with Cases 003 and 004 before the ECCC.<br />
                <br />
                Such remarks evince a clear and blatant disregard for the concept of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, as well as a gravely erroneous assumption that the Cambodian government must be able to dictate the outcome of a legal process. Developments in Case 003 have unfortunately only reinforced this view. Commenting on the long-standing and deep-seated problems in the Cambodian judiciary, UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Cambodia, Surya Subedi, emphasized on October 23, 2011, that "the independence of the judiciary needs to be anchored in fundamental laws on the judiciary, which have been awaiting adoption since 1993."<br />
                <br />
                A principled approach must be taken with regard to the manifold problems at the ECCC and the rule of law must be upheld. If an institution responsible for adjudicating allegations of the most serious crimes &#8212;  serious violations of international humanitarian law &#8212; is subject without doubt to governmental interference, fair trial rights cannot be guaranteed in its proceedings, and any decision in any case which has political implications for the ruling government will likely be subject to political interference.<br />
                <br />
                Where such interference manifests itself in judicial decisions which lack legal basis and appear to be written to force particular outcomes, and which, as in three recent opinions of the ECCC's Pre-Trial Chamber in Case 003, consistently demonstrate a split between the national judges (who constitute a majority in every judicial chamber, in line with the Agreement) and the international judges, dangerous and undesirable legal precedents are set in the still-developing field of international criminal law. In their dissenting opinions in these recent decisions &#8212; rendered on October 24, 2011, November 2, 2011, and November 15, 2011, respectively &#8212; the international judges meticulously set out what they consider to be numerous irregularities and legal errors in the work of Co-Investigating Judges Siegfried Blunk and You Bunleng in Case 003. Judge Blunk recently resigned from the court.<br />
                <br />
                Tellingly, in another decision rendered on September 9, 2010, concerning a defense appeal related to requests to summon six high-level officials as witnesses in Case 002, the Pre-Trial Chamber split again on national and international lines. The minority international judges held that "no reasonable trier of fact could have failed to consider that the above-mentioned facts and their sequence constitute a reason to believe that one or more members of the [Cambodian Government] may have knowingly and willfully interfered with witnesses who may give evidence before the [Co-Investigating Judges]." The dissenting international judges concluded with an appeal, stating that it was imperative that the Pre-Trial Chamber "do its utmost to ensure that the charged persons are provided with a fair trial." Further, pursuant to the court's internal rules, if a supermajority decision by the second instance chamber (such as the Pre-Trial Chamber) cannot be reached, the decision rendered in the first instance stands, thereby depriving the parties of the right to a decision on appeal.<br />
                <br />
                Such a situation is detrimental to the truth-finding process and to the determination of the precise boundaries of individual criminal responsibility &#8212; a complex process in and of itself &#8212; and undermines the rights of the accused in Case 002 and the suspects in Cases 003 and 004.<br />
                <br />
                While independent and impartial investigations into political interference and judicial misconduct at the ECCC should be conducted immediately, the UN should also start exploring other solutions for the court without delay. It should, for example, consider revisiting the terms of the Agreement. Or it should consider the withdrawal of cooperation and ceasing to provide assistance to the court pursuant to the provisions of Article 28 of the Agreement.<br />
                <br />
                This issue also has important implications for the work of other courts in the international criminal justice system and is therefore not isolated to the future of the ECCC. It must be resolved in full accordance with the rule of law and principles set out in the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>, rather than with an adherence to the current framework whose negative legacy is only too painfully obvious to see.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.queensu.ca/facultyAndStaff/facultyDirectory/bala.html">Nicholas Bala</a> of Queen's University Faculty of Law says the recent ruling in British Columbia holding that Canada's criminal prohibition of polygamy is constitutionally justified despite violating the guarantee of freedom of religion is strong and should prevent the spread of polygamy in Canada...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/nicholasbala.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he recent ruling of Chief Justice Robert Bauman of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in the <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/SC/11/15/2011BCSC1588.htm">Polygamy Reference</a> offers the world's most comprehensive judicial treatment to date of the legal status of polygamy. Bauman concluded that Canada's criminal prohibition on polygamy is a violation of the guarantee of freedom of religion in the Canadian <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, but accepted that this is constitutionally justified as a reasonable limitation intended to prevent harm to women, children and society. This is a welcome ruling that, if upheld, should prevent the spread of polygamy in Canada. The decision is significant not only with regard to polygamy, but also for the way that it addresses issues related to the scope of religious freedom and the definition of familial relationships, most notably same-sex marriage. A major bonus for scholars interested in polygamy is that all the extensive expert reports, articles and affidavits filed in the case, as well as significant portions of the transcripts, have been <a href="http://polyadvocacy.ca/">made available online</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Canada's Evolving Definition of the Family</strong></p>

<p>Over the past half century, Canadian courts and legislatures have developed a broad and functional approach to the recognition of familial relationships. Canada gives significant legal rights and responsibilities to an adult who has established a parent-like relationship with a child, most typically the partner of a biological parent. Canada was also one of the first countries to grant a wide range of rights and obligations to unmarried opposite-sex cohabitants. </p>

<p>More recently and most contentiously, Canada was one of the first countries to recognize same-sex marriage. This process involved a number of appellate decisions, such as the 2003 Court of Appeal for Ontario judgment in <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/decisions/2003/june/halpernC39172.htm">Halpern v. Canada</a>, which held that it was a discriminatory violation of the Charter to fail to allow two persons of the same sex to marry each other. Crucial to these rulings was judicial acceptance of the fact that children are not harmed by being raised by same-sex partners and the conclusion that recognizing same-sex marriage would promote the interests of children being raised in these relationships. Recognizing same-sex relationships did not have societal costs, but on the contrary led to social savings, as individuals in these relationships can look to their partners rather than the state for support. This litigation resulted in Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-canada-passes-same-sex.php">enacting</a> the <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2005-c-33/latest/sc-2005-c-33.html">Civil Marriage Act</a>, defining lawful marriage as the "lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others." Although politically controversial, public opinion polls at the time showed that a clear majority of Canadians supported the enactment of this legislation, revealing public acceptance that recognition of same-sex marriage was needed to ensure equality for homosexuals.</p>

<p><strong>Polygamy in Canada and the Reference Case</strong></p>

<p>Since 1890, Canada's criminal law has prohibited polygamous marriage or living in a "polygamous union," and immigration laws prohibit settlement in Canada of polygamous families. Despite these laws, about 1,000 polygamous fundamentalist Mormons live in the area of Bountiful, British Columbia. There are also a small number of polygamous families who have immigrated to Canada from countries in Asia and Africa where the practice is legal, misrepresenting their familial relationships in order to enter the country. Additionally, a small number of Muslims have had polygamous religious ceremonies performed by Islamic imams in Canada.   </p>

<p>Over the years there were reports from Bountiful of the coerced polygamous marriage of women, including adolescents trafficked into Canada from fundamentalist Mormon communities in the US for this purpose. There were, however, no prosecutions for polygamy in Canada in over 70 years, partly because of difficulty in obtaining evidence about practices in the isolated, secretive community of Bountiful and, more recently, due to questions about the constitutionality of the law in light of the introduction of the Charter of Rights in 1982.  </p>

<p>Around the time that same-sex marriage was introduced in Canada in 2005, there was a split in the Bountiful community, with one group beginning to seek media attention and advocate for the legal recognition of polygamy, adopting some of the rhetoric of gay activists about the need for respect for the choice of their "lifestyle," as well as making arguments based on religious freedom. In the face of growing media attention and public concern, and in response to complaints from women who had fled polygamous marriages, polygamy charges were laid against the two most prominent men in Bountiful in 2008, each of whom was alleged to have multiple wives. These charges were <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/SC/09/12/2009BCSC1299.htm">dismissed</a> on procedural grounds.  Although polygamy charges could have been brought again, the British Columbia government decided to refer the questions of the constitutionality and proper interpretation of the polygamy law to the province's Supreme Court, the highest level of trial court. The reference process in Canada allows governments to seek the opinions of the courts about legal issues; although technically only advisory, these opinions are regarded as highly persuasive.</p>

<p>The reference process stretched over two years, with the governments of Canada and British Columbia defending the law's constitutionality and a court-appointed <em>amicus curiae</em> challenging it. There were 17 intervenors representing a range of religious, civil liberties and advocacy groups, as well as one of the men previously charged.  Much of the evidence was submitted by way of affidavits and written expert reports. In hearings held over four months, a few of the experts were cross-examined, and testimony and video-recorded statements were received by court from present and former members of the Bountiful community about their experiences with polygamy, with these community members remaining anonymous.     </p>

<p>Bauman's 300-plus-page ruling extensively reviews the evidence and submissions about the history and nature of marriage, both monogamous and polygamous, as well as jurisprudence from a number of countries and international law. While the expert witnesses and community members were not unanimous, the weight of evidence clearly supported the view that polygamy, or more accurately polygyny (one man having two or more wives), results in physical and psychological harm to women and is inherently unequal. There are some women who voluntarily choose to enter polygamous marriages and are satisfied in these relationships. However, many women enter in polygamous marriages only due to coercion, but once married, feel great pressure to stay with the father of their children. Women in polygamous marriages often suffer from competition with their "sister wives," and compared to women in monogamous marriages, suffer from relatively high rates of abuse, depression and poverty.</p>

<p>Further, research from many countries establishes that polygamy endangers children, both female and male. A significant portion of Bauman's judgment addresses the negative effects of polygyny on children and society. Beyond the abuse and exploitation of adolescent females, polygamy inevitably results in the expulsion of many of adolescent and young adult males from their families and community &#8212; the "lost boys" of Bountiful and fundamentalist Mormon communities in the US. There are widespread negative economic and social effects to polygyny in societies where the practice is common.  </p>

<p>The court accepted that the prohibition on polygamy is a restriction on freedom of religion, which is protected under &#167; 2(a) of the Charter, in particular the religious freedom of fundamentalist Mormons, many of which believe that polygyny is divinely sanctioned, and of Muslims, many of whom regard it as a religiously acceptable form of marriage. Bauman, however, concluded that the law is constitutionally valid, invoking &#167; 1 of the Charter, which allows courts to uphold laws which restrict constitutional rights if the state satisfies the onus of establishing that the law is "demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."    </p>

<p>In applying the &#167; 1 test, Bauman concluded that "the salutary effects of the prohibition far outweigh the deleterious." He further observed: "The law seeks to advance the institution of monogamous marriage, a fundamental value in Western society from the earliest of times. It seeks to protect against the many harms which are reasonably apprehended to arise out of the practice of polygamy." This decision is one of a number of recent Canadian cases where courts have struggled with the scope of freedom of religion. Bauman's decision in the <em>Polygamy Reference</em> relied heavily on the 2009 Supreme Court of Canada judgment in <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/2009/2009scc37/2009scc37.html">Hutterian Brethren</a>, which emphasized that freedom of religion is not absolute. In that case, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote that "the real issue is whether the impact of the rights infringement is disproportionate to the likely benefits of the impugned law."  </p>

<p>In his decision, Bauman also considered the validity of the polygamy prohibition in the context of Canada's recognition of same-sex marriage. He rejected the "alarmist view ... that recognition of the legitimacy of same-sex marriage will lead to the legitimization of polygamy," noting that polygamy is a practice "inevitably associated with serious harms." While recognition of same-sex marriage promotes equality, polygyny promotes inequality.</p>

<p>Although upholding the validity of the law, Bauman concluded that it is not constitutionally permissible to prosecute a person (inevitably a woman) who entered a polygamous marriage while a minor. He also held that the criminal prohibition applies only to those who go through some form of polygamous ceremony or undertake a marital commitment, precluding the prosecution of polyamorists who chose to live together in intimate adult relationships of three of more but without formal marital commitments.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary and Future Developments</strong></p>

<p>Although widely praised by editorialists and politicians as reflective of Canadian values and consistent with the views of the vast majority of Canadians, the decision in the <em>Polygamy Reference</em> has been criticized by some academic commentators and a few columnists as disregarding religious freedom and inappropriately valorizing monogamy. Some commentators argue that respect for multiculturalism requires allowing immigration by polygamist families from countries where this practice is legal. However, it is notable that a number of Western European countries which had open immigration policies for polygamist families for a period of time changed these policies after it became clear that there are serious social problems associated with this family structure. These countries are now struggling to deal with the problems of significant polygamous populations while preventing more of this type of immigration. Canada's criminal prohibition on polygamy is an important anchor for the restrictions on immigration by polygamous families.    </p>

<p>Bauman's decision is highly likely to be appealed, and the issue of the constitutionality and interpretation of the polygamy law is likely to be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. Until the legal issues are resolved, there will be an understandable reluctance to commence prosecutions. If the law is upheld, there should be prosecutions, albeit selective ones. Polygamy is not a "victimless crime." Evidence in the <em>Polygamy Reference</em> revealed that there are fundamentalist Mormon men in Canada who coerced younger women and adolescent females into polygamous marriages, and prosecutions are especially warranted in such cases. There is, however, also a critical need for culturally sensitive services to support women, children and young men who want to leave polygamous families and communities. Further, the family courts should afford women leaving these relationships the same relief as would be afforded an unmarried cohabitant, such as child support and property remedies based on constructive trust.</p>

<p><em>Nicholas Bala is a Professor of Law at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He is one of Canada's leading scholars of family and children's law, and he submitted an expert witness report in the <em>Polygamy Reference</em> on behalf of one of the intervenors, <a href="http://stoppolygamyincanada.wordpress.com/">Stop Polygamy in Canada</a>. In it, he provided an extensive review of literature and law on polygamy, and argued in favor of the constitutional validity of the present law.</em></p>

She writes on the need for a revised opinion in the <em>Yves Saint Laurent v. Louboutin</em> case that would allow for the future protection of certain single color marks in the fashion industry...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/daniellegorman.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>I</strong></font>ntegral to the success of French footwear designer Christian Louboutin is his instantly recognizable, source-identifying mark: the red outsole. The Red Sole Mark received federal trademark registration in 2008, affording protection to "a lacquered red sole on footwear." Despite this preemptively valid registration and the overwhelming association in consumers' minds between the red sole and the Louboutin brand, the Red Sole Mark could lose its federal protection if the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upholds a decision of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court acknowledged that color alone may sometimes be protected as a trademark &#8212; a premise set forth by the Supreme Court in 1995 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17905304466595211702">Qualitex v. Jacobson</a> &#8212; but its analysis of the protectability of a single color trademark was complicated by the fact that the color mark was applied to an article in the fashion industry, where "color serves ornamental and aesthetic functions vital to robust competition."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2013261766487275555">Louboutin v. Yves Saint Laurent</a> decision has led other designers, such as <em>amicus curiae</em> Tiffany &amp; Co., to conclude that single color marks in fashion will never be allowed federal trademark protection. This per se bar on single color marks in fashion is problematic because it is based on a generalized analysis of the fashion industry as a whole and could erode trademark protection within fashion beyond just single color marks. Using the district court's rationale, many currently enforceable multi-color marks in fashion, such as the Burberry check, could be canceled under similarly broad constructions of functionality, aesthetic functionality and color depletion theory. As a result, the fashion industry could experience an uncertain or dwindling amount of protection. Moreover, the effects of <em>Louboutin</em> could ripple into other industries. <em>Amicus curiae</em> International Trademark Association fears that "[r]ights granted as a result of the careful examination process of the Federal trademark registration system could be upended arbitrarily" if courts construe the mark holder's mark to be broader than it actually is rather than relying on the specific language and construction of each trademark's registration.</p>

<p>The Second Circuit should vacate and remand the district court's opinion. The district court's erroneous characterization of Louboutin's registration as a "claim 'to the color red'" rather than a claim for "a lacquered red sole on footwear" and its broad construal of the doctrine of aesthetic functionality establish a poor precedent for analyzing the protectability of single color trademarks. Rather than invoking generalizations and criticized theories in order to forego a more specific competitive necessity analysis, courts should make an individual, holistic examination of the trademark in question on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>By characterizing Louboutin's claim as a claim to the color red, the district court advanced the color depletion theory. Color depletion theory reflects the concern that the number of colors available for appropriation is limited and granting exclusive rights in any color would thus be anticompetitive. However, in ruling that single colors can serve as trademarks, the court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11057387992216597660">In re Owens-Corning</a> acknowledged that "following passage of the Lanham Act courts have declined to perpetuate [the color depletion theory's] per se prohibition which is in conflict with the liberating purposes of the Act," and agreed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that "the color depletion argument is an unreasonable restriction on the acquisition of trademark rights." The Supreme Court adopted this position in <em>Qualitex</em>, holding that the color depletion argument is unpersuasive "largely because it relies on an occasional problem to justify a blanket prohibition."  </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the district court invoked this theory in order to deem the Red Sole Mark a "monopoly on the color red." Though the court posits "Louboutin would thus be able to market a total outfit in his red, while other designers would not," Louboutin's trademark registration specifically limits the red mark to footwear and includes a line drawing to show placement of the mark on the outsole of a shoe. Moreover, the court neglected the specific facts of the case in favor of applying the color depletion theory at the outset. <em>Owens-Corning</em> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8066256153461634216">Master Distributors, Inc. v. Pako Corporation</a> provide that each case is to be decided on its facts and where a party has met all the normal trademark requirements, the color depletion theory should not bar the party's single color mark from protection. </p>

<p>In general, the color depletion theory fails to take into account the specific properties of color &#8212; including hue, saturation and value &#8212; and therefore underestimates the thousands, if not millions, of different colors distinguishable to the human eye. Descriptive word marks address these scarcity issues by requiring secondary meaning for protection. This compromise is also appropriate for assessing color trademarks. Where color, such as Louboutin's red, has acquired secondary meaning, the threat of depletion should be allayed. The invocation of color depletion theory in <em>Louboutin</em> diverges from the modern trajectory set in place by <em>Owens-Corning</em> and <em>Qualitex</em> and sets a defective precedent for the review of other single color marks in fashion.<br />
  <br />
The district court also erred in its broad construal of aesthetic functionality. Aesthetic functionality is based on the premise that the visual appeal of a trademark may be essential to effective competition or an important ingredient in the commercial success of the product, and must, therefore, be free for all to imitate. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5908618221163465935">Pagliero v. Wallace China Co.</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied the aesthetic functionality doctrine and found that the defendant was entitled to copy the plaintiff's china designs, since the attractiveness of the design was the primary selling feature of the china and thereby served a non-trademark function. However, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the <em>Pagliero</em> test for aesthetic functionality in deciding the nearly identical case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11518243566326954589">Villeroy &amp; Boch Keramische Werke v. THC Systems</a>. In <em>Qualitex</em>, the Supreme Court adopted the Restatement standard, which limits aesthetic functionality to situations where the design "confers a significant benefit that cannot practically be duplicated by the use of alternative designs." The use of the aesthetic functionality doctrine for source-identifying marks currently varies by circuit, though most courts have rejected or limited its application.</p>

<p>However, in <em>Louboutin</em> the court reverted to a broad construal of aesthetic functionality, finding that in fashion color is used primarily to advance expressive, ornamental and aesthetic purposes. Rather than examining the availability of alternative designs, the court automatically found a threat to competition based on the premise that color is part of the consumer appeal of fashion items. The question should not have been whether fashion designers in general need to use the color red, but rather whether footwear designers need to use red outsoles in order to compete effectively in their market. The generalized construal of aesthetic functionality in <em>Louboutin</em> could render nearly every mark in fashion unprotectable, with the presumption that a visually appealing mark is necessary for free competition since fashion is premised on aesthetic beauty. The Ninth Circuit recognized the implications of such a standard in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2319178796125869349">Vuitton et Fils S.A. v. J. Young Enterprises</a>, where it rejected the contention that Louis Vuitton's mark was aesthetically functional merely because it appealed to consumers.</p>

<p>Scholars have long argued against such a broad interpretation of aesthetic functionality. Thomas McCarthy, author of the leading treatise on trademark law, contends that "[t]he notion of 'aesthetic functionality' is an unwarranted and illogical expansion of the functionality policy, carrying it far outside the utilitarian rationale that created the policy." Others note that it is contradictory to deny trademark protection to marks on the basis of their consumer appeal and demand, since creation of this demand is a recognized trademark function. Many are wary of the doctrine simply because there is no clear standard or unity among the courts. </p>

<p>In considering Yves Saint Laurent's counterclaim on remand, the district court should consider Louboutin's trademark in the context of its 2008 registration, and specifically ask whether Louboutin's lacquered red outsoles are a competitive necessity. Single color marks in fashion, where those marks meet all other trademark requirements, merit protection because the ability to register such marks would fit well within the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_22.html">Lanham Act</a> and fortify the fashion industry's current shortage of intellectual property protections. The court will probably find no likelihood of confusion between Louboutin's shoes and the Yves Saint Laurent heels that prompted this infringement suit, and thus no likelihood of success on the merits to warrant a preliminary injunction for Louboutin. However, the opinion of the district court must be revised in order to allow for the possibility of protecting distinctive and non-functional single color marks in fashion in the future.</p>

Brown</em>, and the loss does not bode well for them <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-consolidates-proposition-8-challenge-with-claim-that-judge-was-biased.php">going into the next hearing</a> before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday.<br />
                <br />
                On November 17, the California Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, agreed with the official proponents of <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [PDF] and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/california-high-court-rules-proposition-8-sponsors-may-defend-it-in-court.php">issued a decision</a> which clearly supports their right to defend the amendment on appeal in the Ninth Circuit. The court flatly rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that the amendment should go undefended simply because the California attorney general and the governor refused to defend it.<br />
                <br />
                The court embraced a long-standing practice allowing official proponents of initiatives to defend those initiatives in court when they are challenged. The court explained that the initiative right is "one of the most precious rights of our democratic process" and that it is the duty of the courts to "jealously guard this right of the people." Consequently, the court held that "[n]either the Governor, the Attorney General, nor any other executive or legislative official has the authority to veto or invalidate an initiative measure that has been approved by the voters." That is exactly what would have happened if the plaintiffs had their way.<br />
                <br />
                This is the third time that their position on the law has been flatly rejected by an appellate court. The first time was prior to the <em>Perry</em> trial when the plaintiffs' counsel sought documents related to the internal communications of Proposition 8's proponents &#8212; documents which are clearly protected under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a>. Unsurprisingly, then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker of the US District Court for the Northern District of California permitted them to seek these documents. Proposition 8's proponents were forced to seek an immediate ruling from the Ninth Circuit, which issued a scathing decision <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-denies-disclosure-of.php">rejecting the plaintiffs' arguments</a> and reversing Judge Walker's ruling. Then the plaintiffs supported the unlawful videotaping and transmission of the trial, despite the fact that the court's rules prohibited the broadcast of federal trials. Again, Proposition 8's proponents were forced to appeal. This time the issue went all the way to the Supreme Court, which issued an order on the first day of trial <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-blocks-youtube-broadcast.php">halting the taping and planned broadcast</a>. After Judge Walker issued his unprecedented decision <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">striking down the California marriage amendment</a>, its proponents sought to stay the decision pending appeal. Of course, the plaintiffs objected, and Judge Walker <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-to-lift-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">denied the request</a>, only to have the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-extends-stay-on-california-same-sex-marriage.php">grant it days later</a>.<br />
                <br />
                The plaintiffs have been on the wrong side of established law from the beginning of this case. They were wrong on the scope of the First Amendment during pre-trial discovery, they were wrong on the lawfulness of broadcasting the federal trial, they were wrong on whether a stay of Judge Walker's decision was appropriate, and they were wrong about whether the proponents of Proposition 8 had standing to appeal and defend it. So why would anyone think that the plaintiffs are right about the amendment's constitutionality? Every appellate court to have considered claims identical to theirs has rejected those claims &#8212; including the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court.<br />
                <br />
                The plaintiffs insist that they have a fundamental right marry someone of the same sex, knowing full well that the Supreme Court has held repeatedly that a fundamental right is one that is "objectively and deeply rooted in our nation's history and traditions," and that every time the Supreme Court has articulated the fundamental right to marry, it has been in the context of a man and a woman. They also take the extreme position that there is no legitimate reason whatsoever for marriage to have existed for millennia as the union of a man and a woman. Not only that, they insist that anyone who believes otherwise is irrational &#8212; "anyone" includes dozens of judges, hundreds of legislators, and millions of Americans who have voted to preserve marriage.<br />
                <br />
                Clearly, the only thing that is irrational is to make such an argument. Those who are pursuing so-called "marriage equality" would do well to better respect those who believe in "marriage integrity."</p>

This groundbreaking public health legislation requires that all tobacco products sold in Australia as of December 1, 2011, be in plain packages with no industry logos, promotional texts, brand imagery or colors. It also requires that all cigarettes be sold in drab, olive green packages and include expanded graphic health warnings covering 75 percent of the front of the pack and 90 percent of the back. Upon the legislation's passage, the Australian Minister of Health and Ageing stated, "[t]oday, one of the most momentous public health measures in Australia's history has been delivered by the Australian Parliament &#8212; legislation requiring the plain packaging of tobacco products."<br />
 <br />
Although applauded by the public health community in Australia, the plain packaging legislation was greeted by swift and much anticipated legal action by tobacco giant Philip Morris which had long threatened legal proceedings if the plain packaging legislation was adopted. On the same day the legislation was promulgated by the Australian Parliament, Philip Morris Ltd. <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">initiated legal proceedings</a> against the Australian government on behalf of its Australian subsidiary to block the legislation from coming into effect. In addition, just one hour after the legislation was adopted, Philip Morris Asia Ltd. (PMA), a Hong Kong-based company, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">served</a> a notice of arbitration under Hong Kong's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Australia.<br />
 <br />
The World Health Organization (WHO) has long called upon countries to ban advertising and promotion of tobacco products to stem the growth of the world tobacco epidemic, which now kills an estimated six million persons per year. Pursuant to the 2003 <a href="http://www.who.int/fctc/en/">WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</a> (FCTC), the first treaty adopted under WHO auspices, states party to the Convention are called upon to "undertake a comprehensive ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship." The Convention defines promotion and sponsorship as "any form of commercial communication, recommendation or action with the aim, effect or likely effect of promoting a tobacco product or tobacco use either directly or indirectly." With 174 state parties, the FCTC is one of the most widely subscribed to treaties in history and as more states have moved to fulfill their legal commitments under the FCTC to ban tobacco advertising and promotion, the tobacco package is taking on ever more importance as a mechanism to promote smoking amongst current and potential smokers. The tobacco industry has long understood the powerful marketing significance of cigarette packaging. It is widely recognized that the tobacco industry treats cigarette packaging as a critical marketing spot and invests significant research dollars to make their package design appealing to specific demographic groups, especially young people.<br />
 <br />
As noted by the distinguished scholar Simon Chapman in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>, "neutering the appeal of the once glamorous cigarette package has become a powerful weapon in tobacco control's arsenal." Instead of the traditional "glamorous" cigarette package, smokers in almost 50 countries today have to pull cigarettes out of a pack that contains large pictures of a diseased organ, a dissected lung or a limp penis. As Chapman notes, such graphic health warnings are part of a process of "denormalisation" of tobacco products. Plain packaging is the crowning next step in the "denormalisation" process by, as Chapman describes, "sending an unambiguous message that tobacco is unique in the marketplace as an exceptionally hazardous product."<br />
 <br />
Although phrased as an investment dispute unrelated to health issues, the PMA investment dispute is at its core a clear effort to restrict the plenary authority of a sovereign nation to protect the public health of its population. PMA's investment dispute claims that Australia is in breach of the <a  href="http://www.legislation.gov.hk/IPPAAustraliae.PDF">Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty</a> [PDF] because the mandated plain packaging:<ul><li>Constitutes unlawful expropriation of PMA's investments and intellectual property without compensation (Article 6.1);</li><li>Fails to provide for equitable and fair treatment to PMA's Australian investments (Article 2(2));</li><li>Unreasonably impairs PMA's investments in Australia (Article 2(2));</li><li>Fails to provide full protection and security for PMA's investments in Australia (Article 2(2)); and</li><li>Breaches Australia's international obligations in relation to PMA's investments (Article 2(2)) by violating the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm">Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights</a> (TRIPS), the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/trtdocs_wo020.html">Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property</a> and the WTO Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade.</li></ul>PMA's use of the dispute resolution provisions of the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty is the newest piece in an emerging pattern of the tobacco industry invoking the international investment rules of bilateral investments treaties (BITs) to challenge the authority of governments to protect public health through measures designed to restrict cigarette marketing. In February 2010, Philip Morris alleged that Uruguay's new tobacco regulations, which mandated that health warnings cover 80 percent of the package, violated several provisions of the Switzerland-Uruguay BIT and filed a request for arbitration with the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Notably, in 1994, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) threatened to bring a claim against Canada's proposed plain packaging legislation under the investment chapter of the <a href="http://www.nafta-sec-alena.org/en/view.aspx?conID=590">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (NAFTA). Although the plain packaging initiative in Canada ultimately failed in 1995 when the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/1995/1995scr3-199/1995scr3-199.html">invalidated</a> the Canadian Tobacco Products Control Act, it is widely believed that the RJR NAFTA threat deterred the Canadian government from instituting plain packaging before the Court ruling and had a chilling effect on the public health regulatory ambitions of other countries.<br />
 <br />
As Australia is the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, the legal dispute with PMA under the Australian-Hong Kong Investment treaty will be closely followed around the world, especially in countries such as the UK, Canada and New Zealand, which have been considering measures to severely limit cigarette branding to protect public health. It is of significant concern that the mere fact of this arbitration as well as the potential negative outcome may induce "regulatory chill" in other countries, especially in low-income states that do not have the resources to battle the tobacco industry. PMA is, undoubtedly, seeking to advance this "regulatory chill" by publicly announcing that it expects the arbitration to take several years and result in billions of dollars in compensatory damages.<br />
 <br />
The use of BIT investor-state arbitration provisions to dampen governmental efforts to regulate the marketing of tobacco products, including plain packaging, is a troubling development for national and global tobacco control.  Countries need to redouble efforts and develop new strategies and measures to ensure that these agreements are not manipulated by the tobacco industry and that states retain the right to protect their populations. Unlike relevant WTO agreements, including TRIPS, bilateral investment treaties do not generally include provisions that provide states with flexibility to protect public health. In addition, despite the compelling public interest in this case, the Australian arbitration hearings, which PMA has requested be held under the rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law, may be conducted in private, outside of Australia and by an ad hoc tribunal. Further, the proceedings may be completely lacking in transparency with neither the pleadings nor the final award ever made public.<br />
 <br />
Australia has announced that it will oppose the inclusion of investor-state arbitration in future free trade agreements, in part because of the challenges posed by the tobacco industry to its plain packaging legislation. It has also been widely recommended that Australia terminate or renegotiate existing bilateral treaties that have the potential to be manipulated by the tobacco industry. In light of the emerging trend of the tobacco industry to use BITs to block national public health measures, all states should strongly consider the need to renegotiate investment treaties to include exceptions for the protection of public health as well as eliminate investor-state arbitration provisions. </p>

		<title>Drone Strikes in Pakistan: Examining Consent in International Law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://lums.edu.pk/faculty/people_detail.php?id=TkRBPQ">Sikander Ahmed Shah</a> of Lahore University of Management Sciences Department of Law and Policy says that whether US drone strikes in Pakistan are illegal hinges on the nature of consent given and whether actions exceed that consent ... <br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/SikanderShah.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><b>T</b></font>he recent killings of 24 Pakistani soldiers by NATO air strikes at the Salala check point in Mohmand has caused intense anger in Pakistan, leading to the government boycotting the Bonn talks. As part of its protest, Pakistan has demanded that the US vacate the Shamsi Air Base within 15 days. It is widely believed that the Shamsi base has been regularly used by the US for drone and associated surveillance flights. </p>

<p>US drone strikes in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are deeply resented by the Pakistani population. Officially, the government has vociferously condemned these operations as illegal under international law and a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/pakistan-president-says-us-air-strike.php">violation of its territorial sovereignty</a>. In the absence of certain extenuating circumstances, the overwhelming majority of international law experts would find the drone strikes in FATA to be <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">illegal under international law</a>. They do not qualify as acts of self-defense as definition under Article 51 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> and thus violate Article 2(4), which upholds the territorial integrity of a state.</p>

<p>The drone attacks also fail to meet the self-defense standard of customary international law, which requires immediacy, necessity and proportionality for using force in self-defense. Firstly, there is no instant or overwhelming danger posed to the US if it does not conduct drone attacks in Pakistan. </p>

<p>The attacks are unnecessary because other peaceful modes and means of facing the threat have not been exhausted given the time parameters involved. Such operations are also unnecessary as rather than diminishing the threat and dangers faced the gravity of the threat posed is augmented by such attacks. The attacks are not proportional in relation to the wrong suffered by the US keeping in mind the partial disconnect between those responsible for the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> and those being targeted and because of the intervening events over the course of a decade. Drone strikes are also not proportional considering the nature and the magnitude of force used to achieve US objectives. The killing of scores of innocent civilians and other forms of serious collateral damage is strong evidence in support of this determination.</p>

<p>However, the legal analysis of US drone strikes in FATA does not end here. The fact that Pakistan has now demanded that the US vacate the Shamsi Air Base establishes at a minimum its earlier acquiescence or implicit authorization in how the base was being used. The question to ask is whether the level of such authorization qualified Pakistan as consenting to drone attacks with the result that the US had neither violated Pakistan's sovereignty nor undertaken a wrongful or unlawful act against it. In other words was there the presence of consensual intervention involving the use of force? </p>

<p>Under Article 20 of the International Law Commission's Articles of State Responsibility, consent provided by one state removes responsibility for wrongful actions against another. Under Article 26, however, consent and other contingencies that excuse or justify otherwise wrongful acts for ascertaining state responsibility cannot be invoked if the same acts are not in conformity with an obligation arising under a peremptory norm (<em>jus cogens</em>) of general international law. In other words, a state cannot consent to the commission of an unlawful acts on its territory that involve acts of aggression, slavery, racial discrimination, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, etc.  </p>

<p>Interestingly under customary international law the prohibition of the use of force against another state is now widely accepted as a preemptory norm; though whether the right of self determination has achieved such a status is highly doubtful. It is fair to say that if a state provides free consent, which has not been effected by coercion, deceit or mistake and allows another country to carry out attacks on its territory it would most probably not be a violation of the preemptory norm of the prohibition of the use of force even though it might come in conflict with the right of self-determination. However, if the attacks qualify as unlawful aggression under international law or exceed the amount of force originally consented to then state wrongfulness will not be precluded. </p>

<p>Consent can be accorded on behalf of the state by an official who operates within the scope of his authority keeping in mind the character of the act consented to.  </p>

<p>Therefore, in order to determine whether the drone attacks carried out in FATA are wrongful under international law, a number of questions need to be answered, including: (1) whether Pakistan consented to drone strikes on its territory freely; (2) whether the US exceeded the ambit of attacks authorized; (3) whether the attacks amount to aggression or were violative of <em>jus cogens</em>; and (4) whether the appropriate organ or agent of the Pakistani government sanctioned these drone strikes. One can only determine the legality or wrongfulness of the drone strikes once these questions have been answered.  </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.wfu.edu/faculty/profile/gilreasd/">Shannon Gilreath</a> of Wake Forest University School of Law says that the current litigation strategy seeking marriage rights for same-sex couples only tinkers around the edges of heteronormative institutions when it should be seeking separate institutions that reject these gender role-dominated institutions...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/shannongilreath2.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>J</strong></font>URIST recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ACLU-appeals-dismissal-of-same-sex-couples-benefits-to-Montana-high-court.php">reported</a> that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was appealing a decision by a Montana district judge to dismiss a lawsuit by six same-sex couples seeking partnership benefits. What I find most interesting is that the plaintiffs in <em>Donaldson and Guggenheim v. Montana</em> are not seeking marriage, but rather partnership benefits that will entitle them to make the same sorts of family decisions about the medical care of partners, finances and inheritance that heterosexual married couples are able to make as a matter of form. For me, the plaintiffs' strategy underscores the current split in the gay movement itself, with one side, the "gay rights" side, in pursuit of marriage at any and all costs. The other side, what I call the gay liberation side, is clinging to the principles of the early, incandescent years of our movement, when it was really a rebellion, of destroying gender as a category of analysis, of destabilizing the nuclear family unit, and of liberating sexuality. Since the Gay Activists Alliance split from the New York Gay Liberation Front in late 1969, those liberation principles have been steadily replaced with assimilationist policies that tell gay people that in order to be valuable we must look like, act like and behave like straight people. </p>

<p>Standard dictionary meaning for "equal" is "the same in amount, degree, value, or quality; equivalent; adequate, as, equal to the undertaking: used in compounds to denote balance, fairness, as equal-handed. Syn. Equivalent." This is the definition of equal that gay rights activists have embraced, a purely formal definition through which equality means equivalence. Gay rights advocates have sought to establish gay as equivalent to straight in virtually every aspect, in the process valorizing heterosexuality by casting homosexuality as a mere reflection of its domestic wholesomeness &#8212; insisting to the hetero powerbrokers that we do all the things straight people do in domestic bliss: we share meals together, spend time with our families, and make love in the hetero-romantic image. These arguments were seen in <a href="http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/docket/2002/march.html">amici briefs</a> in <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em>. This method has been remarkably successful in, for example, enabling the US Supreme Court to recognize a right to sexual privacy for gays in that case, by transforming the actual relationship at issue, one of no-strings-attached encounters, into an enduring domestic union in the fictionalized hetero-model. It has also been remarkably successful in this country's same-sex marriage advocacy in courts and legislatures, where plaintiffs have been carefully chosen and where, generally, all gay relationships look alike. These model relationships are long-term, presumably monogamous, and ubiquitously involve children, where children are offered up as proof that gay coupling is as valuable as straight coupling, a direct reply to that premier criticism of same-sex intimacy that it cannot result in procreation. <br />
        	<br />
Without question, <em>Lawrence</em> is a major leap forward in the jurisprudence made by straight people that governs gay people's lives, as are the marriage cases, which do vindicate gay people's interests in access to all of the rewards attendant to settling down. I do not dismiss these gains, except to say that there are very few voices today that question the darker aspects of settling down, let alone settling, and that an alternative to this formalism &#8212; a substantive equality theory and litigation strategy that does not require gay people to bargain away their moral integrity &#8212; has barely been imagined, let alone tried. Certainly, few are now suggesting that we re-envision the way we value and reward relationships, sexual relationships in particular, in the ways that <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/card/">Claudia Card</a> or <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Gays_justice.html?id=dfUw8Zl0kPEC">Richard Mohr</a> have urged. </p>

<p>Over the years, the center of gravity in our movement has shifted. Some of us have committed ourselves to equality in form and function, especially with regard to "love," "romance" or "commitment." We believe that if we are "equivalent" enough, then even <em>they</em> may come to value us. This is an investment in <em>their</em> equality. Others of us, myself included, hope for an equality that is also just, one in which gay people have not only access to certain institutional rewards, but also a say in defining the standards by which value is measured. Equality in relationships is not, for us, a sufficient goal when the ownership and gender-role polarization inherent in the heterosexual sexual model goes unexamined and unchallenged. Quite simply, equality is not enough for us if it means only the ability to be the same as the oppressor, equally as exploitative, as immoral. For us, all oppression is built on, patterned after, sustained by the paradigm of male over female domination that has defined the institution of marriage for thousands of years. Everything heterosexuality is, and everything it has done to us, is tied irrevocably to marriage and what it represents and to what has been accomplished through it. To recognize this is, of course, to understand that heterosexuals have invented sex itself, as we experience it, as well as the linguistic register with which we have to define ourselves in relation to it, let alone attempt to resist it. This gives a grim poignancy to Kristin Perry's testimony in <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> that without the word "marriage" to describe her relationship to her partner of 10 years she lacked the ability to convey the importance of that relationship to the straight world around her. Surely, as Monique Wittig <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_straight_mind_and_other_essays.html?id=TYfUqBeX9ZUC">observed</a>, the "discourses of heterosexuality" are totalizing. </p>

<p>It is appealing to believe that if gays get married then millennia of patriarchal/heteroarchal customs will somehow be reversed. There is no data to support this, however. What I am saying here is that "equality" within this model can only perpetuate the model itself, and can only leave space for a tinkering around the edges. Gay liberation never intended to tinker at the edges of straight supremacy, never intended to content itself with meager reforms to masculinized dominance, never accepted duality in the hetero-model as a given or as intrinsically valuable. Gay liberation aimed for radical transformation. What I find myself questioning, more and more, is why we gave in. This is to say nothing about the specificity of any particular relationship, gay or straight. People have always been able to work out more or less equalitarian relationships, one-on-one. Gay liberation has never been about exceptionality as progress; it has been, by contrast, about revolutionizing the structure, working from the ground up &#8212; about challenging heterosexuality and the institutional prerogatives derived from it, perhaps especially marriage. No inarticulable, abstract reform has accomplished this goal &#8212; has not and will not.  </p>

<p>I believe that we, the gay movement, have missed an opportunity to alter the structure. Why have we not insisted on something of our own making, call it civil union, or domestic partnership, or what you will &#8212; something other than marriage that does not come with its patriarchal baggage. Certainly, we could question whether we should involve ourselves in the entirely irrational state-enforcement of fictionalized monogamous relationships and nuclear family units through a system of caste-based reward. But we live in a country that does not afford its citizens the most basic of human dignities, access to healthcare for example, and where such "privileges" are often conditioned on coupling in the heterosexual model. I want gay people to have <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care</a> too! The salient question for me is why, if we could get access to health care, to our loved ones in times of crisis, control over the distribution of our assets after we die, and so on, without acquiescing in an institution built for millennia on a foundation of male ownership of female bodies, would we not do it? I think we have missed a huge opportunity to say pointedly that we reject the heterosexual philosophy in favor of something better, as well as the opportunity to bring enlightened heterosexuals along with us into a world in which the omission of the intrinsic bondage of "honor and obey" is not merely the exception but the rule.  <br />
	<br />
Litigating marriage is not about "partnership" rights and it is time we stop posturing as if it were. I do not pretend to know the sexual politics of the plaintiffs in <em>Donaldson and Guggenheim v. Montana</em>. I am on record as opposing the sexual politics of the ACLU in many respects, not the least of which is their insistence on formal equality only in matters of sexuality, or their blinkered defense of anti-gay speech, or their valorization of pornography as "speech." But this is not to say they cannot get things right from time to time. All I am saying is that, taking the relief they are requesting at face value, I have a lot more respect for the Montana plaintiffs than for what is going on in California and the Ninth Circuit right now. Let us pursue the bundle of rights at stake in much same-sex partnership litigation if we must &#8212; because we need them to survive, to become stronger. But "marriage" is something different altogether, pursued aggressively to the exclusion of all else. This is what I think we should put aside, a posture we should abandon. We would all be better off if we returned to the truly revolutionary values of gay liberation, and perhaps also to separatism in the name of an equality that is substantive and just.</p>

Obama</em> construes the presumption of regularity in a way that creates an unfair obstacle for military detainees trying to question the evidence used to justify their detention...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/tungyin.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <em>Latif v. Obama</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/dc-circuit-overturns-release-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">released a heavily-redacted decision</a> that either abdicates much of the judiciary's ability to review executive detention of Guantanamo Bay detainees, if the dissent is correct, or simply applies a commonly used presumption that will have no practical effect in most detainee challenges, if the majority is correct. <em>Latif</em> is a complicated decision, and any assessment of its impact on detainee litigation is, at this point, necessarily speculative. For example, it took Ben Wittes of <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/?s=%22Thoughts+on+Latif%22&searchsubmit=GO">Lawfare</a> five blog entries with various reflections to reach the conclusion that it is both "important" and "regrettable."</p>

<p>The publicly known facts of <em>Latif</em> are sparse, as the equivalent of two out of three pages in the fact section of the majority opinion have been blacked out. In fact, what is left is decidedly one-sided: Latif's side, which comes from a 2009 declaration that the detainee filed in connection with his <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. Though the government's version remains classified, one can infer from Latif's version that he was captured in Pakistan in late 2001 or early 2002, after having been in Afghanistan at some point around or after September 11, 2001. Latif was subsequently sent to the detention facility at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>When Latif <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-grants-yemeni-guantanamo-detainees-habeas-petition.php">challenged his detention</a> through a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, as permitted under the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002241----000-.html">habeas corpus statute</a> and the Supreme Court's decisions in <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/us-supreme-court-rules-that-foreign.htm">Rasul v. Bush</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">Boumediene v. Bush</a>, the government bore the burden of proving his status as a combatant subject to detention under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:s.j.res.00023:/">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a>. Here too the exact details remain unknown, as the opinion states, "[a]t the heart of the Government's case is" with the rest of the paragraph blacked out. What is clear is that the government relied crucially on an intelligence report that apparently collected and laid out the evidence against Latif.</p>

<p>In ruling in favor of Latif, the district court rejected the government's argument that the intelligence report was entitled to a presumption of regularity &#8212; meaning that the government record (the report, in this case) was accurately produced. </p>

<p>A two-judge majority in the DC Circuit (made up of Judges Brown and Henderson) reversed the lower court, concluding that government intelligence reports were indeed entitled to a presumption of regularity. The essence of the court's decision was that the presumption of regularity only presumes that the report accurately and faithfully records what the author was told. It does not, however, apply to the underlying information that is the subject of the report. In other words, if an intelligence agent were to write that a witness claimed that a detainee was a member of al Qaeda, the court would presume that the report correctly reports the witness's claim, but the claim itself would not be presumed accurate. The court justified this presumption on the ground that "courts have no special expertise in evaluating the nature and reliability of the Executive branch's wartime records." In dissent, Judge Tatel argued that the presumption of regularity was unwarranted because intelligence reports are often produced under chaotic battlefield conditions, thus increasing the chance of mistakes or other problems. In addition, he argued that the process of generating these intelligence reports is so foreign to courts and lacking in transparency that courts should not credit them with regularity.</p>

<p>The best that can be said in support of the majority position is that, without a presumption of regularity, the government may often be unable to defend the accuracy of its intelligence report because the author(s) are unavailable, or dead. It would be easy for a detainee to assert that a report is inaccurate, and difficult, if not impossible, for the government to rebut the assertion with specificity. This is why the presumption of regularity is useful for government activities such as mail delivery and court proceedings; it cannot be reasonably expected that a mail carrier will remember a specific mail delivery, but we can expect that, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the mail carrier would have carried out his or her duties.</p>

<p>Application of the presumption of regularity to intelligence reports, however, will likely undermine a detainee's ability to test the government's evidence against him. Consider how hearsay evidence would be attacked if it were generally admissible in civilian courts. A witness testifies that someone else claims to have heard the defendant confess to the crime in question. Assuming that the third party does not testify in the trial (which is the reason the hearsay is being presented through the witness), the defense can cast doubt on the validity of the third party's claim (i.e., the defendant did not confess, the third party has some bias against the defendant, etc.). However, the defense is not limited to attacking the third party's claim; the defense can also cross-examine the witness directly, not just about bias against the defendant, but also about whether the witness heard the third party accurately. That is, even if the witness is testifying in good faith, he or she might be mistaken. The presumption of regularity in this context effectively strips the detainee of the ability to cross-examine the equivalent of the testifying witness.</p>

<p><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1919795851550044254">Barhoumi v. Obama</a>, an earlier detainee case that was the subject of disagreement between the majority and the dissent, provides a concrete example of the problem. The basic facts of the case and the holding were not in dispute; rather, the fight over <em>Barhoumi</em> concerned the degree of scrutiny that the earlier opinion had exhibited toward the reliability of an English translation of a captured fighter's diary, written in Arabic, that proved crucial in confirming Barhoumi's combatant status. According to the <em>Latif</em> majority, the court had not applied the presumption of regularity because the district court judge had denied the detainee's <em>habeas</em> petition, and the DC Circuit was reviewing only for clear error. On the other hand, Judge Tatel (who wrote <em>Barhoumi</em>) noted that the translation of the diary was not presumed correct, and that while the court ultimately ruled in favor of the government, it first accepted that the translation made the diary "somewhat less reliable" than if the government had made the original diary available to the detainee.</p>

<p>The <em>Latif</em> majority elided the question of whether the presumption of regularity should have applied to the translation of the diary. Did the government accurately translate the diary? Unlike the question of whether a piece of mail was delivered, or whether a court document accurately stated the court's decision, the government would be in a position to demonstrate that the diary was translated accurately: it could produce the original diary.</p>

<p>An intelligence report, to be sure, presents a more difficult question, since the author, as well as the subject(s) of the report, might be unavailable (though the subjects might be unavailable only because the government does not want to expose them to anyone other than their captors and interrogators). At most, that distinction might weigh in favor of the presumption of regularity for intelligence reports, but not translations of foreign-language documents. Drawing the line there requires accepting the fact that, with intelligence reports, the presumption of regularity essentially favors the government over the detainee in a situation where the underlying evidence or witness is unavailable. Perhaps that is a defensible cost-benefit analysis. Yet, the <em>Latif</em> majority went further than that. It avoided drawing a line, but in doing so, it took away the opportunity for detainees to challenge the accuracy of government reports even in instances when the government arguably would have faced no actual or security-related difficulties in permitting such a challenge to proceed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/jules-lobel">Jules Lobel</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that if the Occupy Movement can create organizational forms that combine its democratic, egalitarian origins with ongoing direct action, a narrative of solidarity, equality and democracy over the long term, it will have made a major contribution in transforming the public dialogue and birthing a new society...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/juleslobel.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Occupy Movement, which has already been hugely successful in thrusting issues of inequality and corporate power into the public discourse, faces a critical juncture. As many of the larger encampments in New York, Oakland, Philadelphia and Los Angeles are shut down by the police, activists have been searching for the tactics to move beyond Occupation to Phase 2 of the movement. Some say that the movement now should evolve into the political arena, supporting policy ideas, running candidates for office, and putting pressure on politicians and corporations. Similarly, others argue that the next step is to develop a specific list of demands, which presumably could further policy initiatives and protests.</p>

<p>A different tactical response is to create what essentially would be a non-violent guerrilla movement in American cities. For example, Kalle Lasn, the <em>Adbuster</em> magazine publisher and originator of the Wall Street encampment idea, reportedly urged a new "swarming strategy of surprise attacks against business as usual." The Chicago occupiers have resolved to have an event a day throughout the winter, such as defending foreclosed homes, sit-ins, banner drops, building parks, providing supplies to the homeless, or guerrilla theater and art. In the same vein, longtime social movement scholar and activist Francis Fox Piven foresaw some time ago that the movement would develop new phases, utilizing "other forms of disruptive protests that are punchier than occupying a square," or "rolling occupations of public space."</p>

<p>This article suggests another alternative, one that focuses on creating sustainable alternative decentralized institutions that reflect in microcosm the egalitarian, democratic  vision of society that the Occupy Movement has put forth. Such a strategy would be combined with a continual presence in the streets and parks around issues of injustice such as foreclosures.</p>

<p>While determining the tactics of the next phase is critical to keeping the movement alive over the next weeks and months, the broader strategic goal is that of developing a truly long-term movement to transform society &#8212; measured not in seasons, but years or even decades. That task is one of sustainability. How can the Occupy Movement (OWS) develop the organizational, cultural and institutional forms to sustain a long term movement, yet also maintain its dynamism, horizontalism, direct democracy, creativity, activism and transformative vision? No American social or political movement of the twentieth century has been able to do so.</p>

<p>The 1960s civil rights and 1930s CIO trade union movements initially had much of the activism, creativity and direct democracy now exhibited by OWS. They utilized street protests, sit-ins, factory occupations and boycotts. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and some of the radical CIO unions practiced direct, participatory democracy. Their movements changed American society and resulted in lasting, meaningful reforms &#8212; which if OWS succeeds in emulating would be a remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>Those movements failed to achieve many activists' goal of an egalitarian society, however. Perhaps more importantly, they were unsuccessful in sustaining their creativity, dynamism, activism and vision in some non-bureaucratic forms or institutions that could continue the long-term fight to transform an unjust society into a just one. They seized the radical moment and achieved important reforms, but failed to sustain their transformative vision. Can OWS avoid that fate over the long haul?</p>

<p>There is no road map or magic formula for success in that project. Indeed, OWS's spirit of creative experimentation and of an openness to new ideas must be at the heart of any effort to move beyond what has been accomplished in the past. As Naomi Klein put it in her speech to OWS, being horizontal and deeply democratic "are compatible with the hard work of building structures and institutions that are sturdy enough to weather the storms ahead." But what lessons have we learned to help us in the long term task?</p>

<p><strong>Lessons of OWS</strong></p>

<p>Five main attributes of OWS have contributed to its massive success and provide the basis for its continuation as a radical alternative in the future.</p>

<p>1. <u>Presenting a Narrative, World View or Declaration &#8212; Not Specific Demands</u><br />
Until OWS, the left had not set forth an alternative narrative to that of the right or democratic party liberals. Such a narrative explains to people why we are in our present mess, who and what is responsible for our predicament, and offers a broad solution. The right has such a narrative: the evil is big government and the solution is to cut taxes and government spending. The liberal narrative tends to be that the lack of government oversight and a rigid adherence to free market capitalism is the problem and that more government regulation is the answer. The left has all too often simply presented a m&#233;lange of programmatic demands and a defense of government programs.</p>

<p>OWS presented a competing narrative that resonated with millions of people: corporate power and greed got us into this mess, the only way out is for the 99% to stand together to demand equality, justice and fairness. It is that broad perspective, narrative or worldview &#8212; as opposed to a laundry list of demands &#8212; that helped change the political debate. People see the world through a broad lens or framework &#8212; to convince or move them is not primarily a logical or factual process, but one of providing a lens or framework with which to view reality. OWS did just that.</p>

<p>OWS was able to connect equality to liberty in a manner that allowed people to see gross inequality as morally unjust. As others have observed, since the 1970s, both conservatives and liberals have focused on individual liberty, privacy and autonomy (albeit in different areas, guns versus reproductive freedom), while paying little or no attention to equality. Indeed, the original 1787 Constitution omitted any mention of equality, focusing solely on liberty, and requiring a bloody Civil War and the post-war Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to include equal rights in our basic governing document. OWS focused the nation's attention on the fact that for most folks (the 99%), individual liberty is incomplete or even a hollow shell without social and economic equality and justice, as international human rights principles now recognize. Thus, OWS's narrative refocused the national debate on equality.</p>

<p>Finally, that OWS's basic document was a declaration which seemingly tracked the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence &#8212; substituting corporate power for King George, issuing a list of grievances against corporate power instead of the King, and announcing occupation of the illegitimate power and not independence from it &#8212; emphasized that the goal was to set forth a narrative which would shift and galvanize the public debate and not simply present demands to the government. Neither the OWS nor the 1776 Declaration demanded a list of reforms; rather they both highlighted the illegitimacy of the ruling regime, as did OWS's not seeking a permit to occupy the square.</p>

<p>Some have argued that while the broad critique was appropriate at the outset, now the movement needs more specific programmatic demands. While OWS has and should continue to involve itself in particular struggles around particular issues &#8212; for example stopping foreclosures &#8212; its uniqueness and vitality is contained in its ability to present an indictment of current reality and a broad, amorphous perspective on what should be done. The Occupy Movement can be thus viewed as a prophetic movement, reminding people of basic values. As OWS activist Katie Davison pointed out in <em>The Nation</em>, "We need a movement of solidarity that is about values first." These values are not foreign to the left, or for that matter to most Americans. OWS has recalled them to us, and any adequate movement forward will have to keep them before people's minds.</p>

<p>2. <u>Political Independence</u><br />
OWS, unlike many unions and progressive coalitions, chose not to focus on elections, the legislative process or lobbying. While engaging in the electoral arena or having an impact on legislation are important, OWS's contribution and vitality would be undermined by running candidates or engaging in lobbying. Rather OWS started in the streets (or parks) and ought to remain there as a beacon of hope for the future and a means of putting pressure on corporations and politicians from outside the political system.</p>

<p>As a constitutional and human rights lawyer, I recognize the value of specific reforms that can sometimes be won in the electoral arena, in legislative forums or in courts. But I also have seen that often the most important reforms are achieved by pressure from outside of the system, by people acting independently of political parties or lobbying efforts and that entering such established arenas can often hamstring social and political movements. OWS has already had an effect on specific issues such as the Keystone XL pipeline issue, as Naomi Klein recently pointed out. But even more importantly, OWS has stirred for many the desire to move beyond specific reforms, to act on our aspirations for a fundamentally different type of society that is democratic and egalitarian. Only by maintaining its independence from parties and traditional institutions can OWS continue to inspire those hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>3. <u>Non-Violence, Creativity, Experimentation and Inclusiveness</u><br />
I include these attributes as one because they are all related. The occupation encampments encompassed a diverse group of very creative activists who debated various issues and a range of solutions without dogmatic, fixed preconceptions. Many of us were captivated by the energy, creativity and ability to reach consensus exhibited at the numerous occupations around the country.</p>

<p>4. <u>Visible, Not Transitory Presence</u><br />
The occupations, unlike a one-shot demonstration, had continual visible staying power. As Naomi Klein and Francis Fox Piven have pointed out, the occupiers put no end date to their presence, and said they were staying put. That made them an ongoing real presence which could not be ignored, neither by the media nor by public opinion. This is in contrast to recent demonstrations that have been easily forgotten, when they reached public consciousness at all. Moreover, OWS has been able to bridge the gap that often separates virtual from actual politics. It utilized media technology, but because it was a constant presence, there was a continual feedback loop between the images that were transmitted across various media and the ongoing presence of the occupation itself.</p>

<p>The first definition of the term "occupy" in Webster's dictionary is "to engage the attention or energies of," and the occupy movement succeeded by its continual visual presence in engaging the public's attention. Even without the space in those cities in which the encampments have been shut down, the occupy movement must find ways to continue to visually occupy the attention of millions of Americans, the media, and the elite.</p>

<p>5. <u>Creating Alternative Models of What a Democratic Egalitarian Society Might Look Like</u><br />
Perhaps the most critical component of OWS is its creation of alternative communities which reflect the egalitarian, democratic world that its activists seek for the future. Sometimes referred to as "pre-figurative politics," this perspective seeks to create in microcosm the alternative models that reflect the future world that the activists support, while at the same time using those institutions to engage in direct action to change the current reality. By creating a community dedicated to solidarity, consensus decision-making, everyone's participation, respect for everyone's opinion, and equality, OWS attempted to demonstrate that another world is possible, not in theory but in practice. That effort creates hope for a radically different future, which in many respects is more or equally important than winning particular demands. As Matthias Schwartz pointed out in a recent New Yorker article, "In the end, the point of Occupy Wall Street is not its platform so much as its form, people sit down and hash things out instead of passing their complaints on to Washington." As the slogan around the encampment went, "We are our demands."</p>

<p><strong>Future</strong></p>

<p>When I went to the Occupy Pittsburgh encampment &#8212; which is still ongoing &#8212; I asked several people there what they saw as its future. A young English graduate student's answer lay in the community, in developing a concrete alternative rooted in equality, solidarity and democracy. For her, the OWS was a way of her expressing her vision of the future. To me, the long term viability of the OWS movement as a transformative movement lies in the creation of these communities, which not only directly practice what they believe, but seek to reach out and effect the public consciousness through direct action. Perhaps Noam Chomsky said it best in his speech to Occupy Boston:<br />
"The Occupy outposts are trying to create cooperative communities that just might be the basis for the kinds of lasting organizations necessary to overcome the barriers ahead and the backlash that's already coming."</p>

<p>There are many groups which are trying to create alternative models in microcosm: food co-ops, farmer markets, cooperative renewable energy projects. Indeed many of these groups have united in an umbrella formation known as the solidarity economy. But none of these groups have captivated the public as has OWS, and very few combine direct action with community building.</p>

<p>Other movements in the past have attempted to create such democratic, egalitarian institutions.  As William Greider has pointed out, the Populist movement of the late nineteenth century created a series of ingenious agricultural and credit cooperatives, which were eventually destroyed by the money classes and bankers. He asks, "what is it we can build that is parallel to that cooperative movement?" But we must also seek to learn why that cooperative movement was unable to survive, and what can be done differently. So too, SNCC and its supporters created community-controlled day care centers, and at least in one prominent case, an agricultural cooperative, but these efforts were also destroyed and we need to understand why the civil rights movement was unable to sustain these radical, democratic structures.</p>

<p>Yet an important accomplishment of the Occupy Movement is to rekindle the hope that these alternative communities of solidarity can grow. There are reasons to be hopeful. The bankruptcy of an economic order which threatens our very existence has led to the growth of co-operative, environmentally friendly, alternative institutions. Moreover, there currently exist organizations such as the National Lawyers Guild, Center for Constitutional Rights, or City Life/Urbana Vida, a Boston anti-foreclosure group, that have for decades sustained a radical vision and practice, as well as an anti-elitist, democratic internal structure, which OWS and other groups can learn from in building the creative cooperative structures they envision. Lessons can also be gleaned from movements around the world which have created such autonomous communities, whether it be the Zapatistas in Mexico, the Brazilian landless movement, or the Mondragon cooperatives in Spain.<br />
                    	<br />
Hopefully OWS can create organizational forms that combine its democratic, egalitarian origins with audacious, ongoing direct action, an overall narrative that continues to express values of solidarity, equality and democracy, and political independence and survive as a model of how a just society would operate. If OWS can do so over the long term, it will have made a major contribution, not simply to transforming the public dialogue, but to birthing a new society.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.pace.edu/school-of-law/faculty-0/full-time-faculty/cassuto-david-n">David Cassuto</a> of Pace Law School says the Belo Monte project that has been embroiled in litigation for decades has gained momentum and even a sense of inevitability despite widespread protests and threats of violence from the indigenous tribes whose lands and lives are at risk, but overcoming legal hurdles does not necessarily mean the dam is worth it...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/davidcassuto.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n 2010, a Brazilian colleague and I were invited to lecture on environmental permitting at the Federal University of Par&#225; in Belem, Brazil. The state of Par&#225; is to be home to the proposed Belo Monte Dam. Nonetheless, we deliberately chose not to discuss the dam. Feelings run so strongly on both sides of the issue that it seemed presumptuous for a North American (me) and a Brazilian from the south of the country (my colleague) to swoop into the region and opine on such a controversial topic. We decided instead to speak in general terms about the vagaries of permitting. However, because permits lie at the heart of the Belo Monte legal battle, the title of the talk led some to think that we would be discussing the dam. The room filled with partisans.</p>

<p>During the Q&amp;A, someone asked the inevitable Belo Monte question. Even as I attempted to stammer out a diplomatic deflection, an audience-member jumped up, declared "I can answer that," put his laptop under his arm, and strode to the podium. He then delivered a 25 minute disquisition on why Belo Monte was both legal and desirable. In all of the scores of talks I have given all over the world (and all over Brazil), I have never seen anything like that. But then, Belo Monte inspires behaviors one does not often see. For example, a few years ago, a Kayap&#243; woman placed her machete against the face of an Eletronorte representative and demanded that the dams not be built. When considering the legal landscape of Belo Monte, it is worth surveying the cultural and physical geography as well.</p>

<p>From an engineering perspective, the Belo Monte site is a veritable dreamscape. It offers an 87.5 meter drop in elevation and an average streamflow of 7851 cubic meters per second. Once complete, it will be the world's third largest dam. However, the dam will also back up the Xingu River and create significant disruption and possible dislocation of the Arara, Juruna and Kayap&#243; peoples who live downstream. The litigation and social unrest generated by the Belo Monte debate offer an unvarnished albeit confusing look into the still turbulent world of Brazilian environmental law and policy, particularly in the Amazon. Indigenous rights, Amazon conservation, energy and environmental policy and the bare-knuckled, often mercenary realm of Brazilian politics are all implicated. Meanwhile, the judicial opinions issued in the last several months reveal that the matter remains far from resolved.      </p>

<p>Proposed in 1987 by Electrobras, a Brazilian power company, Belo Monte formed part of a massive six-dam project. Rampant opposition led to the tabling of five of the dams as well as the renaming of the remaining one ("Belo Monte" &#8212; which means "Beautiful Hill" &#8212; used to be called "Karar&#227;o," which is a Kayap&#243; war cry). Cost estimates for the dam run to $17 billion, with principal funding coming from the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES). Though the dam could theoretically generate 11,233 megawatts, during the three to five month dry season it would only work at 10 percent of capacity. That means that over the course of the year, the dam would produce a total of 4,462 megawatts &#8212; 39 percent of its nominal capacity. In addition, 30 percent of that 39 percent will go to power aluminum refineries and other extractive industries in the region. Furthermore, the other five dams that formed part of the initial project have never been conclusively dismissed. Many fear that if Belo Monte goes forward, the other dams will soon follow.  </p>

<p>For these and many other reasons, the project has been embroiled in litigation for decades. However, during the last six years, it has gained momentum and even a sense of inevitability despite widespread protests and threats of violence from the indigenous tribes whose lands and lives are at risk. Under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Belo Monte project was declared a priority. In 2005, notwithstanding lingering questions about the completeness of the environmental impact review and vehement resistance from the affected indigenous groups, the legislature fast-tracked the dam's construction. More litigation followed. The Federal Public Prosecutor's Office sued, claiming that the indigenous peoples had not been consulted as required by Article 231 of the <a href="http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleVIII.html">Brazilian Constitution</a>. Nevertheless, Lula's successor, President Dilma Rousseff, has continued to push for the dam's construction.</p>

<p>Between September and November 2011, a divided federal court ruled in favor of the project (in Brazil, judicial panels release opinions one at a time). The first judge to opine, Judge Selene Maria de Almeida, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/brazil-judge-blocks-amazon-jungle-dam-construction.php">stated</a> that the project could not go forward. She cited the failure to consult with affected indigenous communities as well as violations of Brazil's international obligations under <a href="http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Conventions/no169/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization Convention No. 169</a> and other international agreements protecting indigenous peoples. A second judge, Judge Sebastiao Fagundes de Deus, quickly disagreed, stating that the dam's licensing requirements mitigated any potential damage to indigenous lands and that the project as licensed was legal.  </p>

<p>On November 9, 2011, the panel's third judge, Judge Maria do Carmo Cardoso, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/brazil-court-approves-controversial-dam-construction.php">broke the tie</a> in favor of Belo Monte. Since the dam would not be physically located on tribal lands, she saw no need for consultation with the indigenous groups. She also noted that while such consultations were "informative," they were irrelevant for congressional decisions on whether to authorize mining and hydroelectric projects on indigenous lands. The conflicting opinions of the panel, as well as the fact that the case involves a constitutional issue, all but assure that it will eventually land before the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil.</p>

<p>So, the 24-year odyssey of the Belo Monte project remains unfinished with many questions still unanswered. Opponents of the dam claim that the rule of law has been thrown under the bus in the name of a boondoggle hydro-project that offers little benefit while despoiling the Amazon, displacing native peoples and providing subsidized energy to extractive industry. Proponents argue that hydro-power remains one of the few sources of cheap, clean energy, that the benefits of the project far outweigh the costs, and that the rule of law has been scrupulously followed.</p>

<p>For my part, I feel no more comfortable opining about the dam today than I did in 2010. Back then, I even offered to sing a show tune rather than discuss it (the audience demurred...). I will say, however, that in my view, there has been far too little discussion of the wisdom of building an inefficient hydroelectric facility in an age of increasing regional water shortages brought on by climate change. The Amazon has faced worsening cycles of drought in recent years and there is every reason to believe those cycles will increase in frequency and severity. As an emerging and already powerful economy, Brazil must ensure its ability to create and deliver clean energy to meet growing demand. This dam seems unlikely to do that. Given the fragility of the affected cultures and ecosystems, the permanent costs of the project should be carefully weighed against the putative benefits. That will be true no matter what the Supreme Court decides.</p>

Wes Rist</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that the recent interest of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the impact of video games on international humanitarian law is a chance for cooperation and education with the video game industry...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/dwesrist.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>E</strong></font>veryone knows that any conversation about video games and the law is going to either revolve around discussions of intellectual property or rehashed First Amendment debates about <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-violent-video-games-ban.php">the impact of violence in video games</a>. So news that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/ihl-video-games-faq-2011-12-08.htm">took time to consider</a> what, if any, role the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Conventions</a>, the well-respected tomes of international humanitarian law, should have in the video game industry was met with confusion by many lawyers, scorn by most gamers, and probably a great amount of indifference by the general public. But as a gamer and a lawyer, and even worse, someone who actually thinks that long, detailed discussions about the rules of war are fascinating things, this news was like finding an epic loot drop. I rarely find people interested in my academic specializations of international criminal, human rights and humanitarian law, although it is a bit easier to find fellow gamers! The chance to combine the two interests, then, is not an opportunity to be ignored.</p>

<p>War games are a huge part of the video gaming industry. <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> released recently to record breaking sales. Over the lifetime of the <em>Call of Duty</em> title, Activision, the publisher of the series since the first COD title in 2003, has netted an estimated $6 billion in sales. Over 3.3 million gamers played <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> on launch day alone. And <em>Call of Duty</em> is just one of multiple war game titles in the video game pantheon.</p>

<p>So why is the ICRC paying attention to video games? Well, for one, titles like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Medal of Honor</em> and <em>Ghost Recon</em> often involve extremely realistic portrayals of violence in a conflict setting. Loosely collected under the term "shooters," these games often put players in the context of working for a military entity, either a real historical or modern military force, or a fictionalized command structure that would give the player "combatant" status under the definitions provided by the Geneva Conventions. For another, the ICRC estimated that approximately 600 million gamers worldwide are playing shooter style games. The ICC's mandate clearly includes "promoting respect for the international humanitarian law" &#8212; that large of a population segment engaging in an activity that definitely invokes elements of the laws of war is a valid target for ICRC attention.</p>

<p>The ICRC's decision to consider the question of what role the laws of war should have in video games sprang from an award-winning study on the topic by TRIAL, a Geneva-based NGO that conducted a 2009 <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Evenements_et_manifestations/Playing_by_the_Rule.pdf">study</a> [PDF] of over 20 different video games and their recognition of the rules of war in the single player campaigns. TRIAL's conclusions recognized that, as entertainment, there was no need for game designers to take note of international humanitarian law in the context of the games' mission design. They did note that some of the games penalized certain acts that run afoul of international humanitarian law norms, like indiscriminate killing of civilians, or rewarded protection of civilians. But the vast majority of the games reviewed (which, to be honest, looked like a list of many of the games on my shelf at home at that time), included explicit enticements for players to infringe on or even flaunt the laws of war. Promoting torture in interrogation settings, attacking cultural or religious buildings, and participating in extrajudicial killings were all standard fare for the list of games reviewed.</p>

<p>This is not the first time a discussion about the impact of shooter games on cultural perceptions of conflict has occurred. The 2009 movie <em>Gamer</em> featuring Gerard Butler was both a critique of the crassness of modern Internet culture, taken to extremes in the game <em>Society</em>, and a parade of horribles of the modern shooter genre in the game <em>Slayers</em>. The movie featured gamers controlling convicted criminals (via a brain implant) in life threatening combat settings designed solely for their entertainment value. It is basically bread and circuses for the digital age. At one point, Simon, the gamer controlling Butler's character, refers to the civilians being indiscriminately killed in the contest as "Kibbles 'n Bits" and Butler responds with "These are real humans!" To which, Simon replies "Death row psychos, so what? They had it coming anyway, right?" Granted, <em>Gamer</em> was itself a movie that tried to make entertainment out of violence as an example of violence used for entertainment, and it has become one of those movies that is bad enough to actually be funny. The idea of the shooter genre actually encouraging violent behavior generally has been around for a while, and the idea that it has some impact on our global understanding of international humanitarian law is not entirely far-fetched.</p>

<p>The ICRC, in its December 1, 2011 <a href="http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/meetings-and-events/international-conference1/31st-international-conference-of-red-cross-and-red-crescent/daily2/">news bulletin</a>, described the meeting as one in which "partners discussed their role and responsibility to take action against violations of [international humanitarian law] in video games." While I am a lawyer strongly in favor of improving international humanitarian law compliance, and see games as a relevant part of social discussion, I do not see any attempt to actually force game designers to abide by the laws of war as beneficial. At the end of the day, these activities are still just games. The vast majority of gamers will not be involved in situations where they are faced with the choice of whether or not to fire a rocket-propelled grenade into a civilian structure while under fire from a concealed enemy. Given the complete lack of enforcement power of international organizations to apply international humanitarian law in actual settings of armed conflict, I would have serious questions about whether or not an attempt by the ICRC to mandate international humanitarian law compliance on the part of game designers is an appropriate use of time. That is a fairly mild reaction, especially compared to the comments the Voodoo Extreme news site received when they posted the <a href="http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/63187/The-Red-Cross-Investigating-Actions-For-Gamers-Who-Break-International-Law">story</a>. My favorite has to be "lol @ international law." The ICRC makes very clear in their follow up <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/ihl-video-games-faq-2011-12-08.htm">FAQ</a> on December 8, 2011 that they know the nature of international humanitarian law has no direct application to video games, despite the journalistic hype.</p>

<p>That is not to say that there is not room here for a dialogue to occur between game designers and international humanitarian lawyers. Interactive visual media, which is all that video games really are, has been demonstrated as an effective teaching tool. I still recall the capitals of many nations thanks solely to the hours my brother and I spent chasing criminals around the globe in "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" And while attempting to bully the game industry into a righteous crusade to clean up the shooter genre is guaranteed to fail (take for example <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/controversial_fla_lawyer_is_disbarred_jack_thompson_alleges_enemies_list">Jack Thompson</a>), an actual discussion between international humanitarian lawyers and video game designers could open the doors from some interesting projects.</p>

<p>There used to be more penalties in old style shooters for killing civilians. In fact, in the deep recesses of my video game memory, I can recall several cases where killing too many civilians actually resulted in mission failure. And given the story-telling nature of the single player campaign modes in most shooter games, there certainly is room to provide discussion to the player's character in-game about the need to conduct themselves in accordance with the rules of war. Given the number of games and amount of financial support that the Activision charity Call of Duty Endowment and other video game-based charities send to veteran and active duty US military personnel, I am certain that you could find opportunities for actual US military lawyers, and even members of other nations' militaries, trained in how to comply with international humanitarian law to provide commentary on actual conflict to players. There are ways to engage both parties in this issue in interesting and rewarding ways that can accomplish both the goal of selling video games and promoting international humanitarian law.</p>

<p>The 2009 TRIAL report noted that "computer and video games are not meant to serve as didactical tools to teach the rules of war, but rather to entertain." This is why the ICRC is not, despite what some of the reports from the gaming news websites were originally alleging, attempting to apply international humanitarian law norms to gamers. Because the ICRC knows that any attempt to force video game designers to comply with these standards, a patently absurd notion for even the most novice of international scholars, will be a failure &#8212; either because it will not work and the reputation of the ICRC is damaged or because it will and people will stop playing shooter games bound by these standards. This is not a zero-sum equation, however. We do not have to accept either a world where killing civilians indiscriminately in a shooter game is not penalized or a world in which only lawyers want to play shooters. There is a middle ground. </p>

<p>The ICRC should reach out to video game developers and designers now, at the initial stages of this conversation. Gaming news website Kotaku should not be the one letting Randy Pitchford, founder of the game development studio responsible for the <em>Brothers in Arms</em> games, know about this development. If you approach anyone in any industry and tell them a bunch of people with no connection to the modern gaming community are sitting in Geneva, Switzerland deciding whether or not real world international law should apply to your video game, you are going to get a negative reaction every time. But if you reach a hand out to those same people, tell them that the leading experts on international humanitarian law want their opinions on how to best incorporate the realities of the horror of war's impact on civilians into your artistic medium, then you may just get a very different reaction. I would be willing to bet that very few game designers are going to actively dismiss the International Committee of the Red Cross when it says that it wants to have a serious discussion about the role of video games as an artistic medium and shooter games as a specific genre in the promotion of international humanitarian law. Not a lecture, not an attempt to control game designers from the outside in, but an actual conversation about how the gaming industry can contribute to making the world a better place &#8212; that may just get some different results. That could set the stage for a game that can be both entertaining and reflect the realities of conflict from someplace other than behind the trigger.</p>

<p>That is a game that I would like to play.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Dominic Hoerauf, <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/">Columbia Law School</a> Class of 2012, is a Staff Editor on the <a href="http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/">Columbia Human Rights Law Review</a>. He argues that the Obama administration's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq by December 31 is misguided as the goals embodied in the authorization for the war have not yet been achieved...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/Dominic%20Hoerauf.jpg" height='200'align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>nly a couple of weeks ago, President Barack Obama announced the full withdrawal of US troops from Iraq by December 31, 2011, putting an end to nearly nine years of <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">US military engagement</a> in which more than 4,400 US soldiers and more than 10,000 Iraqi soldiers and police force members lost their lives. One might ask, why now? Is it because the US has achieved the goals set forth in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HJ00114:">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution</a> (AUMF) and <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dda0f634.html">UN Security Council Resolution 1441</a>? What were those goals? Preventing Iraq from using weapons of mass destruction? Keeping Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction? Ousting Saddam Hussein in order to tackle possible, yet unlikely, links between al Qaeda and the then-Iraqi regime, ergo fighting terror? Stabilizing the Middle East to preserve international peace and security?</p>

<p>Admittedly, Saddam Hussein is no longer causing trouble, nor is Osama Bin Laden. Weapons of mass destruction are certainly more out of reach for the Iraqi government than they were in 2003, assuming that it even seeks to acquire weapons of mass destruction. And yet, the question arises whether the mission has been accomplished, whether this is what victory looks like? Although traditional combat action is no longer taking place, deadly bombings and shootings still occur daily, inducing a constant state of fear and terror. Just a few days ago, 43 civilians were killed in bomb attacks, increasing the number of casualties in December to 111. Is this truly what victory looks like? Is this a situation in which we would like to leave the Iraqi people on their own, abandoning a highly volatile state of affairs that could easily turn into another pre-<a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001</a> Afghanistan? Well, I guess nobody seriously thinks so. The Obama administration, of course, is well aware of that. Yet, it withdraws the troops &#8212; despite the AUMF promises to make sure that "the just demands of peace and security will be met." It is withdrawing its troops because this war was and still is costly. An incredibly sad amount of blood has been shed and an enormous sum of money has been spent. In the end, a decision to discontinue military engagement is always subject to a cost-benefit calculation. Since the benefit, not only to the US, but also to its Western allies, is not as tangible and predictable as their costs in terms of lives, money and votes, that ratio has now probably led the Obama administration to conclude that this is as good as it gets.</p>

<p>However, maybe this does not adequately take into account the very special nature of conflict this new generation of warfare presents. Other than the nation-states' wars of the twentieth century, these new wars in Afghanistan and Iraq implicate both state and non-state actors. Unlike previous wars, combat action is not confined to troops or a well-defined battlefield. As a result, the target has changed as well as the definition of victory. As can be seen in Iraq, to a remarkable extent, civilians have been the primary target of insurgent and al Qaeda attacks. In an effort to undermine the people's trust in the capacity of the new government to preserve national security, the enemy tries to induce a state of constant fear and terror. Sadly enough, as mentioned earlier, measured under this goal, they are doing quite a good job. Each day, 14 attacks kill 11 Iraqi civilians on average. Therefore, we are far from proclaiming that either the AUMF's goal of ensuring that "the just demands of peace and security" has been met or from restoring "international peace and security" to the region, as Resolution 1441 sought to do.</p>

<p>Against this background, abandoning Iraq to its fate is the wrong thing to do; it would have devastating consequences &#8212; not only for the Iraqi people, but for international peace and security in the long run. It will ultimately threaten the most apparent and legitimate goal for going to Iraq, the preservation of US national security. Again, the AUMF recognizes this potential domino effect in Section 3(a)(1). Yet, the Obama administration draws the wrong conclusions. The young and vulnerable Iraqi democracy, unfortunately, does not yet have the means to counter infiltration by terrorists and insurgents. Without foreign assistance, Iraq is bound to become another failed state, just as Afghanistan became in the 1990s, in the aftermath of its century-long civil war. In Afghanistan, decades of war left behind a severely wounded state without any effective governmental institutions. This lack of governmental infrastructure resulted in a power vacuum of lawlessness and chaos. This chaos benefitted the strongest and most ruthless actors, not the democratically legitimized statesmen. It was this particular constellation that helped the Taliban to come to power, allowing it to later provide terrorist groups with safe havens to plan and train for attacks against the West.</p>

<p>If that is not supposed to happen with Iraq, than under no circumstances should US troops leave the Iraqi people on their own. Let us not stop halfway down the road. There are achievements we should build on. Even though the democracy is struggling, at this point, at least there <em>is</em> a democracy in place. All we have to do to turn a ticking bomb into a potential model for the Middle East is stick patiently to the goals of the AUMF in order to ensure (self-)sustainability. As difficult as this may be and as long as it will take, it is worthwhile, since starting over in 10 or 15 years will be even more costly. </p>

<p>That, however, requires us to alter our perspectives on warfare. In times of asymmetric conflicts, waging war, and especially waging war successfully, which in the instant case means establishing a self-sustaining democracy capable of defending itself, is no longer only about who has the most effective military and weapons. Rather it is about protecting vulnerabilities, which is to say protecting civilians and closely coordinating the (re)building of effective institutions of good governance. It is about generating and preserving trust between the Iraqi people and their government. Yet, trust requires security, "freedom from fear," as the Preamble to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> states. In this respect, the US and its allies have failed. They have failed due to a misconception of warfare. They failed to appreciate that warfare has changed; their weapons are no longer fully up to the task given by the AUMF. Peace and security in Iraq cannot be achieved solely by shooting or detaining the enemy with state-of-the-art weapons. Trust in the domestic government necessitates strong domestic institutions. This is best achieved by peacekeeping forces with an emphasis on institution building, implementing the rule of law and advocating good governance. </p>

<p>That is not to say that we do not need the military. Quite the contrary. The military remains a crucial factor in times of asymmetric warfare, yet with slightly modified perspectives and tasks. Therefore, it should under no circumstances leave Iraq now. The soldiers are needed to provide for a secure atmosphere in which state and institution-building efforts can take place, for domestic tranquility is the precondition for sustainable development. Thus, withdrawing from Iraq at this point is the wrong call. The international community has invested too much to stop now. In order to achieve true victory in Iraq once and for all, to turn mission impossible into mission accomplished, is to modify our strategy by intensifying peacekeeping and protection efforts.</p>

		<title>Iraq Withdrawal Highlights the Need for Smart Power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.avemarialaw.edu/index.cfm?event=faculty.bio&pid=11705E7D4E0316080A64">Kevin Govern</a> of Ave Maria School of Law says that the pending withdrawal of US forces from Iraq and the challenges to maintaining security in that country and in the region requires a new strategy in dealing with the region to address security concerns amid likely cuts to the US defense budget...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/kgovern.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>S</strong></font>mart power <a href="/forum/2009/01/smart-power-and-rule-of-law.php">has been touted</a> as "a cornerstone to our new foreign policy" beginning in the Bush administration and continuing today. Smart power employs soft power tools including diplomacy, economic assistance and communications to supplement or augment traditional hard power capabilities of the military to defend and advance US interests around the world. As the mandate for US and coalition troop presence in Iraq <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">expires on December 31, 2011</a>, this concept of smart power is essential to matters of regional and international security.</p>

<p>The costs of the ongoing Global War on Terror have created a strong impetus for smart power strategies. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for an increase in smart power, advocating "to make the case for strengthening our capacity to use soft power and for better integrating it with hard power." Gates strengthened his point by comparing the State Department's annual budget of $36 billion versus 2007 military spending totaling nearly half a trillion dollars.</p>

<p>As 2011 concludes, the US Congressional Research Service has estimated that the US expended $1.283 trillion for the three operations initiated since the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">attacks of September 11, 2001</a>. These expenditures went to military operations, base security, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs and veterans' health care. Of course, there can never be a value put on the 4,486 American lives lost, or the 32,226 wounded in action.   </p>

<p>The year's end marks the end of the eighth year of military operations in Iraq. It also marks the third year under the US-Iraq <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> [PDF]. That agreement established that US combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and all US forces will be completely out of Iraq by December 31, 2011. The US and Iraqi governments also approved a Strategic Framework Agreement on mutual cooperation on primarily non-military matters.</p>

<p>The reality is that the US can no longer primarily rely upon hard power presence in Iraq, and must plan for likely withdrawals from Afghanistan and elsewhere. Instead, the policy and troop shift must manage the military presence in the region to not just rearrange military forces but to continue to develop integrated strategies (civil-military), resource bases (economic, political, and military) and tool kits (military and diplomatic capabilities) to achieve American objectives. </p>

<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki spoke November 26, 2011, at a conference in Baghdad as having "no concerns whatsoever" about security after US troops withdraw, asserting that Iraqi security forces have proven themselves capable and able to protect Iraq. So, aside from the US military and contractor presence for embassy assets in Iraq, the US will look to expand its bilateral and multilateral ties with the six nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council. The US needs to foster a new "security architecture" for the Persian Gulf in the reality of troops withdrawn from Iraq and likely defense budget cuts. Despite a likely decrease in assets assigned to the region, expanded security relationships in the region will combine economic, political and military strategies that build capability as well as demonstrate commitment to "partner capability" and "partner capacity." </p>

<p>The new year could hardly bring higher stakes to the Middle Eastern security outlook. The consequences of the so-called <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a> beyond Iraq are far from settled. The Rand Corporation <a href="http://www.rand.org/news/press/2010/03/18.html">pointed out</a> that the conflict in Iraq had in some instances entrenched and strengthened neighboring Arab governments while diminishing the momentum for political reform in those countries. Researchers also found that the Iraq War undermined al Qaeda's standing in the region and forced the network to adapt new tactics and strategies. In the Rand report estimation, no matter how the internal situation in Iraq evolves, the war's effect on the broader region will be felt for decades. </p>

<p>It appears inevitable, then, that the US initiate and implement a "smart power presence" in the region that "underscores the necessity of a strong military, but also invests heavily in alliances, partnerships and institutions at all levels to expand American influence and establish the legitimacy of American actions."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/people/full-time-faculty/haider-ala-hamoudi">Haider Ala Hamoudi</a> of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law says that although there are fears that Iraq may slide into chaos due to the impending withdrawal of troops, it is more likely that the country will continue to make slow advances in solidifying its legal and constitutional structure...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/hamoudi.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>G</strong></font>enerally speaking, the American role in both creating and maintaining order in contemporary Iraq can be exaggerated. Whatever Iraq's current problems, and they are quite considerable, levels of intercommunal violence are lower than they were at the height of the <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war">American intervention</a>, and the role of the state in maintaining basic order on the streets is greater than it was in 2004 and 2005, even with the contribution of American troops at that time. If that is so for general, public order, it is dramatically more the case for constitutional and legal order. Iraq's legal and constitutional architecture has been built and developed largely by Iraqis, with modest American support coming from hardworking and well meaning advisors who were, by their own admission, limited by an unfamiliarity with the legal system they were supposed to be advising. The idea of a constitutional state whose constitution was drafted by Americans and where public order was being maintained by American troops may have been an appealing narrative to some, but it is one dramatically at odds with the facts. It is for this reason that the idea of an immediate backslide into chaos and disorder upon full American withdrawal seems somewhat difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>Yet the US continued to have one important role in Iraq from 2003 until now, and the presence of its troops tended to support that role in many ways. This related to mediation of existing disputes among Iraq's three central identitarian groups &#8212; the Sunnis, the Shia and the Kurds. Thus, for example, the Americans neither drafted nor enacted key amendments to the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/iraq-parliament-approves-new-election.php">Election Law of 2009</a> that made Iraq's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iraq-supreme-court-ratifies-march-election-results.php">parliamentary elections of 2010</a> possible. The Iraqis proved themselves capable of drafting legislation that was messy but worked, and in using their own parliamentary procedures to enact it. In fact, greater outside technical support to make a better legislative product may have proven itself quite damaging, as a means to delegitimize the legislation and drain domestic enthusiasm for it. </p>

<p>The greatest US contribution, however, and the element without which success might have been difficult to achieve, was in acting as the final mediator among the competing groups. Of course the groups negotiated among themselves as well, and could reach pacts with or without American support, but the presence of the US, and its interest in seeing consensual legislation passed, proved vital in facilitating dialogue and the levels of compromise necessary to get the law through the parliament. The presence of US troops was not directly relevant to the mediation role in that instance, but plainly the American investment in Iraq, and its ability to use force in other contexts, certainly made its mediatory role more powerful as a general matter.</p>

<p>As American troops withdraw from Iraq, and as American interest in Iraq wanes, it is the relative weakening of this position as mediator that is the most troubling. This is particularly because, as the history of the US shows, divisive legal and constitutional disputes are hardly solved by language in legal text. Rather, such disputes are continually managed through negotiation, electoral competition and dialogue. As concerns legislation, new laws are often passed, and as for constitutional disputes, new readings of expansive constitutional text are developed that bring forth continually evolving forms of constitutional order. It is vitally important that this evolution is managed in a manner that does not cast doubt on the legitimacy of the state's authority by any identitarian group, or a slow and eventual disintegration of the state is at least possible. </p>

<p>Thus, for example, the Iraq constitution contains language that both enhances the role of Islam in the state through requiring that all legislation enacted not be contradictory to Islam's "settled rulings," and ensures the same panoply of constitutional rights and freedoms that exist in constitutions throughout the world. There are obviously many constructions of this deliberately expansive and broad language that could be deemed consistent with its text, and the matter is debated extensively within Iraqi society. Secularists like Iyad Allawi suggest that Islam is more of a spiritual ethos that pervades the social order and legislation need only be in basic harmony with that general ethos, while Islamists like Muqtada al Sadr seem to envision something considerably more stringent. No single reading is likely to become dominant at least in the near to medium term, and the matter will ebb and flow over time, precisely as interpretations of constitutional text has in the US. There is nothing wrong with this, in fact, if constitutional longevity is a goal of any state, then such competition and evolution over constitutional meaning is inevitable. Yet it requires dialogue and compromise, particularly in a divided state, so that one view is not imposed against the will of a recalcitrant identitarian group, which might then deem the entire state project entirely illegitimate.</p>

<p>As concerns Islam and the state, despite the outsized media attention given them, the Iraqis seem quite capable of handling them without the help of outside powers who inevitably fail to appreciate the nature of the divides. Yet as to federalism, the matter is far from clear. Certainly repeated and continuous dialogue managed by the US helped to bring Sunnis into the constitutional dialogue, to such an extent that a community that once regarded the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF] as being the essence of imposition never makes such a claim anymore. In fact, the Sunni parliamentary speaker very recently spoke favorably of the very federalist provisions to which his Sunni predecessors took such strong exception. Whether or not such dialogue to reach consensual solutions can continue without the US in its key mediatory role is a matter of some question, and given the extent of division in Iraqi society over any number of topics, ranging from <a href="/forum/2009/11/kirkuk-danger-of-delay.php">Kirkuk</a> to the management of oil fields, this is of deep concern.</p>

<p>In the end, as a cautious optimist, and taking into account significant advances from 2005 forward, I think the state is likely to continue to advance in the slow, plodding manner that it has, and that the type of cataclysmic violence that existed in 2004 and 2005 is a thing of the past. Still, I would have been more comfortable had there been a way for the US to prolong its presence and its substantial investments longer so that we could be more certain of this.</p>

		<title>Petitioner Privacy Rights Lost Amid Marriage Equality Fight</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.ij.org/staff/608-senior-attorney?task=view">Steve Simpson</a>, a senior attorney at the <a href="http://ij.org/">Institute for Justice</a>, says that recent decisions releasing the names of those who signed a petition to place domestic partnership laws on the ballot in Washington state lack a proper examination of the facts of the case and fail protect petitioners' right to privacy...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/stevesimpson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/appeals-court-allows-release-of-referendum-71-petition-names.php">issued a decision</a> in <em>Doe v. Reed</em> that probably signals the end of the plaintiffs' efforts to protect the identities of those who signed petitions supporting Referendum 71, an anti-domestic partnership measure in Washington state. The decision is a disappointing end to a case that is more noteworthy for the controversy surrounding the underlying issue, same-sex marriage, than for the rule of law regarding petitioners' privacy established in any of the decisions in the case. Perhaps more than anything, the various decisions in the case illustrate a triumph of legal formalism over engaged, fact-based judging.</p>

                <p>When the case was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-release-of-names-on-petition-does-not-violate-free-speech.php">decided by the Supreme Court</a>, the issue in <em>Doe</em> was whether the First Amendment prevented Washington state from publicly disclosing the identities of those who signed petitions to place Referendum 71 on the ballot. On the heels of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-proposition-8-issues.php">battle over Proposition 8</a> in California, the plaintiff in <em>Doe</em> was concerned that if the signatures were released, those who supported placing the referendum on the ballot would suffer harassment and intimidation. The Court addressed the issue narrowly, construing the challenge as a facial attack on the state's authority to require the disclosure of petition signatures at all. Applying precedents that established the state's wide latitude to prevent fraud in elections, the Supreme Court concluded that disclosing the petitions was a legitimate means of verifying signatures. Disclosure in this context, according to the Court, would allow members of the public to essentially verify the state's verification, and thus help identify any invalid signatures.</p>

                <p>There may have been some sense to the Court's position if we lived at a time when election officials laboriously pored over long lists of petition signatures by hand. However, as Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out in dissent, in the modern era, this sort of thing is typically done by computer. Indeed, by the time the case reached the high court, the state had performed its normal verification process with little difficulty. The groups that sought the petition signatures did not seem interested in verifying signatures after the fact. In fact, two of them intended to post signers' identities on the Internet so others could confront them about their views on same-sex marriage. Justice Thomas thus rejected the majority's rationale for disclosure, and would have struck down the law allowing public disclosure as a violation of the right to free speech and association.</p>

                <p>Despite all this, the Court held that the plaintiffs could still assert an as-applied challenge to disclosure on remand. When the case returned to the district court, the question was whether the plaintiffs could show that the threat of harassment or reprisals to them was sufficient to outweigh the government's interest in disclosure. The district court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17705011216684834287">concluded that disclosure</a> was constitutional, despite the fact that Referendum 71 had gone down to defeat months earlier. </p>

                <p>The state <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-releases-names-on-washington-domestic-partnership-petition.php">made the petitions public</a>, and the plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit seeking an injunction protecting the petitions from further disclosure. The Ninth Circuit denied the injunction on the grounds that it was likely moot because the signatures had already been disclosed. Judge Smith dissented from the panel's decision, arguing that the issue was likely not moot because there was no evidence that anyone had reviewed the petitions and identified individual names or could do so. Judge Smith also pointed out that there was no hurry to disclose the petitions or harm to the state from preventing disclosure, so the court could easily have granted the injunction while it decided the appeal. Ironically, argued Judge Smith, if the issue was not moot, the court's own decision denying the injunction would make it so by virtually ensuring that the identities of petition signers would be distributed far and wide.  </p>

                <p>In summary, the Supreme Court upheld public disclosure of petition signatures so the state could verify signatures when it already had an adequate means for doing so without public disclosure, and no one seemed to want the signatures for that purpose. The district court then denied an as-applied challenge to disclosure after the point at which verification of signatures could do any good, because the election was over. The Ninth Circuit capped off a triumvirate of questionable decisions by concluding an injunction after disclosure was moot and ensuring that if it was not, it surely would be soon because of the court's own refusal to reverse that disclosure.<br />
                    <br />
                    Regardless of one's views on same-sex marriage, the issue of publicly disclosing petition signatures in ballot issue elections deserves better treatment than it received in this case. It is perfectly appropriate for individuals involved in a political battle to confront and criticize their opponents, but it is equally appropriate for their opponents to guard their privacy. Indeed, it is inconsistent to protect the right to vote anonymously, on the one hand, and yet to compel disclosure of one's views on the same issue by allowing the signatures of those who sign petitions to be made public, on the other. As Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissent, states can verify signatures without publicly disclosing them, so disclosure served no valid state interest in this case and could only lead to chilling speech and political participation.  </p>

                <p>The Constitution was intended to allow the government to function on a practical level, for instance by establishing sensible rules for elections, without trampling individual rights. To properly interpret and apply its provisions, courts must look at both sides of that equation seriously.</p>

He argues that an interstate compact altering presidential elections missed a unique opportunity to partially remedy the denial of federal voting rights to the four million US citizens living in the territories... <em>(His opinions are not intended to represent those of JURIST)</em><hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/dwyerarce.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>I</strong></font>n August, California became one of a handful of states to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/california-governor-signs-law-awarding-all-of-states-electoral-votes-to-popular-vote-winner--.php">adopt an interstate compact</a> that would make the nationwide popular vote controlling in presidential elections. Article II of the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">Constitution</a> provides that the President and Vice President are elected by the Electoral College, a body of electors apportioned to each state according to the size of its congressional delegation. This has resulted in the current total of 538 Electoral College votes, representing 100 senators, 435 representatives, plus three more awarded from the District of Columbia, as provided by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxiii">Twenty-Third Amendment</a>. The Constitution provides that these electors shall be appointed by a state's legislature, which has discretion in determining which presidential candidate will receive the state's votes. Despite this grant of power, the states have uniformly provided that their Electoral College slate be awarded to the winner of the popular vote in that state.<br />
 <br />
The <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/misc/888wordcompact.php">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a> would change the nature of the election by pledging a member-state's Electoral College votes to the winner of the nationwide popular vote, regardless of which candidate wins in the statewide vote. In calculating the national popular vote, the compact requires that states take into account the popular vote in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as certified and reported by state election officials. A trigger provision prevents the compact from coming into force until enough states adopt it to comprise a majority of the Electoral College, 270 votes. With California's adoption of the compact, there are now 132 Electoral College votes tied to it, with over a dozen more state legislatures considering joining the compact. Once it has been adopted by enough states, the Electoral College will be effectively abolished, allowing the winner of the national popular vote to become President. This would avoid the situations occurring in 1876, 1888 and 2000, when the presidential candidate who lost the national popular vote ascended to the presidency with an Electoral College majority alone. One detrimental aspect of the Electoral College which is not remedied through this compact is the disenfranchisement of just over four million US citizens who are currently excluded from voting in federal elections: the residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. (The residents of a fifth territory, American Samoa, are excluded from this analysis because they are not US citizens).</p>

<p>Puerto Rico and Guam have been part of the US since they were ceded by Spain in 1898. The US Virgin Islands were acquired from Denmark in 1917, and the Northern Mariana Islands came under US control at the conclusion of World War II. Congress granted US citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico in 1917, those of the US Virgin Islands in 1927, Guam in 1950, and the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986. Each territory elects a Delegate to the US House of Representatives who can vote in committee but cannot vote on the final disposition of legislation, and each hosts a federal district court. These US citizens, living on US soil under constitutional governments organized through the authority of Congress, are excluded from the federal franchise solely due to their geographic location outside of one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia. This geographic discrimination is embodied in the text of the Constitution itself, which provides that voting representatives be elected to the House "by the people of the several states," that the Senate shall be "composed of two Senators from each state, elected by the people thereof," and that the president shall be elected through the state dominated Electoral College process. This federal framework fails to take into account the existence of seemingly permanent US territories populated by US citizens and, as such, excludes them from effective participation in the national body politic.<br />
 <br />
US citizens living in Puerto Rico and Guam have sued on several occasions to gain inclusion in the presidential vote. In 1984, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected one such claim in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12893543721111307809">Attorney General of the Territory of Guam v. United States</a>, holding that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This was because the<blockquote>Constitution does not grant to American citizens the right to elect the President ... Electors appointed by the states elect the President and Vice President. ... Thus, citizens do not vote for the President. Electors, appointed by "each State," vote for the President.</blockquote>Similarly, following a long line of cases seeking federal voting rights for US citizens in Puerto Rico, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled <em>en banc</em> in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16075684064475575353">Igart&#250;a-De La Rosa v. United States</a> that<blockquote>Voting for President and Vice President of the United States is governed neither by rhetoric nor intuitive values but by a provision of the Constitution. This provision does not confer the franchise on "U.S. citizens" but on "Electors" who are to be "appoint[ed]" by each "State," in "such Manner" as the state legislature may direct, equal to the number of Senators and Representatives to whom the state is entitled.</blockquote> The rulings by federal appellate courts have been uniform on this issue: US citizens living in one of these territories cannot exercise the federal franchise unless they relocate to a state or the District of Columbia, the territory in which they live becomes a state, or the Constitution is amended to allow federal voting rights in the territories. Despite the steadfast dissent of Judge Juan Torruella on the First Circuit, the findings of a few overturned district court opinions, and the writings of academic observers lamenting the colonial nature of the situation, this constitutional analysis would appear to be correct both textually and historically.<br />
 <br />
There is now one other option available for enfranchising these four million Americans: the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact could have provided for the inclusion of the votes cast for president in these four territories in the national vote count that would determine the outcome of the presidential election. Since the decision on whether or not to include these votes would still be entirely within the competence of the state legislature in awarding its Electoral College votes, the inability of territorial residents to vote for president in their own right would become irrelevant.<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately, this language was not included in the compact. Given the likely controversy that would ensue by attempting to include these territories in the vote totals &#8212; some of which was seen during the debate over the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-us-house-passes-bill-on-puerto-rico-status-referendum.php">Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2010</a> &#8212; a compact including this language would have faced significant hurdles.<br />
 <br />
The people of Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands have been Americans for generations. They are US citizens by birth, have been drafted, pay a number of federal taxes, and are subject to most federal legislation. Unlike states, the territories are not sovereign, but instead are subject to the plenary powers of a Congress they have no voting representation in and an Executive Branch they do not participate in electing. Despite the enormous impact federal action has on them, the residents of these territories are excluded from participating in one of the most fundamental exercises of American democracy. It is a shame that a unique opportunity to partially alleviate this fundamental injustice has been squandered.  <br />
 <br />
Well, at least they all get their own <a href="http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/DCAndTerritories/">quarters</a>.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/phil-robertson">Phil Robertson</a>, Deputy Director of the Asia Division at <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>, says that the Peaceful Assembly Bill is a betrayal of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's earlier promises to bolster civil society through broadening respect for individual rights and enhancing democratic practices...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/philrobertson.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>N</strong></font>o one has ever accused Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of rhetorical reticence, especially when the political spotlight is shining intensely. The leader who coined the "1Malaysia" campaign, which has done surprisingly little to ease the concerns of the country's non-Malay minorities despite its snappy logo and full government backing, has now turned his attention to political reform.  </p>

                <p>In his <a href="http://www.theedgemalaysia.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=193046&Itemid=27">Malaysia Day speech</a> on September 15, Najib proclaimed that "The Malaysia which we dream of and one that we are currently building is the Malaysia which practices functional and inclusive democracy, where peace and public order are safeguarded in line with the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law and respect for basic human rights and individual rights." While activists held out hope for real reform, many political commentators viewed this as the opening salvo for possible early elections in 2012, which will be hotly contested between the government and a political opposition that made historic gains in the last election, held in 2008.  </p>

                <p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">reform effort started</a> with the October repeal of the two infrequently used restrictive laws, the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20377.pdf">Restricted Residence Act</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2079.pdf">Banishment Act</a> [PDF]. Pledges were also made to do away with infamous preventive detention laws like the <a href="http://www.anfrel.org/mission_data/ISA%20-%20Malaysia.pdf">Internal Security Act</a> [PDF], to rescind emergency proclamations underpinning the Emergency Ordinance that permit detention for up to two years to protect public order, and easing restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression.  </p>

                <p>The promises included a review of Section 27 of the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Act%20344.pdf">Police Act 1967</a> [PDF], which empowers the police "to regulate assemblies, meetings and processions" by requiring police permits. Najib stated that the review would take "into consideration Article 10 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/malaysia.pdf">Federation Constitution</a> [PDF] but with a principle that is strongly against street demonstrations." Nevertheless, he said, "the approval to assemble will be given ... after taking into consideration international norms." Optimists said so far, so good, since Article 10 clearly establishes the rights to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly and association.  </p>

                <p>Fast forward two months and Najib's bold promises lie in tatters, largely discredited by the draconian Public Assembly Bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/malaysia-lawmakers-advance-ban-on-street-protests.php">rushed through the lower house of Parliament</a> on November 29. Demands by the Malaysian Bar Council and other leading civil society groups for continuing consultations were ignored. Malaysia's Senate will probably consider the bill soon and there is little hope that it will seriously reconsider the broader implications of the measure on fundamental freedoms in a country where such freedoms have long been trampled upon.</p>

                <p>The draft law is a cruel joke on Malaysian civil society, which was hoping for genuine reforms. In a classic case of bait and switch, the bill does away with the formal need for a police permit but sets out a blanket ban on "assemblies in motion" &#8212; such as marches and street protests &#8212; and provides such wide discretion for police to prescribe unilaterally the conditions and circumstances for public assemblies that it ensures the right to assemble will be even more tightly restricted. </p>

                <p>General principles of international human rights law provide that restrictions on peaceful assemblies must not only must be necessary for public order, but also proportionate to the circumstances. The requirement cannot be met by a wholesale ban, but requires a case-by-case analysis. The bill fails that test and is significantly more restrictive than the law it replaces.  </p>

                <p>In addition to the outright ban on marches, the <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/files/billindex/pdf/2011/DR422011E.pdf">Peaceful Assembly Bill</a> gives district police chiefs broad discretionary powers to set the terms of any assembly, including establishing a balance between the interests of the assemblers and those who might be affected by the event and "any other matter ... necessary or expedient." Police may also use "all reasonable force" in dispersing an assembly, yet nowhere in the draft law is the term "reasonable" defined or specification made in what types of situations force would be considered legitimate.  </p>

                <p>The draft law also sets out that no one under age 21 may organize a protest. Those under 15 are even barred from taking part, silencing young voices and violating the right to participation under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, one of the few human rights treaties Malaysia has ratified.  </p>

                <p>Exploitative employers of the literally millions of foreign migrant workers in Malaysia can also breathe a sigh of relief since the law bars non-Malaysian citizens from organizing or participating in an assembly. If that were not enough, the bill includes an escape clause for the government to ensure quiescence by providing the home affairs minister unilateral power to give the thumbs up or down on an assembly &#8212; a decision that should be reserved for the courts.</p>

                <p>The draft law further prohibits assemblies at or within 50 meters (164 feet) of anywhere designated "a prohibited place." Prohibited places explicitly include gas stations, hospitals, fire stations, airports, railways, land public transport terminals on public land, ports, canals, docks, wharves, piers, bridges, marinas, places of worship, kindergartens and schools, dams, reservoirs and water catchments areas, water treatment plants and electricity stations. Try to find a spot within a modern city that is not within 50 meters of one of these places and it becomes clear that the intent is to make it virtually impossible to stage a protest in an urban area in Malaysia.    </p>

                <p>Evidently the Malaysian government has not learned that all-out attempts to stop citizen-organized marches can backfire badly. On July 9, the government was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-says-malaysia-used-heavy-handed-response-to-protests.php">roundly condemned abroad</a> for cracking down on a march in Kuala Lumpur by Bersih 2.0, a coalition of 62 organizations calling for clean and fair elections. Despite a ban on the march and a barrage of police warnings and threats of arrests, tens of thousands peacefully marched in the face of police tear gas and water cannons. The police arrested 1,667 people, at times using unnecessary force. Media accounts, supplemented by the rapid spread of private video and audio recordings through social media like Facebook, effectively discredited the police version of events. Perhaps recognizing that it cannot control or monopolize the images and messages coming out of such protests, the government has evidently now decided to prevent people from demonstrating in the first place.  </p>

                <p>Malaysian officials claim they have borrowed legal models for the Peaceful Assembly Bill from democratic countries, but clearly respect for the right of peaceful assembly was left out of the mix. Najib said on September 15 that it is time to rescind the three emergency ordinances on the books and "forge ahead with a new paradigm based on new hope and not be constrained by nostalgia for the past." He added the time was ripe for this move because the government was "realizing the changing realities, taking the pulse of the nation and feeling the restlessness of the people aspiring for a more open Malaysia with a dynamic democracy where the views, ideas and concerns of the masses are given greater attention so that our system would be comparable to the other democracies of the world that are based on the philosophy 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.'" So  why then is he promoting a Peaceful Assembly Bill that sets out a new set of draconian restrictions on core human rights?   </p>

                <p>When he made his Malaysia Day speech, the prime minister drew the kind of global attention that Malaysia so rarely receives, accompanied by hope that his words would mark the start of long overdue, serious and significant legal reforms to broaden respect for rights and deepen democratic practices, yet with the world still watching, he has now stepped away from his pledges.  </p>

                <p>Najib should heed the call of the Malaysian Bar Council, pull the bill back, and send it to a Parliamentary Select Committee where all stakeholders can have their say and a better bill can be crafted. It is not too late for the government to reverse course, recognizing that bringing the existing draft of the Peaceful Assembly Bill into law will constitute a betrayal of the prime minister's lofty words.  </p>

Millender</em>, argues that the police violated clearly established gun ownership rights in seizing the guns of all those present within the searched premises without verifying that the suspect was among those persons...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/stephenhalbrook.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>n <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-drug-patents-search-warrants.php">Messerschmidt v. Millender</a>, the victim of an assault gave the police photographs of the assailant and the black shotgun with a pistol grip he used in the assault. She also said that the assailant "might" be hiding at the house of Augusta Millender, who had been his foster mother years before. Police obtained a general warrant to seize all firearms from the Millender residence, claiming to the magistrate that the assailant actually lived there and not relating that 10 people resided in the house. </p>

                <p>An <em>amici curie</em> brief was filed by the National Rifle Association and the California Rifle and Pistol Foundation arguing that the warrant and search violated clearly established rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt2_user.html">Second Amendment</a>, which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms, as well as the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4toc_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a>, which requires probable cause to seize things that must be particularly described.</p>

                <p>When the search took place in 2003, it was clearly established that possession of firearms by residents of a house gave rise to no enhanced probable cause that would loosen the particularity requirement. No "automatic firearm exception" exists to the Fourth Amendment; a prior case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14210739454984113735">Florida v. JL</a>, the US Supreme Court had already held warrantless searches to be unlawful in such a situation.</p>

                <p>An even earlier case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9070596919144743522">Staples v. United States</a>, the Court held that authorization to seize all firearms flies in the face of the fact that "owning a gun is usually licit and blameless conduct. Roughly 50 percent of American homes contain at least one firearm of some sort."</p>

                <p>The warrant here authorized a night search, similar to typical no-knock warrants. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7584548860667618761">Gould v. Davis</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected a qualified-immunity defense for obtaining a no-knock warrant based on the mere presence of firearms in a house &#8212; "If the officers are correct, then the knock and announcement requirement would never apply in the search of anyone's home who legally owned a firearm. This clearly was not and is not the law, and no reasonable officer could have believed it to be so."</p>

                <p>In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9163764359425952548">United States v. Bates</a>, US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that "[e]vidence that firearms are within a residence, by itself, is not sufficient to create an exigency to officers when executing a warrant." More recently, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12154166306842226934">Bellotte v. Edwards</a>, the Fourth Circuit rejected qualified immunity regarding a no-knock warrant based on the residents of a house having permits to carry concealed firearms. "It should go without saying that carrying a concealed weapon pursuant to a valid concealed carry permit is a lawful act." The court further noted that the officers admitted that "most people in West Virginia have guns."</p>

                <p>In obtaining the warrant in <em>Millender</em> to seize all firearms in what they knew to be Millender's residence and other non-suspects, and without taking reasonable steps to verify that the suspect might actually be there, the officers violated clearly-established rights.</p>

                <p>The Second Amendment provides that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> invalidated a handgun ban with the explanation: "[T]he inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right. The handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of 'arms' that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose. The prohibition extends, moreover, to the home, where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute."</p>

                <p>General warrants are to be particularly condemned regarding constitutionally-protected property, mere possession of which cannot give rise to probable cause to search. As the Supreme Court explained in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4415481225642593103">Zurcher v. Stanford Daily</a>: "Where presumptively protected materials are sought to be seized, the warrant requirement should be administered to leave as little as possible to the discretion or whim of the officer in the field." As applied in that case, this meant: "Where the materials sought to be seized may be protected by the First Amendment, the requirements of the Fourth Amendment must be applied with 'scrupulous exactitude.'"</p>

                <p>Given that "the constitutional requirement that warrants must particularly describe the 'things to be seized' is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the 'things' are books," <em>Stanford</em> held it to be an invalid general warrant. In so doing, the Court noted that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1afrag1_user.html">First</a>, Fourth and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5afrag1_user.html">Fifth</a> Amendments are "closely related, safeguarding not only privacy and protection against self-incrimination but 'conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression as well.'"  </p>

                <p>A similar statement could be made about the First, Second and Fourth Amendments, in that the <em>Heller</em> Court explained: "it has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right."</p>

                <p>Given that the search here took place before this Court's 2008 decision in <em>Heller</em>, petitioners might suggest that the right to keep and bear arms, with attendant restrictions on search warrants, would be clearly established only in post-<em>Heller</em> cases. This would ignore the clear text of the Second Amendment as well as prior decisions of the Court recognizing the rights therein. See, for example, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10167007390100843851">United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez</a>, holding that "'the people' protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, ... refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community," and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a>, which refers to "the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution [such as] ... the right to keep and bear arms." </p>

                <p>Even without any constitutional recognition, lawful firearms are and have always been widely possessed in American homes, rendering a general warrant to seize all of them from all residents, none of which was a suspect in anything, violative of clearly established rights.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://pages.citebite.com/o1d3r1s2u4aoi">Damian Ugwu</a>, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.justiceadvocates.org/">Social Justice &amp; Advocacy Initiative</a>, says that the recent bill prohibiting same-sex marriage in Nigeria has ominous implications for a broad range of individual rights in the country...<br><hr height="1"><br><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/hotline/damianugwu1.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>n November 29, 2011, the Nigerian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nigeria-senate-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">unanimously passed a bill</a> prohibiting same-sex marriage and further criminalizing homosexuality. The legislation, "<a href="http://www.nassnig.org/nass/legislation2.php?search=SB.05&Submit=Search">A Bill for an Act To Prohibit Marriage or Civil Union Entered Into Between Persons Of Same Sex, Solemnization of Same and For Other Matter Related Therewith</a>," was first introduced by Senator Domingo Banda and 24 others and went through a public hearing organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Health and Human Rights. It is expected that the bill will go through the House of Representatives and will be sent to the President for final accent and passage into law. Against the background of worldwide indignation from groups, governments and the public debate ignited by the bill, this short article looks at the bill and tries to explain its implications for individual liberties and human rights in Nigeria.</p>

                <p>The Same-Sex Marriage Bill is divided into 8 sections:<br />
                    <br />
                    Section 1 prohibits marriage between same-sex persons in Nigeria. Section 1(3) voids any marriage between persons of the same sex entered into in other countries and deprives such couples the recognition or entitlement to the benefits of a valid marriage. It also makes any contractual or other rights accruing as a result of any same-sex marriage unenforceable in any court in Nigeria. </p>

                <p>Section 2 prohibits the celebration of same-sex marriage at religious centers and the issuance of marriage licenses to parties of the same sex.</p>

                <p>Section 4 prohibits the registration of gay clubs and societies in all institutions and publicity of same-sex sexual relationships. The section further prohibits publicity, procession and public show of a same-sex amorous relationship. </p>

                <p>Section 5 creates the offenses and penalties for holding same sex-marriages, or for performing, witnessing or aiding or abetting the ceremony of same-sex marriages. Engaging in same-sex marriage is punishable by 14 years imprisonment, while the crime of participating in gay organizations, public show of amorous same-sex relationship, witnessing and abetting the solemnization of same-sex marriage, registering or supporting the registration and operation of gay clubs, societies and organizations in Nigeria attracts a penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</p>

                <p>Section 6 confers the jurisdiction to entertain all matters, cases and proceedings arising from same-sex marriages or relationships on the High Court in the states and the Federal Capital Territory.</p>

                <p>While introducing the bill at the floor of the Senate, Banda cited the need to curb and protect Nigerians from destructive and foreign moral influence. Same-sex marriage is currently not legal in Nigeria, as Nigerian law recognizes three classes of marriage: Christian or statutory, customary and Islamic. None of these systems of matrimonial law countenances marriages between persons of the same sex. Additionally, Nigerian law already criminalizes homosexual conduct, making it even harder to justify the introduction of the present bill. This is evidenced in the provisions of the penal code law applicable in all the states in Northern Nigeria and the criminal code laws of all the states in Southern Nigeria. For example, see Section 284 of the penal code law and Sections 214, 217 and 227 of the <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-Tables.htm">criminal code law</a>. The Sharia law, widely practiced in most parts of Northern Nigeria, provides for sentences including the death penalty for homosexual offenses. See for example Chapter III "Hudud and Hudud related offences," Part law III, Sodomy (Liwat)," Section 128-129 of the Kano State Sharia Penal Code Law 2000. The criminal code law and the penal code law have been in force since 1945 and 1968 respectively, while the Sharia codes have been in force for about 10 years in most parts of Northern Nigeria. This again brings into question the rationale for the new law, especially since no person or group has ever raised the issue of their desire to engage in same-sex marriage.</p>

                <p>It will be inappropriate to attempt any discussion of this bill without addressing some of the religious and cultural concerns of its promoters. It is instructive to note that the proponents of the bill said that homosexuality is "un-African," yet they turn to Christianity, a religion that is not African, and is indeed opposed to several African traditions, to explain their point. Further, Nigerian jurisprudence has a long history of separating the institution of religion from the law. Aside from these points, it must also be pointed out that this bill has grave implications for individual rights of the people and democracy in Nigeria.</p>

                <p>The bill would have a devastating effect on a range of civil society organizations in Nigeria while inciting hatred and violence against anyone suspected of practicing or supporting same-sex relationships, including but not limited to LGBT persons and activists. It is frightening in its possibilities for doing great damage to the fundamental rights of citizens. The provisions of the bill are in clear violation of the <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Nigerian Constitution</a> and international instruments to which Nigeria is a state party.</p>

                <p>Provisions in the bill violate Sections 37, 38, 40 and 42 of Nigeria's Constitution, and the analogous provisions of the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/charter_en.html">African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> (Articles 2, 3, 11 and 28) and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) (Articles 2, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 26). The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, guarantees certain fundamental rights to all citizens in Chapter IV. Section 34 guarantees the right to the dignity of the human person. Section 34 expressly forbids discrimination on the ground of sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national and social origin, fortune, birth or other status.</p>

                <p>Although the UN Human Rights Committee established in <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/undocs/902-1999.html">Joslin V. New Zealand</a> that the ICCPR does not recognize a fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples under Article 23(2), in <a href="http://www.bayefsky.com/html/australia_t5_iccpr_941_2000.php">Young v. Australia</a> the committee did recognize that differential treatment between unmarried same-sex and different-sex couples may constitute a breach of state party obligations under the prohibition of discrimination in Article 26.</p>

                <p>Section 5(3) of the bill, which attempts to criminalize anybody who "witness, aids or abets the solemnization of same sex union," is very problematic as it introduces widespread censorship and undermines fundamental freedoms such as speech, expression, association and assembly.</p>

                <p>The bill is clearly discriminatory as it singles out one group of people to be deprived of rights that all people enjoy as guaranteed by the constitution and international human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party. In particular, the bill violates the right to freedom from discrimination as recognized in Section 42(1) of the Nigerian Constitution.</p>

                <p>The potential political implications are equally enormous. Opposition politicians and activists can simply be labeled as homosexuals to ensure that they are discredited. A case in point was in January 2011, during the presidential primaries of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Opponents of former vice president Alhaji Atiku Abubakar assembled a group of young men under the banner of "Nigerian Gay Forum," purportedly seeking voter support for Atiku, because "he is one of us." </p>

                <p>The provisions of the bill are vague in their most dangerous places and the enforcement of the law is left to the subjective opinion of the enforcers. The provisions of Section 5(2), for instance, prohibit publicity, procession and public shows of gay relationships. The danger in this provision is that it is a license for the enforcers of the law to determine what amounts to a public show of an amorous relationship.</p>

                <p>That UN Human Rights Committee has consistently argued that any domestic law criminalizing private, same-sex behavior between consenting adults is a violation of the principle of non-discrimination. See, for instance, the observations delivered with reference to Egypt in 2002, Ecuador in 1998, and the US in 1995 and 2006. It should be noted that Nigeria acceded to the ICCPR without reservations in 1993. On the authority of <a href="http://www.bayefsky.com/html/103_australia118.php">Toonen v. Australia</a>, the committee made far-reaching pronouncements on the issue of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and held that states cannot curtail human rights on the basis of sexual orientation. The same-sex marriage bill is a clear negation of duty of the Nigerian state, which is a state party to the ICCPR and other international instruments prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>

                <p>Section 45 of the Nigerian Constitution has placed restrictions on some of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Sections 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41, in the interest of defense, public safety, public order, public morality or public health; or for the purpose of protecting the rights and freedoms of other persons. It is worthy to note that the right to freedom from discrimination is not included in the restrictions. Even if Section 42 had been included, the bill would still not have been covered, as it would have been against the interest of public health and the behavior being criminalized cannot be said to infringe on the rights of others. Public morality cannot also be in issue with respect to consensual relationship in private. </p>

                <p>The Nigerian Constitution equally guarantees the right to privacy and family life in Section 37. This right is to protect the privacy of the citizen at home as well as his correspondence; Section 5(3) of this bill is a clear violation of this right. Under the guise of enforcing this law, the state can violate the citizen's right to privacy with impunity. </p>

                <p>If passed into law, the bill will amount to an incitement to persecute persons on the basis of their sexual orientation. Article 7 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> prohibits any incitements to discrimination; the present bill will act as a license for torture and ill treatment based on sexual orientation. By institutionalizing discrimination, the law will act as an official incitement to violence against lesbians and gay men in the community as a whole, whether in custody, in prison, on the street or in the home. Additionally, the bill will deprive gays and lesbians the right to life by obstructing access to HIV/AIDS programs, as it is capable of driving people already suffering stigma for their sexual identity still further underground. Clearly it is wrong to prevent persons from accessing medical facilities on the basis of their sexual orientation. If it becomes impossible under the legal regime for the gay community to access medical facilities, or if they cannot be beneficiaries of the HIV prevention and campaign efforts, this amounts to a violation of the right to life guaranteed under Section 33 of the Constitution.</p>

                <p>The bill will also open avenues for human rights violations by the Nigerian police even among heterosexual individuals, including thousands of migrant workers and students who share rooms in major Nigerian cities for economic reasons. In the wake of a similar bill in 2007, security men forced their way into a party and arrested 18 young men in August 2007 in Bauchi, Northern Nigeria. They were later charged with organizing gay marriages. Also expected to increase is the practice of police and vigilantes breaking into hotel rooms, seeking out gay couples.</p>

                <p>This discourse merely attempts to highlight the dangers of the bill and its implication for Nigeria's democratic process. The same-sex marriage bill is offensive, discriminatory and a violation of ICCPR and the <a href="http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/">Yogyakarta Principles</a>, among other human rights treaties. Above all, the Nigerian government needs to rise up to fulfill its fundamental obligations and responsibilities to its entire citizenry and to overturn this colossal human rights violation, and protect the rights and dignity of all, including sexual minorities.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://chaselaw.nku.edu/faculty/faculty_bio.php?id=89">John Bickers</a> of Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law says that changes in the past decade have made the use of military commissions in the fight against al Qaeda both unnecessary and politically detrimental for the US, and argues that they should be abandoned in favor of the federal judiciary...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/johnbickers1.jpeg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>L</strong></font>ast month, the effort to use military commissions in the war against al Qaeda quietly turned 10. A decade ago, President George W. Bush dusted off a plan last used by President Franklin Roosevelt and ordered the Department of Defense to convene tribunals that would handle the cases of non-citizens for "offenses triable by military commissions." The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2001-11-16/html/01-28904.htm">initial order</a> was brief, but did suggest that such tribunals would have relaxed rules, admitting evidence that would "have probative value to a reasonable person."</p>

<p>As this was the first time in half a century that the US had proposed to use military commissions, understandable confusion arose. Commentators and politicians began a fierce debate about the nature of justice, the dangers of extraordinary tribunals, and the reach of international human rights law. To glimpse the nature of the intellectual battlefield, search "military commissions" in an online collection of law reviews, and limit the result to articles more than ten years old. Then take that limitation off, run the search again, and enjoy the flood.</p>

<p>From the beginning, proponents of military commissions (I was one) argued that this forum offered advantages. Unchecked by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/">Federal Rules of Evidence</a>, commissions might hear evidence of horrific acts not directly related to the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>. American survivors could tell their stories, but so could citizens of Indonesia and Turkey, London bus riders and attendees at Jordanian weddings. A global press, invited to record the first draft of history, could report these human tragedies. The ultimate fate of the defendants would be the commission's responsibility, but that was always a small part of the struggle. The larger ideological war could be fought in the commissions before a world audience. Prosecutors could demonstrate the shocking brutality that al Qaeda's philosophy demanded. This had been the driving objective of humanity's most important military commissions, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg that tried the leading Nazis after World War II.</p>

<p>There were also disadvantages. Nuremberg and its Tokyo counterpart, with their emphases on openness, were only one model of military commissions in the 1940s. The other model, exemplified by the commissions convened to try Germans who floated ashore in New York and Florida to wreak havoc on the US war effort, was remarkably secretive. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) quickly rounded up the saboteurs because one of them surrendered his colleagues. Knowledge of that fact might have emboldened German Chancellor Adolf Hitler to try this very expensive scheme again. Keeping the secret allowed the FBI to take credit for stopping these terrorists, and dissuaded Germany from future attempts. This precedent caused many commentators to fear that the current military commissions would be similarly secretive and unjust, offering up predetermined sentences (probably of death) to those caught in an international sweep. For years, the US had complained of regimes using extraordinary military tribunals for criminals, terrorists or dissidents. The sudden announcement that it might convene such new courts troubled many who were otherwise friendly to US interests. </p>

<p>Ten years later, the world has changed. <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">Osama Bin Laden is dead</a>. Al Qaeda is embattled throughout the world, no longer able to open training camps beneath the eyes of global satellites. An <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=protest%2Bmorocco+OR+egypt+OR+libya+OR+bahrain+OR+tunisia+OR+algeria+OR+syria">Arab Spring</a> swept much of al Qaeda's former recruiting grounds, replacing rage over oppression with hope for a better future. These changes have made the Nuremberg-like public information advantages of the military commissions disappear. Global networks, both media and social, report atrocities far more effectively than an elaborate trial could.</p>

<p>The disadvantages, sadly, remain. A trial of major al Qaeda figures early in the last decade could have demonstrated their crimes to the world. Today, it would look stilted and unnatural. The world would see a group long held out of the public eyesight subjected to an unorthodox procedure. Any elements of secrecy that occurred, any exclusion of the press from the tribunal, would spur conspiracy theories and anger. The lesson that al Qaeda is morally bankrupt has already been learned. Much of the world might well conclude, on watching military trials, that the US lacks faith in its own judicial system.</p>

<p>The woeful reality of the past decade makes these disadvantages more painful. Despite early proclamations that military commissions would be faster than civilian courts, no military commission reached a conviction until more than five years had passed. That <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-hicks-to-serve-most.php">first conviction</a> was a guilty plea, offered by a detainee to secure return to his home in Australia. More than another year passed before a commission reached a verdict in a contested trial. In August 2008, Bin Laden's former driver was convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-sentence-could-mean-fewer-than.php">sentenced</a>. Before the end of that year, he was freed in Yemen. Commissions only convicted three additional detainees in what remained of the decade.</p>

<p>Yet the US still holds al Qaeda leaders, none more significant than the alleged planner of the September 11 attacks, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>. For them, federal courts remain a viable option. Both before and since 2001, terrorists have been tried successfully in federal courts. Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted mastermind in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, is serving a life sentence in federal prison. So is <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-sentences-ex-guantanamo-detainee-to-life-imprisonment.php">Ahmed Ghailani</a>, convicted of the African embassy bombings. So does <a href="/thisday/2010/01/shoe-bomber-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">Richard Reid</a>, convicted of attempting to bring down a plane with a bomb in his shoe. And so on.</p>

<p>When the disadvantages of a program outlive its advantages, it is time to end it. Once the dark shadow of World War II had receded, the US did not again convene military commissions. In later decades, when old Nazis were discovered in hiding, they were tried before ordinary courts. The process of teaching the world the evils of Nazism being done, such people needed only to be judged as individuals, against the normal standards of the law. It is time to do the same with al Qaeda. It is time to stop granting them the status of warriors, even illicit ones. As the judge in Richard Reid's sentencing said to him, "you are not an enemy combatant. You are a terrorist."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Erica Menze, <a href="http://law.marquette.edu/">Marquette University Law School</a> Class of 2012, is a member of the <a href="http://law.marquette.edu/national-sports-law-institute/marquette-sports-law-review">Marquette Sports Law Review</a>. She writes on the implications of labor law and antitrust law on the National Football League's operations...<hr height='1'><font size='3'><strong>D</strong></font>uring the National Football League (NFL) lockout in 2011, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) &#8212; the NFL players' union &#8212; decertified in order to bring an antitrust suit against the NFL. If the NFLPA had not decertified, the players would only have been protected under labor law because of the antitrust exemptions it provides for union-employer bargaining in labor disputes. While many players prefer that the NFL operate in the antitrust law arena, more equitable outcomes will likely result from operation in the labor law arena. </p>

<p>Currently, the NFL operates under labor law standards. The union and the employer &#8212; in this case, the NFLPA and the NFL owners &#8212; negotiate a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in order to establish rules for how the relationship will work. The CBA covers a broad range of issues, including legal remedies and union earnings. When the negotiations reached an impasse this year, the NFL owners had the legal right under labor law to lockout the players. Usually, when a lockout occurs, the union can still collect employment benefits from the employer, such as insurance or pension benefits. If this occurred during the NFL lockout, the players still would have collected benefits under their union rights, but the owners would incur these costs without earning any profits for the lost football season. In addition, the NFLPA acquired lockout insurance, which guaranteed the players around $200,000 each, if the entire season had been canceled. While this amount is minuscule for many NFL stars, most players could comfortably survive on this amount for a lost season. This move could have been leveraged to push the owners for a new CBA. By staying in the realm of labor law, the players would have avoided the owners' perhaps valid allegations that decertification was a "sham" and that the players continued to act as a union. The NFLPA decertification was extremely risky. By decertifying, the NFLPA left its labor law protections and voluntarily joined the antitrust arena. As a result, the NFL or the NFLPA could have filed an antitrust suit against the other. </p>

<p>The players filed their antitrust suit, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10260430280729785179">Brady v. NFL</a>, first, claiming that the NFL owners engaged in anti-competitive acts in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_1.html">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> based on how they allotted NFL players in the draft and the use of franchise tags. Furthermore, the suit claimed that the owners prevented the players from reaching their full earning potential by enforcing salary caps. When the lockout ended with agreement on a new CBA, players went back to their teams, training camps started and the players dropped the suit. While football fans are fortunate to have a season, the legal world was left with a lingering question regarding the effects of labor law and antitrust law in the NFL. </p>

<p>Currently, every major sports league in the country operates in the labor law arena: baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer. Some sports even enjoy more specific antitrust exemptions, for example the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c105:5:./temp/~c10509OSz2::">Curt Flood Act</a> in baseball and <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3344.IH:">15 USC &#167; 1291</a> in football, which gives an exemption for broadcasting rights. The fact that all of the leagues operate in labor law tends to support the claim that labor law is more beneficial to the sports industry. For example, labor law in sports has provided the industry higher player salaries, large television contracts and in some sports greater disparity among the teams.</p>

<p>However, this does lead to an interesting question: how would the NFL operate if it acted solely under antitrust standards instead of labor law? What if there were no NFLPA, no CBA and no player allotment that comes from this contract? What if <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7494086478657562944">American Needle v. NFL</a> applied to everything the NFL does? What if the NFL acted as 32 separate and distinct teams, conducting business with the players? The answers to these questions would create a different version of the traditional NFL.   </p>

<p>First, the NFL owners could not negotiate television contracts for the entire league. Each individual team would pursue its own television rights, whether in its market territory or beyond. Teams with large populations in the viewing area would demand higher prices for broadcasting the game. On the other hand, teams in smaller markets, such as Green Bay or Buffalo, would charge lower prices due to the smaller population.</p>

<p>In addition, if the NFL did not operate under labor law then owners could not agree to revenue sharing because it would be anti-competitive, causing injury to any other entity trying to gain entry into the market. Teams would have the ability to earn greater profits depending on their market shares, not only in broadcasting contracts, but also on increased ticket and merchandise sales. Therefore, teams with a smaller market share would not be able to compete with those teams enjoying a larger market share. </p>

<p>Increased profits lead to the acquisition of the best players through high salaries. Since there could be no NFL draft or waiver system if the NFL were operating under antitrust laws, as both would very likely be found anti-competitive, players would have no obligations or incentives to sign with any particular team. Rationally, players would play for whichever team could pay them the highest salary. Accordingly, the small number of teams that would be able to attract the best players through paying the highest salaries would easily dominate the field. While everybody wants his or her own team to win, part of the excitement comes from an indefinite outcome. An increase in disparity among teams would mean losing excitement, which ultimately would mean losing fans for the league. Eventually, teams would begin moving or folding and the NFL would become less national and more regional.</p>

<p>Individual players have different outlooks regarding whether or not the NFL should operate under labor law. The more highly compensated players likely would prefer the anti-competitive method because with no salary cap their incomes would skyrocket, while the lower paid players likely favor labor law, as they benefit from the salary base set by the CBA. Ultimately, with 53 players on an active team roster, there are far more of the latter than the former. These same issues apply to the 32 NFL owners; there are far more owners that would suffer without labor law than would thrive. </p>

<p>Without labor law, each individual team would have to set its own benefits and each individual player would have to set his own demands. This would create an extremely inefficient negotiating process and difficulty in an industry where players risk serious injury for the entertainment of others.</p>

<p>From a fan's perspective, it is easy to see why the NFL and the NFLPA have a relationship under labor law. It allows all the parties involved to thrive and produce maximum profits, while maintaining a presence across the nation. However, the situation in <em>Brady v. NFL</em> proves the owners' argument that the NFLPA decertification was a "sham." If the NFLPA wants the benefits of the labor law exemption from antitrust, the union should also take the legal route carved out for it under labor law. The consequences under antitrust in this case are significant and players, owners and fans cannot bear these extreme consequences.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> of Webster University and the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, says that there is significant evidence that the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol violates international law by failing to further the goals of the treaty under which it was implemented...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/curtis_doebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>T</strong></font>he Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a primary means of carbon trading by which developed states meet their international obligations to cut greenhouse gas emissions below dangerous levels of emissions. At the same time, the CDM is intended to provide developing countries some badly need financing for their mitigation and adaptation efforts. </p>

<p>The CDM is allowed, but not required by the <a href="http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php">Kyoto Protocol</a>. When the US proposed CDM in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations, developing countries objected to them en masse. The CDM nevertheless came into existence as a compromise between developing countries who wanted to ensure developed countries limited their greenhouse gas emissions, and the developed countries seeking to use their dominate position to make their task of cutting emission easier. Ironically, the US remained outside the Kyoto Protocol regime even after having facilitated the uncomfortable compromise that led to the CDM.</p>

<p>Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol states that the "purpose of the clean development mechanism shall be to assist ... [developing states] ... in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)], and to assist ... [developing states] ... in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3 [of the UNFCCC]."</p>

<p>The first objective of the CDM stated in the Kyoto Protocol is to assist states in achieving sustainable development and contributing to the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. It is uncontroversial on its face. In the sense that the CDM helps states to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC, it merely reiterates existing treaty obligations. It does this mainly through a 2 percent tax on each Certified Emission Reductions (CER) credit, which are issued through the CDM to states which fund emissions reducing projects, and providing the funds raised to the Adaption Fund, which provides funding for adaptation projects in developing countries.</p>

<p>More controversial is the second objective of the CDM, which is to make cutting emissions less painful for states by allowing them to use the CDM to avoid having to cut their own emissions. Instead, well-developed, wealthy states can buy the right to pollute through CDMs. These countries finance projects that reduce emissions, buying CER credits from projects undertaken in developing countries. </p>

<p>In principle, safeguards exist requiring that a developed state seeking CER credits from a CDM project first obtain the permission of the developing state hosting the project, and that the project make a contribution to sustainable development. In practice, however, this permission is often forced by threats of other aid cuts or merely the unmet substantial needs of the developing state for their own development. In addition, developed states seeking CER credits must show that the CDM projects are "additional" and would not have been undertaken in the developing state in the normal course of business. Again, however, because developing countries rely on investment from developed countries, which often subsidize CDM projects, there are significant incentives for public and private investors to try to undertake projects under the CDM framework. In other words, the CDM carbon markets perpetuate themselves.</p>

<p>The rules regarding CDMs and their market-basis have led to very few CDM projects being undertaken in the almost 50 least developed countries in the world. While this is the case, Article 12, Paragraph 10 of the Kyoto Protocol allows states to get credit for projects undertaken between 2000 and 2005 &#8212; the time between when the Kyoto Protocol text was adopted and entered into force. </p>

<p>The CDM is the second largest carbon market in the world. Since its inception in 2001 it has issued about a billion CER credits, according to the latest figures presented by the CDM Executive Board. Each credit equals one ton of carbon dioxide. This accounts for more than 10 percent of all the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere each year, although the CDM figures are, of course, spread over almost a decade.</p>

<p>Many developing states are again pushing for the continuation of the CDMs even as they are pushing for the end of emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. In other words, they are trying to it both ways: eliminate the obligations they have to contribute to combating climate change, while at the same time earning credits for having done something when they have a financial incentive to act.</p>

<p>In addition, because of the market mechanism behind the CDMs, developed countries are able to push down the price of CER credits in CDM projects by cutting project costs. This provides an incentive to do the work on the cheap. While safeguards of state approval exist, these have been often been avoided or applied in meaningless fashion because the state so badly needs the investment. Conversely, private actors seeking to get CDM funding for a project in a developing  state have been known to exaggerate carbon emissions so that they can later claim to have reined them in, gaining even more CER credits.</p>

<p>In principle, CDMs are authorized by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, so on their face they are legal. However, the Kyoto Protocol contains obligations for developing states to cut their emissions. These obligations, according to Article 3, Paragraph 12, and Article 12, Paragraph 3(b) of the Kyoto Protocol Annex I, developing states may use the CER credits earned by CDMs to meet their obligations. </p>

<p>The Kyoto Protocol is a protocol to the UNFCCC and this is expressly referred to in Article 12, Paragraph 2, of the protocol. As such, states must ensure that any action taken under the Kyoto Protocol is consistent with their obligations under the UNFCCC. Actions that may be allowed by the Kyoto Protocol, but are inconsistent with the provisions of the UNFCCC are thus illegal.</p>

<p>Whether or not the CDMs are legal therefore depends on whether they are consistent with the provisions of the UNFCCC. In this respect, the overall objective of the UNFCCC is of primary importance. A treaty must always be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with its object and purpose according to customary international law, a principle which has also been agreed by most countries in the world in Article 31, Paragraph 1, of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/ha/vclt/vclt.html">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>. </p>

<p>The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is the "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system ... while at the same time ... allow[ing] ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened." </p>

<p>The deficiencies of adequate controls, the incentives for abuse, the lack of reliable measurements of a benefit of limiting carbon dioxide emissions, all point to uncertainty about whether or not CDMs contribute to "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system." Researchers arguing that CDMs actually contribute to dangerous levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are not difficult to find. </p>

<p>Recently, Neil Tangri and Dharmesh Shah of Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives have <a href="http://www.twnside.org.sg/title2/climate/info.service/2011/climate20110602.htm">argued</a> that a significant waste management project in India could add more than 500 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. When CDM projects contribute to an increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, they likely violate the provisions of the UNFCCC and create responsibility for the states involved.</p>

<p>This is not the only way in which CDMs might be contrary to international law. Article 2 of the UNFCCC also states that states shall reduce anthropogenic gases to below dangerous levels in the atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that economic development proceeds in a sustainable manner. Thus CDMs should contribute to sustainable development, but when they block sustainable development or make it more difficult they are contrary to the UNFCCC obligations.</p>

<p>Dr. Beth Jean Evans pointed out that market-led CDMs do not appear able to contribute to sustainable development in developing states. The author concludes that an "abandonment of market mechanisms may be necessary to facilitate the substantive participation of Southern nations in global emissions abatement efforts which is required by the severity of the climate crisis." If Evans's well-researched conclusions are correct, as they appear to be, then CDMs might actually be hindering the achievement of sustainable development in developing states. If this is the case then they are an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives in Article 2 of the UNFCCC and violate this treaty.</p>

<p>The legality of the CDM depends on several variables which are to date unsatisfactorily confirmed, but the preliminary evidence that is available is sufficient to support the claim that a significant number of CDMs violate international law. Thus while the CDM as a whole may be legal, it may also give rise to many illegal activities. Such a situation is at least bad policy regardless of its legality.</p>

It marked a time for reconciliation. It also marked the opening of the third act in the tragedy of the US-Iraq fiasco that welcomed the second millennium with a decade of turmoil and death. Neither the first act &#8212; the illegal invasion, nor the second act &#8212; the frustrating occupation, will measure up to the chaos of the third act &#8212; the ensuing break-up of the country and destabilization of the entire Middle East. And yet, the third act could have been largely avoided had the US worked to build stronger legal and constitutional structures during its long stay in the Mesopotamian desert.</p>

<p><strong>ACT 1</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">invasion of Iraq</a> by US-led forces in spring 2003 was illegal under international law. President George W. Bush had secured the necessary authorization for war from Congress, but he could not convince the UN Security Council to issue the other necessary use of force authorization. Despite strong pleas by the UK and US, the French, Russians and Germans remained skeptical that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction and was ready to use them.</p>

<p>Denied the legal go-ahead, Bush remained resolute in his determination to topple Saddam Hussein. White House and Defense Department lawyers reverse engineered the self-defense provisions of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>. Article 51 states, "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." The president's lawyers argued the word "inherent" was a pass-through provision that allowed all the old pre-Charter, pre-1945, customary laws of war to survive.  </p>

<p>One such law was the pre-emptive strike doctrine &#8212; allowing a state to attack first if it was under threat of imminent attack, thereby relieving it of the obligation to absorb the first blow. The problem here was the breaking mechanism. A state availing itself of this doctrine had to be responding to an imminent attack. Saddam was no such threat. So the president's lawyers watered down that evidentiary showing from "imminent" to "emerging" in the <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2002/">2002 National Security Strategy</a>. Iraq certainly could be considered an emerging threat. So the US lawyered its way into the second Iraq War in 2003 despite widespread condemnation.</p>

<p><strong>ACT 2</strong></p>

<p>The occupation of Iraq was a long and bloody affair. Shortly after routing Saddam's forces and capturing the leader himself, US-led occupation forces stridently de-Baathified all units of the government and security structures across the country. Unlike the de-Nazification program undertaken in occupied Germany, which targeted true believers and left well-qualified people in charge of running the machinery of the state, the program unleashed by Paul Bremer in Iraq wiped out the careers of those most able to stabilize the country.</p>

<p>Giving way at the seams, Iraq then tipped into civil war &#8212; dividing along sectarian lines and foreshadowing what is to come in Act 3. Sunni Arabs, recently deposed, lashed out against the resurgent Shia Arab majority and Baghdad became a war zone once again with American forces caught in the cross-fire. The Kurds to the north stayed out of the fracas, but continued to wait for the right moment to make a play for independence &#8212; a dream long-harbored since the founding of Iraq in 1921.</p>

<p>Bloodletting and political convulsions continued until a surge of US troops in early 2007 brought the situation under control. But by 2008, when much of the violence in Iraq had been quelled, the US presidential election was in full swing and key government policy planning officials in the Bush State and Defense departments were departing. Consequently, very little planning for the future of Iraq was underway. A <a href="http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2005/issue3/Iraqiconstitution/constitution.html">constitution</a> had been written for Iraq creating a federation. Informal power-sharing arrangements had been implemented with a Kurd as ceremonial president, a Shia Arab as prime minister, and a Sunni Arab as parliamentary speaker. Short-term political stability was the goal and it had been achieved.</p>

<p>What had not been achieved was putting the legal structures in place to maintain that stability once the US departed.  This can partially be explained by two themes: transition in Washington, DC, and political immaturity in Baghdad. Washington was consumed in 2009 with Bush's people leaving and President Barack Obama's people coming in. Aside from obvious holdovers like Defense Secretary Robert Gates, very few of the Obama crew were clued into the relationships required to interface with Iraq in a positive way and suggest the long-term structures they needed: stable and independent courts, the rule of law, new law schools, civil and criminal code revisions, constitutional frameworks for the regions, accommodation for minority rights, settlement of sectarian hot-buttons (like who controls Kirkuk and its oil), and so on. Then Baghdad was consumed in 2010 with a 9-month stand-off between the first and second-place finishers in <a href="/feature/2011/12/iraq-war.php#politics">parliamentary elections</a> where no government could be formed to make the deals necessary to negotiate those structures. Thus, two years were lost.  </p>

<p><strong>ACT 3</strong></p>

<p>Now, at the close of 2011, the final act of this three-part tragedy is set to unfold. History has shown that when a unifying force is removed from a disparate political system unbuttressed by strong legal structures, the parts of that system tend to fly apart. The breakup of the Soviet Union upon the collapse of communism and the similar breakup of Yugoslavia are but recent examples. Older ones like the fall of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires exist as well. Indeed, the only thing holding ethnically and linguistically diverse China together today is the Han dictatorship. </p>

<p>Iraq was cobbled together by the British after World War I by melding three Ottoman provinces together: Mosul (with the Kurds), Baghdad (with the Sunni Arabs), and Basra (with the Shia Arabs). None of the three groups necessarily wanted to share a state, but that was dictated from London and the office of Winston Churchill &#8212; then colonial secretary. Historians might argue that past is prologue. The other post-World War I amalgamations (Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia) have also dissolved and it is likely, absent a strong central figure like Saddam or equally strong national and legal institutions, Iraq will share the same fate once the centralizing force of the US departs.</p>

<p>Unresolved political landmines dot the constitutional landscape of this country like oil-sharing arrangements among the government and its regions and the lingering <a href="/forum/2009/11/kirkuk-danger-of-delay.php">Kirkuk issue</a> &#8212; the Kurds claim it, but the Iraqi federal government will not let it go. Add to this the increasing and unchecked influence of Iran over the Shia-dominated government, cross-border strikes by Turkish military into Iraqi Kurdistan in pursuit of terrorists, destabilization along the Sunni regional border in neighboring Syria, and still depressingly low petroleum production. Such macro forces combine quickly with micro forces frustrating the population (continual power outages, no legal recourse, lack of civil society, political instability, corrupt police and courts) and the recipe for disaster is clear.</p>

<p>Departing American troops will be replaced with a 15,000-strong contingent of civilian contractors and diplomats hiding behind the walls of the Green Zone in Baghdad. Their mission: to do what should have been done from 2008 to 2011 &#8212; stabilize the country by training Iraqis how to actually govern themselves on a daily basis, negotiate compromises, mediate disputes, work the levers of democracy and the privileges of freedom within the context of something approaching regional and federal governing structures with durable and trustworthy institutions and develop the civic religion of the country that could help bring it a national identity. This mission will fail because the groundwork was not laid for it to succeed.</p>

<p>Soon the Saudi royal house will begin reasserting its influence over Iraq's Sunni Arabs to counter the influence of Iran's Mullahs over Iraq's Shia Arabs. The twin tensions funded by those two contentious outsiders that gave us the 2005-2008 Iraq civil war will be at it again. But no surge of American troops will arrive this time to bail them out. A weak national government with a population that does not trust it will not be able to withstand such forces. If Iraq crumbles and three new states emerge they will be problematic from the outset.</p>

<p><img alt="Iraq Ethnoreligious groups.jpg" src="/forum/Iraq%20Ethnoreligious%20groups.jpg" width="364" height="400" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;"></p>

<p>The Shia Arab state will clearly be the client state of their Persian Shia cousins. The Sunni Arab state will be devoid of oil and, therefore, broke upon birth. The Kurdish state will activate restive Kurdish populations in Turkey, Iran and Syria to join it &#8212; destabilizing all three major regional powers. Baghdad will implode. Israel will watch with trepidation and foreboding but, hopefully, do nothing to exacerbate the situation. Where the violence will end would be anyone's guess, but the Americans would be loath to return and helicopters lifting off the roofs of embassy installations may ensue &#8212; Saigon-style.</p>

<p>Act 3 of this tragedy need not have occurred. But short-term accommodations, lack of long-term vision, and the failure to adequately build up this country on the civil side of the equation make it almost inevitable. True, overly creative lawyering for ill purposes can lead to bad consequences, as in Act 1. But lawyers tend to bring some level of stability if they operate within the rule of law and agree on the basic social contract of the country underlying their legal framework. Iraq does not have this. Fights are resolved with guns, not words. Their constitutionalism has not developed to the point of self-government yet, as seen in Act 2. We shall see by the end of 2013 which path Iraq takes in Act 3. I hope it is one of peace and stability. I fear this will not be the case.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Special Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> of Webster University and the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, says the US and other aggressors in the Iraq War have not had to face legal recourse for their numerous violations of international law in the invasion and occupation of Iraq...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT"cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/curtis_doebbler.jpg" align="LEFT" hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="5"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><imgsrc="/images/s.gif" height="1" width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong><em>T</strong></font>o initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.</em><br />
<div style="text-align: right;">Robert Jackson, American Prosecutor at Nuremberg</div> </p>

<p>It is usual for lawyer in the US and Europe to speak about the impunity of states and their leaders in Africa, the Middle East and Asia escaping punishment for their misdeeds that violate international law. In fact, history shows us that over the past century it has been Western governments and their leaders who have just as often, or more often, committed international crimes for which they have not been punished.</p>

<p>The aggression against the people of Iraq starting in 1992, cumulating in the <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">full-scale invasion of the country</a> starting in March 2003, and continuing through the occupation is no exception.</p>

<p>The use of force against Iraq and the egregious acts against the people of Iraq are once again examples of some of the most serious violations of international law that have gone unpunished. The most significant beneficiaries of this immunity have been Americans, but they are not the only ones. Moreover, some the individuals who defended the aggression against Iraq have not only escaped punishment but have been elevated to such positions as international representatives of their country, UN envoys, professors of law, heads of law firms, and even a judge of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Perhaps not all of these people were legally culpable for the acts of aggression that have been reliably estimated to be responsible for as many a one-and-half million Iraqi deaths. The mere fact that these individuals justified such illegal actions must make any defender of the rule of international law cringe.</p>

<p>Given the gravity of the harm done to the people to Iraq, it is neither inappropriate nor a gross exaggeration to compare the situation to the Holocaust during World War II. Could anyone imagine allowing immunity for that atrocity? In fact, the world did not, as Justice Robert Jackson's quote suggests. So why do we fail to act the perpetrators and defenders of such crimes when they happen to Iraqis? It is certainly not because the law is unclear.</p>

<p>For a state to be responsible for an internationally wrongful act it is necessary to find an act attributable to a state that violates that state's international obligations. That the use of force against Iraq is attributable to the US and its allies cannot be doubted. Senior US government officials acknowledged &#8212; even bragged &#8212; that the attack was attributable to the US. Other governments such as the UK and the Netherlands, although more humbly, also acknowledged that they had been involved in a use of force against Iraq.</p>

<p>We know that the use of force is prohibited under international law not only because the treaty that prevails over all other treaties, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> tells us that in Article 2, Paragraph 4, but because customary international law has repeatedly emphasized the importance of the prohibition of the use of force by one state against another.</p>

<p>The ICJ has repeatedly held that the prohibition of use of force is part of customary international law. The 1986 case of <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=367&code=nus&p1=3&p2=3&case=70&k=66&p3=5">Nicaragua v. United States of America</a> is perhaps the most cited of the many examples that can be found. Paragraph 4 reads in relevant part that "the United States of America, by certain attacks on Nicaraguan territory ... which involve the use of force, has acted, against the Republic of Nicaragua, in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to use force against another State." While the US eventually agreed to an in-kind reparation, it has acted with impunity long after this case. </p>

<p>The US was more recently found to have acted in violation of the prohibition of the use of force against Iran in the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,ICJ,,IRN,,414ada66f,0.html">Case Concerning Oil Platforms</a> decided in 2003. The US again escaped with impunity based on a jurisdictional limitation, despite having clearly violated the international law prohibiting of the use of force.</p>

<p>In the case of Iraq the overwhelming view of legal experts is that the use of force was a violation of international law. These legal experts include a Dutch Government Panel, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the International Commission of Jurists, the National Lawyers' Guild, Greenpeace, the Lawyers' Committee on Nuclear Policy, and even the then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, among many others.</p>

<p>The Dutch Government Panel concluded that there was no justification for the use of force and that the commonly relied upon UN Security Council <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3dda0f634.html">Resolution 1441</a> "cannot reasonably be interpreted as authorizing individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council's resolutions." Still no case has been heard against any state for its use of force against Iraq.  </p>

<p>While state responsibility for the use of force against Iraq is perhaps the most egregious case of impunity in relation to the aggression against the Iraqi people, it is unfortunately not the only one. Although several lawyers filed human rights cases against the US and UK governments for their <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/us-inspectors-find-signs-of-iraq.php">abuse of prisoners</a> and for unfair <a href="/feature/2011/12/iraq-war.php#trial">trial of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein</a>, most of these cases have resulted in impunity in unusual ways that do not strengthen the integrity of the international bodies that dealt with them. </p>

<p>Cases filed against the US in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights alleging the violation of international humanitarian law for its actions against prisoners of war in Guantanamo Bay have either remained dormant or have been ignored. The first case filed for the treatment of Afghan prisoners of war in 2001 remains without any response more than a decade later. A <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/guantanamo-detainee-files-rights.php">subsequent case</a> filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights was the subject of multiple favorable decisions on interim measures, but the US openly ignored these decisions.</p>

<p>Only in July 2011 did the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) finally end the impunity of the UK for its violations of the right to life of persons under their control in the cases of <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=887952&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Al-Skeini v. UK</a> and <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=887954&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Al-Jedda v. UK</a>. In doing so, the Court stressed the exceptional circumstances of the cases as if to apologize for finding that the UK had violated human rights. </p>

<p>Years ago, cases filed on Saddam's behalf, who the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention twice determined was subject to an unfair trial and arbitrary detention in violation of international law, were dismissed by the ECHR. The Court claimed that there was no proof that the US and the UK had control over the Iraqi president. They refused to accept the evidence of a letter jointly signed by the US and the UK governments stating that they were the occupying powers in Iraq and the well-established principle of international humanitarian law that occupying powers are responsible for prisoners held by the occupying powers. The Washington, DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has refused to rule on petition by the Iraqi president to this day.</p>

<p>In addition to State impunity, the violence in Iraq has also given rise to much individual impunity. While a small number of military and private contractors have been found guilty of serious crimes against Iraqis, the overwhelming majority have either not been prosecuted or have received such <em>de minimus</em> sentences as to make the prosecutions almost meaningless. </p>

<p>The failure to adequately investigate and prosecute the serious international crimes against Iraqis devalues the rule of international law. Fortunately, it may not be too late to recover the value of the law, if that is what we really want to do. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.edu/fac-staff/williamsv/">Victor Williams</a> of The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law says that President Obama should ignore pro forma sessions of Congress and exercise his constitutional authority to make recess appointments in order to overcome the obstructionism that has left countless federal positions open...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/victorwilliams1.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>O</strong></font>ver the past two decades, the Senate confirmation process has steadily deteriorated &#8212; from dawdling to dysfunctional to outright broken. The destructive cycle of confirmation obstruction and partisan payback worsened with each presidency. Barack Obama entered the White House seeking to "move beyond" this conflictive pattern. Instead, his nominees suffered vengeful partisan payback for past obstruction of President George W. Bush's appointments. In January 2010, hundreds of important vacancies remained unfilled and only 12 federal judges had been benched. </p>

<p>With prolonged delay as the goal, the variety and intensity of obstructionist procedures substantially increased. Extreme slow-walking, committee hearing defamations, extortion holds, and outright filibusters became the upper chamber's ordinary business. In the 112th Senate, the Republican minority fully embraced appointment obstructionism as a means to accomplish Mitch McConnell's stated priority &#8212; defeat Obama's reelection. The most recent obstruction escalation amounts to outright nullification &#8212; a partisan assault against republican governance. Scores of critically important federal posts are purposely kept vacant for months and even years; the government is purposely hobbled. </p>

<p>The Constitution's wise Framers hoped for the best and planned for the worst &#8212; <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2">Article II, Section 2</a> thus provides two methods of principal officer appointment. In addition to the now-fractured nomination-confirmation process, "the President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session." With a recess appointment, the president simply signs the commission and immediately the official is put to work. Recess commissioned officials carry full power, including judicial authority, for up to 24 months, and then may be consecutively reappointed during another Senate recess.</p>

<p>Partisans now seek to block Obama's recess appointment authority. House and Senate Republicans have joined together to manipulate congressional schedules to hold sham pro-forma sessions. Thus, President Obama is now given a unique opportunity for a fulsome assertion of his appointment authority. He should use the bully pulpit to expose and challenge confirmation obstruction, and he should assertively utilize his recess commissioning authority.  </p>

<p><strong>Nullification by Appointment Obstruction</strong></p>

<p>Confirmation obstruction has resulted in systemic damage to a range of executive, regulatory and judicial operations. The vacancies are too numerous to fully report here. Take for example the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which again loses its quorum at the end of the year when three of five seats become vacant. Last year, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3193633384780074197">New Process Steel v. National Labor Relations Board</a>, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-nlrb-must-have-3-member-panel-to-exercise-authority.php">voided over 400 NLRB rulings</a> made when the agency last lost a quorum. Similarly, opponents of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) &#8212; who were unable to defeat the agency's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">enabling legislation</a> &#8212; sabotage its fledgling operations through obstruction. Forty-four Republican Senators preemptively pledged to block appointment of "any" director nominee. Without a director, the CFPB lacks authority to regulate non-bank financial fraud. Additionally, the federal court system has shameful "vacancy emergencies" across the nation due to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/legal-reform-groups-urge-us-government-to-make-judicial-nominations-top-priority.php">blocked nominations</a>. </p>

<p>Obama's economic policy nominees have been particularly targeted for confirmation abuse. The Republican members of Congress purposely retard the government's ability to respond to the economic crisis. Two years after Obama successfully fought for Ben Bernanke's reappointment in 2009, two out of the seven Federal Reserve Board seats remain vacant. Peter Diamond's confirmation ordeal &#8212; including three separate nominations &#8212; is too typical. Diamond's 2010 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences only reinforced Senator Richard Shelby's (R-AL) provincial animus against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.</p>

<p>In June 2011, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner explained that obstruction creates conditions that could help "bring down" our financial system, making it "less likely that there will be enough capable people in the regulatory bodies to bring the care and judgment necessary for the new rules to work." That Obama personally persuaded Geithner to delay his 2011 plans to leave the Treasury Department highlights the perception that the US Senate could not be trusted to timely confirm a replacement.   </p>

<p>Perversely, the systemic damage to the national government serves to encourage rather than deter partisan obstructionists. In December 2011, Senate Republicans further escalated the confirmation battle, including by using formal filibusters to deny Caitlin Halligan an up-or-down vote for a seat on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had been vacant for six years, and formally blocking Richard Cordray from leading the CFPB. Responding to the most recent "unwarranted and irresponsible" filibuster of Halligan, White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler described the Senate as entering "a new age of obstruction." Commentators, such as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/a-republican-doubles-down-on-nullification/249820/">James Fallows</a>, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/92167/cordray-warren-cfpb-obama-republicans-nomination">Thomas Mann</a>, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/98333/senate-republicans-block-cordray-consumer-cfpb-nomination-obama">Jonathan Cohn</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_12/a_radical_embrace_of_nullifica034050.php">Steve Benen</a>, analyze the escalating confirmation obstruction as "new nullification." John Calhoun's nineteenth century theory of a dissatisfied minority exercising raw power to invalidate, disrupt or void majority rule is alive and well in the 112th Senate.  </p>

<p><strong>Recess Appointment Alternative</strong></p>

<p>For the first three years of escalating confirmation obstruction, administration supporters encouraged Obama to sign recess commissions. From George Washington forward, strong presidents have used the recess power to keep the government fully staffed. Theodore Roosevelt recess commissioned over 160 officials in an en masse signing during a "constructive recess" lasting only seconds between the two sessions of the 58th Senate. Ronald Reagan recess appointed a total of 240 federal officials, George H.W. Bush appointed 74 in one term, Bill Clinton 139 and George W. Bush 171. Obama has thus far signed only 28 recess commissions.</p>

<p>Since Fall 2010, however, obstructionists have manipulated the Senate into holding pro forma sessions, perfunctory sessions in which no business is conducted &#8212; every three days during breaks &#8212; in attempts to prevent recess appointments. The scheme relies on a questionable 1993 nonbinding Justice Department memo suggesting that a three-day recess minimum is needed to trigger appointment authority. There is no three-day recess minimum, however. The three-day recess myth is further premised on purposeful misapplication of the three-day congressional adjournment consent requirement of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section5">Article I, Section 5</a>: "neither chamber can adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other." Of course, the Article I chamber comity requirement has no application to the Article II presidential appointment authority. (Then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-senate-delays-vote-on-telecom.php">orchestrated</a> similar sham sessions in 2007 to successfully bluff President George W. Bush out of making recess appointments.) </p>

<p>There is no minimum Senate recess required to trigger the president's appointment authority, however. In the 2004 case of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14575856744547292492">Evans v. Stephens</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated explicitly: "The Constitution, on its face, does not establish a minimum time that an authorized break in the Senate must last to give legal force to the President's appointment power under the Recess Appointments Clause."</p>

<p>Obama's choice not to immediately push back in 2010 was perhaps perceived as capitulation by congressional opponents. After Republicans took majority of the 112th House in 2011, a group of 77 Republican freshmen pressured House Speaker John Boehner to begin scheduling pro forma sessions in the House &#8212; withholding Article I, Section 5 adjournment consent &#8212; to prevent the Senate from recessing. This House manipulation of the upper chamber's business is historic. After the Washington, DC earthquake in August 2011, the Senate met off-site for the sole purpose of sticking to the sham schedule. For the first time since the 1814 British arson, a non-ceremonial session of the US Senate was conducted outside of the Capitol building in order to perpetuate the obstruction. The House has now scheduled all of 2012 to keep itself and the Senate in pro-forma session solely to obstruct recess appointments. </p>

<p><strong>Faithful Execution of the Law/Commission All Officers</strong></p>

<p>John F. Kennedy famously stated in 1963: "Our problems are man-made, therefore they may be solved by man." Knowing well that the government needs the most talented women and men available, President Kennedy adopted an assertive and progressive appointment strategy which included signing recess commissions for over 20 percent of his judicial choices. </p>

<p>In the fourth year of his presidency, Obama needs and deserves a fully staffed government. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section3">Article II, Section 3</a> charges that the Executive "<strong>shall</strong> take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and <strong>shall</strong> Commission all the Officers of the United States." Obama must expose confirmation obstruction as nullification and actively campaign against it. To clear the growing vacancy backlog and preserve appointment prerogatives for future presidents, Obama must substantially increase and regularize his use of the Article II, Section 2 recess alternative. Concurrent with signing recess commissions, President Obama should renounce congressional "pro forma sessions" with a simple test: If the Senate is not sitting as a deliberative body able to provide timely confirmation consent, the Executive may fill any vacant federal office. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Nathan Crombie, <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/">Columbia Law School</a> Class of 2012, is currently researching the influence of international human rights law on same-sex marriage. Here he argues that international law should influence the Ninth Circuit's ruling on same-sex marriage...<hr height='1'><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/nathancrombie.jpg" align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"></td><td><img src="images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"></td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size='3'><strong>T</strong></font>he US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-proposition-8-issues.php">considering the constitutionality of Proposition 8</a>, the 2008 initiative that amended the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">California Constitution</a> to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman would be recognized by the state. In determining the initiative's constitutionality, the court will follow the approach of Judge Vaughn Walker of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, subjecting Proposition 8 to analysis under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> of the US Constitution. These clauses will invite scrutiny of the validity of asserted governmental interests in confining marriage to opposite-sex couples. However, traditional constitutional analysis does not involve examination of US obligations under international human rights law. Neglecting to analyze these obligations removes a valuable reference favoring same-sex marriage recognition, bucking an increasing trend among foreign courts.</p>

<p>The principal obligations relevant to the issue of same-sex marriage are contained in the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR). The US signed the ICCPR in 1977 and ratified it in 1992, subject to a number of reservations, understandings and declarations. Article 26 of the ICCPR provides that all persons are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection under it. In this respect, state parties must guarantee equal and effective protection against discrimination on a number of grounds, including sex, race and "other status."   </p>

<p>The Human Rights Committee is a body of independent experts charged with overseeing the implementation of the ICCPR by state parties, and it carries out this task in two ways. First, it periodically issues "general comments" that interpret the rights set out in the ICCPR. Second, it sits in a quasi-judicial capacity and makes non-binding recommendations in response to communications by nationals against those state parties that have acceded to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr-one.htm">First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR</a>.  </p>

<p>The committee has provided significant guidance on how to interpret Article 26. In <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/3888b0541f8501c9c12563ed004b8d0e?Opendocument">General Comment 18</a>, the committee observed that Article 26 is a stand-alone right that prohibits discrimination in "any field" regulated and protected by public authorities. If a state party discriminated in a regulated field, it would need to advance "reasonable and objective" criteria for doing so. In the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/d22a00bcd1320c9c80256724005e60d5">Toonen v. Australia</a> communication of 1994, the committee held that prohibited discrimination on the grounds of "sex" in Article 26 included discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. On its face, these two interpretations suggest that in regulating the institution of marriage the US would have to do so on a non-discriminatory basis that included same-sex couples.</p>

<p>However, Article 23(2) provides that "[t]he right of men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family shall be recognized." Taking into account the historical context of the ICCPR and its official negotiation records, this right is generally accepted as being limited in scope to opposite-sex marriage. This was confirmed in the <a href="http://www.bayefsky.com/pdf/newzealand_t5_iccpr_902_1999.pdf">Joslin v. New Zealand</a> [PDF] communication of 2002. There, the committee dismissed arguments that Article 26 required New Zealand to provide same-sex marriage. It held that Article 26 must be read in light of the guarantee of heterosexual marriage in Article 23(2). The committee neglected to conduct a "reasonable and objective" inquiry into the denial of same-sex marriage because overwhelming state practice exhibited a "consistent and uniform" understanding that marriage was innately heterosexual. At this time, the Netherlands was the only country to have <a href="/thisday/2011/04/netherlands-became-first-jurisdiction-to-allow-same-sex-marriage.php">enacted same-sex marriage</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2002, state practice in the area of same-sex marriage has changed significantly. There are currently 10 countries in the world that allow same-sex marriage, along with <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">six states</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-dc-same.php">District of Columbia</a> in the US itself. Proponents of same-sex marriage are making substantial gains in countries such as <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/australia-ruling-party-amends-platform-to-support-same-sex-marriage.php">Australia</a> and the UK, suggesting that the number of jurisdictions instituting marriage equality will continue to increase over time. With this increased recognition, the committee would have less room to circumvent a reasonable and objective inquiry on the basis of state practice if the issue of same-sex marriage came before it today. Recent communications holding that the denial of survivor pensions to those who had been in same-sex relationships violated Article 26 furthermore suggest that state parties would have difficulty persuading the committee that there were "reasonable and objective" bases for continuing to deny recognition of same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Although the US is not a party to the First Optional Protocol to the ICCPR, it would be inadvisable for the Ninth Circuit to ignore the committee's "jurisprudential trend" towards finding that denial of same-sex marriage violates the equality guarantee in Article 26. This is because the "understandings" the US filed upon ratifying the ICCPR indicated that it would provide at least an equivalent, if not greater, guarantee of equality than provided for under the ICCPR. The first understanding asserted that the US Constitution provides "extensive protections against discrimination," and provided that distinctions drawn on a ground that invoked Article 26 would be permitted when they were, at minimum, related to a legitimate government objective. This is a clear reference to Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence under the Fourteenth Amendment. Given that the committee's "reasonable and objective criteria" inquiry raises substantially similar issues as an Equal Protection analysis, the Ninth Circuit should give weight to the committee's rejection of these justifications when it evaluates the state interests advanced in favor of upholding Proposition 8. Doing so will ensure harmonization between the levels of equal protection recognized by the US under the Equal Protection Clause, and by the committee under Article 26. The court will also ensure it fulfills its duty under the compliance with the fifth understanding, which provides that the ICCPR shall be implemented to the extent the federal government exercises judicial jurisdiction over issues raised under it.  </p>

<p>Abandoning the traditionally myopic attitude towards international law in the context of same-sex marriage cases will also bring federal courts in line with trends in overseas jurisdictions. Courts in New Zealand and <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/south-africa-high-court-says-same-sex.php">South Africa</a> have specifically invoked Article 26 of the ICCPR when ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. In New Zealand, two Court of Appeal justices in the <a href="http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Quilter%20v.pdf">Quilter v. Attorney-General</a> [PDF] decision, the precursor to the <em>Joslin</em> communication before the committee, discussed the state's obligation to comply with Article 26 of the ICCPR. Justice Keith concluded that Article 23(2), reflecting traditional heterosexual marriage, was the governing position when set against Article 26. In contrast, Justice Thomas cited the committee's test for compliance with Article 26 by concluding that the state had failed to advance sufficiently reasonable and objective criteria to justify limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. Similarly, Justice Sachs on the Constitutional Court of South Africa referred to the state's obligations under Article 26 in ruling that denial of same-sex marriage was unconstitutional in <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2005/19.html">Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie</a>. In the legislative context, advocates of same-sex marriage in recent Australian debates on marriage equality have relied extensively on the Article 26 equality guarantee when making submissions before the Senate Committee considering draft marriage equality legislation.</p>

<p>The invocation of Article 26 by national courts is just one example of a dyadic process between the international and domestic law strata in the development of new human rights norms. The committee is emboldened to give more robust interpretations to the Article 26 equality guarantee when it sees state practice moving more and more in the direction of marriage equality. Likewise, national courts can point to the increasingly progressive interpretations being given to Article 26 by the committee when seeking to insulate their decisions from charges of judicial activism, as occurred in response to the original <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">2008 Supreme Court of California decision</a> holding that the state denial of same-sex marriage violated the equality guarantees of the California Constitution. More practically, committee communications on Article 26 in the context of sexual orientation discrimination canvass similar issues that arise when courts are faced with direct questions on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage. This is particularly the case in the US, where courts conduct Equal Protection analysis that parallels the "reasonable and objective" inquiry under Article 26. When additional consideration is given to US understandings to the ICCPR, there is a persuasive and sound basis for the Ninth Circuit to consider international human rights law when determining the constitutionality of Proposition 8.</p>

Conti</a> preliminarily enjoining North Carolina from distributing its "Choose Life" license plate, which had been authorized by <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/enactedlegislation/statutes/pdf/bysection/chapter_20/gs_20-79.4.pdf">statute</a> [PDF] earlier in the year. According to the district court, because North Carolina had created a forum for private speech by offering over 100 such specialty license plates, it could not permit an allegedly pro-life message ("Choose Life") while prohibiting a message that supported abortion rights ("Respect Choice"). The court found that "by authorizing the 'Choose Life' plate without also offering a pro-choice alternative, the State has engaged in impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment." The district court based its decision in large part on two prior cases from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15870667238312169402">Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles</a> (SCV) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2553287917580858154">Planned Parenthood of South Carolina Inc. v. Rose</a>. Contrary to the district court's order, though, the US Supreme Court's recent decisions in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8395881287361075212">Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-decides-first-amendment.php">Pleasant Grove City v. Summum</a> undermine the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in <em>SCV</em> and <em>Rose</em>. In fact, under the Supreme Court's "newly minted" government speech doctrine, North Carolina has "the right to 'speak for itself,'" which includes the right to allow a "Choose Life" plate but not a "Respect Choice" plate.</p>

<p>In <em>Conti</em>, the district court properly noted that the dispositive issue was "whether the 'Choose Life' license plate constitutes government speech." To determine whether North Carolina was speaking through its "Choose Life" plate, the court relied on the four-factor test that the Fourth Circuit developed in <em>SCV</em> and <em>Rose</em>. In particular, the court considered: (i) the central purpose of the program in which the speech occurs, (ii) the extent of editorial control the government or private entity exercises over the content of the speech, (iii) the identity of the literal speaker, and (iv) whether the government or the private entity is ultimately responsible for the content of the speech. Following Judge Michael's decision in <em>Rose</em>, Judge Fox found that North Carolina's specialty plate was a form of "hybrid" speech, or speech that involved attributes of both private and government speech. As Judge Michael, who wrote the most detailed of the three opinions in <em>Rose</em>, explained, although the state controlled the content of the plate:<blockquote>the specialty plate gives private individuals the option to identify with, purchase, and display one of the authorized messages. ... The private individual bears the ultimate responsibility for the speech on the Choose Life plate ... [because] the private individual chooses to spend additional money to obtain the plate and to display its pro-life message on her vehicle.</blockquote>Given that private individuals were the actual speakers and bore the ultimate responsibility for conveying the message on the "Choose Life" plate, North Carolina could not be engaging in viewpoint discrimination. As a result, Judge Fox held that ACLU-NC was likely to prevail on its claims and granted the preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decisions in <em>Johanns</em> and <em>Summum</em>, however, the district court erred in adhering to the Fourth Circuit's <em>SCV/Rose</em> test for at least three reasons. First, although Judge Fox correctly notes that post-<em>Johanns</em> the Fourth Circuit has considered the identity of the literal speaker when deciding whether the government was speaking, <em>Summum</em> clarifies that the government speech doctrine is inconsistent with <em>SCV</em> and <em>Rose</em>. Contrary to the order in <em>Conti</em>, neither <em>Johanns</em> nor <em>Summum</em> takes the "identity of the literal speaker" as central to the government speech inquiry. In <em>Johanns</em>, the Court expressly stated that the "correct focus is not on whether the ads' audience realizes the Government is speaking, but on the compelled assessment's purported interference with respondents' First Amendment rights." That is, as Justice Souter acknowledged in his dissent, the <em>Johanns</em> majority focused on the government's "control" over the message, not a third party's ability to identify the government as the speaker. Whereas Justice Souter claimed that the government speech doctrine applied only if the government's control over the message was "made apparent to those who get the message," the majority took "the view that because Congress authorized this scheme and the Government controls (or at least has a veto on) the content of the beef ads, the need for democratic accountability has been satisfied."</p>

<p>Similarly, in <em>Summum</em>, Justice Souter argued that the identity requirement was not limited to the compelled subsidy context of Johanns: "the government should lose [the protection of the government speech doctrine] when the character of the speech is at issue and its governmental nature has not been made clear." Hence, in <em>Summum</em>, Justice Souter proposed a reasonable observer test that mirrored the identity requirement of <em>SCV</em> and <em>Rose</em>: "the best approach that occurs to me is to ask whether a reasonable and fully informed observer would understand the expression to be government speech."</p>

<p>In both <em>Johanns</em> and <em>Summum</em> a majority of the Court rejected Justice Souter's identity test, however. Although, as <em>Conti</em> notes, <em>Summum</em> acknowledged that "persons who observe donated monuments routinely &#8212; and reasonably &#8212; interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner's behalf," the Court made this statement while explaining why <em>Summum</em> was not a difficult case in which to determine whether the government was speaking. In <em>Summum</em>, not only did the government "effectively control" the message &#8212; the essential consideration under the Court's government speech doctrine &#8212; but also there was no chance that someone would mistake the government's message as that of a third party. Yet, as <em>Johanns</em> demonstrates, the fact that a third party might not identify the government as the speaker does not change the fact that the government is speaking. In those situations where an observer might reasonably view the message as belonging to a third party instead of the government, the third party might bring an as-applied claim under the Court's compelled speech line of cases. The question of whether a third party is misidentified as the speaker of a government message, though, is separate and distinct from whether the message is that of the government. As Justice Thomas explained in his concurrence in <em>Johanns</em>, "the government may not, consistent with the First Amendment, associate individuals or organizations involuntarily with speech by attributing an unwanted message to them, whether or not those individuals fund the speech, and whether or not the message is under the government's control."</p>

<p>Second, the district court improperly contends that even if <em>Johanns</em> alters the <em>SCV/Rose</em> test, North Carolina's "Choose Life" plate still is unconstitutional under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15210508422263730617">Wooley v. Maynard</a>. In <em>Wooley</em>, the Court held that New Hampshire could not force the Maynards to carry the <em>government's</em> message, the state motto, on the State's <em>standard</em> issue license plate. In <em>Conti</em>, the district court concluded from this that "if, as <em>Wooley</em> suggests, standard license plates implicate private speech rights because of their association with the driver of a vehicle, then specialty plates provide an even closer association." But <em>Wooley</em> stands for the proposition that a private individual cannot be forced to involuntarily carry a <em>government</em> message. The Court did not require New Hampshire to stop using or even to modify the "Live Free or Die" plate because the plate's private speech discriminated against opposing viewpoints. Accordingly, the Court struck down only the part of the statute that prohibited covering up the motto because that provision "requires that [the Maynards] use their private property as a 'mobile billboard' for the <em>State's</em> ideological message." Unlike the standard issue plate in <em>Wooley</em>, however, North Carolina does not compel anyone to purchase and display the "Choose Life" specialty plate; instead, motorists voluntarily choose to display the State's message on their vehicles. As a result, <em>Wooley</em> does not govern the outcome in <em>Conti</em> because, instead of being forced to be "the courier for [the government's] message" as in <em>Wooley</em>, motorists consent to carrying the government's message and are actually willing to pay for the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Third, the district court ignores a central lesson of <em>Summum</em> &#8212; that the government does not lose the protection of the government speech doctrine simply because a private person, who assists the government in creating or disseminating its message, also seeks to engage in expressive activity. As <em>Summum</em> expressly acknowledges in its discussion of monuments, government speech may convey more than one message: "the thoughts or sentiments expressed by a government entity that accepts and displays [a monument] may be quite different from those of either its creator or its donor." Not surprisingly, then, those who observe a monument may interpret it in myriad ways, and even attribute a message to the donor, without causing the government to forfeit the protection of the government speech doctrine. The same is true for specialty license plates &#8212; the message that North Carolina seeks to convey through a specialty plate may differ from the message that motorists who voluntarily display that specialty plate on their vehicles seek to convey: "Even when a monument features the written word, the monument may be intended to be interpreted, and may in fact be interpreted by different observers, in a variety of ways." For example, North Carolina offers specialty plates with the emblems of both University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University. School license plates enable motorists to show their pride in or support for a particular school. In offering such specialty plates, the government does not advocate one school over another even though individuals choosing a specific college plate might do so. By approving specialty plates for many colleges and universities, North Carolina conveys a message about its diverse, well-educated citizens and champions the various educational opportunities that North Carolina offers to its citizens.</p>

<p>What is critical under <em>Johanns</em> and <em>Summum</em>, then, is not whether a third party can identify the government as the speaker but whether the government is actually speaking. Where the government "sets the overall message to be communicated and approves every word that is disseminated" or "has 'effectively controlled' the messages sent ... by exercising 'final approval authority' over the selection" of the message, it may claim the fundamental right protected by the Speech Clause &#8212; the right to choose the content of its message: "The fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment [is] that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message." As a result, contrary to <em>Rose</em> and the district court's order in <em>Conti</em>, if North Carolina has "effective control" over the "Choose Life" specialty plate and "final approval authority" over any message on such plates, then it can discriminate against particular viewpoints, issuing a "Choose Life" plate but not a "Respect Choice" plate.</p>

<p>Under <em>Johanns</em> and <em>Summum</em>, North Carolina exercises the requisite level of control over the "Choose Life" plate to qualify for the protection of the government speech doctrine. The North Carolina General Assembly has final approval authority over the images and wording that appear on all specialty plates, including the "Choose Life" plate through <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/enactedlegislation/statutes/pdf/bysection/chapter_20/gs_20-79.4.pdf">NC Gen. Stat. &#167; 20-79.4</a>. Moreover, the design of any proposed specialty plates "that are not 'First in Flight' plates must be approved by the Division and the State Highway Patrol for clarity and ease of identification." In addition, the State of North Carolina retains such control even over vanity plates, ie, plates that consist of a combination of letters and numbers chosen by a North Carolina motorist: "The Division may refuse to issue a plate with a letter combination that is offensive to good taste and decency." And, just as the General Assembly can create new specialty plates through legislation, it can revoke or amend any specialty plate through new legislation that is signed by the governor. Thus, because North Carolina exercises complete control over the specialty plate program, "no more is required."</p>

<p>As a result, when deciding whether to make the preliminary injunction permanent, the district court should apply the "control" test in <em>Johanns</em> and <em>Summum</em>, not the Fourth Circuit's multi-factor test in <em>SCV</em> and <em>Rose</em>. Under the Court's "newly minted" government speech doctrine, because the North Carolina legislature has final approval authority over all specialty plates, it can approve a "Choose Life" plate while declining the invitation to produce a "Respect Choice" plate. To the extent that plaintiffs or others disagree with this policy decision, they can exercise what <em>Summum</em> identifies as a primary check on disfavored legislative action &#8212; the political process: "And of course, a government entity is ultimately 'accountable to the electorate and the political process for its advocacy. ... If the citizenry objects, newly elected officials later could espouse some different or contrary position.'"<br />

Come what may, the legal structures of the 27 members have been irreversibly altered and "supranationalized." Another important message in a selection of these cases is that intellectual property (IP), the hegemonic ideology that has saturated the globe for the past two decades, has perhaps hit its peak. EU brakes on the excesses of IP have played out across the spectrum: in copyright, trademark and even patent law. Discussed below are two decisions regarding copyright, and its purpose and limitations under EU law. </p>

<p>To the outsider, the question arises as to how IP, an area of law overwhelmingly national in its structure and effects, comes before the ECJ, whose jurisdiction extends only to interpretation of EU law and not that of individual nations. The answer is that where national legislation is enacted in compliance with EU directives, those provisions in the national law can only be interpreted by the ECJ. Two recent copyright cases may be seen as indicative of a trend to interpret IP law through the lens of its original purpose &#8212; the benefit to society at large rather than corporate monopoly. </p>

<p>On November 24, 2011, in <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?where&lang=en&num=79888875C19100070&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET">Case C-70/10</a>, (<em>Scarlet Extended SA v Soci&#233;t&#233; belge des auteurs, compositeurs et &#233;diteurs SCRL [SABAM]</em>), the ECJ held that IP rights holders may apply to the Court for an injunction against intermediaries such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), "whose services are being used by a third party to infringe their rights." However, they could not obtain an injunction requiring an ISP to install a filtering system "which is capable of identifying on that provider's network the movement of electronic files containing a musical, cinematographic or audio-visual work in respect of which the applicant claims to hold intellectual property rights, with a view to blocking the transfer of files the sharing of which infringes copyright." This decision was based on their interpretation of five European Commission (EC) Directives and the relevant case law, and construed in light of Articles 8 and 10 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/005.htm">European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a>. </p>

<p>The Court cited Article 15 of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">Directive 2000/31</a> (on electronic commerce) which states:<br />
<blockquote>No general obligation to monitor:</p>

<p>1. Member States shall not impose a general obligation on providers, when providing the services covered by Articles 12, 13 and 14, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor a general obligation actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.</p>

<p>2. Member States may establish obligations for information society service providers promptly to inform the competent public authorities of alleged illegal activities undertaken or information provided by recipients of their service or obligations to communicate to the competent authorities, at their request, information enabling the identification of recipients of their service with whom they have storage agreements.</blockquote>Noting that "protection of the right to intellectual property is indeed enshrined in Article 17(2) of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/default_en.htm">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>, the judge stated that "There is, however, nothing whatsoever in the wording of that provision or in the Court's case-law to suggest that that right is inviolable and must for that reason be absolutely protected," (paragraph 43) and that "the protection of the fundamental right to property, which includes the rights linked to intellectual property, must be balanced against the protection of other fundamental rights." (Paragraph 44)</p>

<p>The Court found that "such an injunction would result in a serious infringement of the freedom of the ISP concerned to conduct its business since it would require that ISP to install a complicated, costly, permanent computer system at its own expense" contrary to Article 3(1) of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0048R(01):EN:HTML">Directive 2004/48</a>, which requires that measures to protect IP rights not be unnecessarily complicated or costly. (Paragraph 48)</p>

<p>Such an injunction would also infringe the fundamental rights of the ISP's customers to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information as protected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. (Paragraph 50)</p>

<p>Installation of the filtering system "would involve a systematic analysis of all content and the collection and identification of users' IP addresses from which unlawful content on the network is sent. Those addresses are protected personal data because they allow those users to be precisely identified." (Paragraph 51) </p>

<p>Such an injunction "could potentially undermine freedom of information since that system might not distinguish adequately between unlawful content and lawful content, with the result that its introduction could lead to the blocking of lawful communications." (Paragraph 52)</p>

<p>"[I]n adopting the injunction requiring the ISP to install the contested filtering system, the national court concerned would not be respecting the requirement that a fair balance be struck between the right to intellectual property, on the one hand, and the freedom to conduct business, the right to protection of personal data and the freedom to receive or impart information, on the other." (Paragraph 53)</p>

<p>Therefore, a national court is precluded from enjoining an ISP to install such a filtering system.</p>

<p>Less than a week later, on November 29, 2011, Advocate General Yves Bot, on a reference from a UK court, issued a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62010CC0406&lang1=en&type=NOT&ancre=">decision</a> rejecting copyright protection for the functionality and programming language of a computer program. (While Advocate General decisions are not binding on the Court, most judges follow their findings. It is thus likely but not certain that this decision will be affirmed by the Court in the near future.)  <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/fiche.jsf?id=C%3B406%3B10%3BRP%3B1%3BP%3B1%3BC2010%2F0406%2FP">Case C-406/10</a> (SAS Institute) dealt with an interpretation of the scope of legal protection conferred by copyright on computer programs under <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML">Directive 91/250/EEC</a>, and on works by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML">Directive 2001/29/EC</a>. </p>

<p>Article 5(3) of Directive 91/250 provides that the "person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, to observe, study or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do." </p>

<p>Defining the functionality of a computer program as "the set of possibilities offered by a computer system, the actions specific to that program. In other words, the functionality of a computer program is the service which the user expects from it" (paragraph 52), Bot held that such functionalities cannot "form the object of copyright protection under Article 1(1) of Directive 91/250." Citing the preparatory work for the Directive, he states that<blockquote>the main advantage of protecting computer programs by copyright is that such protection covers only the individual expression of the work and thus leaves other authors the desired latitude to create similar or even identical programs provided that they refrain from copying. This is particularly important because the number of available algorithms on which computer programs are based is considerable but not unlimited.</blockquote>Further, he says, "to accept that a functionality of a computer program can be protected as such would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."</p>

<p>In finding programming language to fall outside the protection of copyright, he compares it "to the language used by the author of a novel ... the means which permits expression to be given, not the expression itself."</p>

<p>It should also be noted that he finds the format of data files to be<blockquote>an integral part of its computer program. ... As part of the computer program, the interface &#8212; here, the elements which create, write and read the format of SAS data files &#8212; is therefore expressed in source code in the program. Consequently, if the expression of the interface constitutes a substantial part of the expression of the computer program ... it is eligible for copyright protection.</blockquote>That being said, however, he finds<blockquote>that the authorisation of the holder of copyright in a computer program is not to be required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4(a) and (b) of the directive are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs. This is known as decompilation.</blockquote>As an exception, Bot holds that it must be strictly construed and it is up to the national court to decide whether the conditions are met for the exception to apply.</p>

<p>With regard to protecting the SAS Manual, acknowledging that the manual itself is protected by copyright, "keywords, syntax, commands and combinations of commands, options, defaults and iterations from the SAS Manuals ... do not qualify for the protection conferred by copyright."</p>

<p>He goes on to conclude that<blockquote>reproduction, in a computer program or a user manual, of certain elements described in the manual for another computer program may constitute an infringement of the copyright in the latter manual if &#8212; a question which will be for the national court to determine &#8212; the elements reproduced in this way are the expression of their author's own intellectual creation.</blockquote>This limitation on the protectability of various aspects of computer programs would seem to mitigate against a warm reception in the EU to the notion of fully patentable software, which itself substantially limits the ability of rival entities to produce competing software. </p>

<p>While in the US, legislative activity in the area of IP in the controversial <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.03261:">Stop Online Piracy Act</a> (SOPA) currently winding its way through the Congress, seems to be going away from protection of fundamental rights, this decision would indicate that such rights may well take precedence over IP in the EU in the near future. At the level of international law, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-european-commission-announce.php">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> (ACTA) may well conflict with current EU law as well. </p>

Montana</em>. Paul Clement represented the petitioner, PPL Montana, while Gregory Garre argued on behalf of the respondent, the State of Montana.  In addition, Edwin Kneedler, Deputy Solicitor General, participated as <em>amicus curiae</em> for the US in support of the petitioner. The result was a spirited and informative three-way debate among the parties.</p>

<p>The case involved a dispute between the State of Montana and a power company over various submerged lands within the state. The controversy began in 2003 when a group of private citizens sued PPL in federal court, claiming that the power company should be required to compensate the state for the use of these submerged lands as sites for several of its hydroelectric power facilities. The case was eventually dismissed by the federal court on jurisdictional grounds. However, in 2004, PPL filed a declaratory judgment action against Montana in state court, claiming ownership of the beds beneath portions of the Upper Missouri, Clark Fork and Madison rivers. The trial court granted summary judgment for the state and decreed that PPL must pay millions of dollars in "back rent" for its unauthorized use of the state's land for its dam sites. This ruling was affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court. The case then came before the US Supreme Court as the result of a successful petition for a writ of <em>certiorari</em> by PPL.</p>

<p>Because the case will depend on whether the rivers in question are navigable, I will briefly discuss the tests for navigability and their relation to ownership of streambeds under state and federal law. Both federal and state courts distinguish between navigability for purposes of regulation and for purposes of determining title to streambeds. The power of the federal government to regulate navigable waters under the commerce clause is quite broad and may extend to non-navigable tributaries of navigable waters. Originally, in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14448268581382405388">United States v. Holt State Bank</a>, the Court held that waters are navigable for purposes of federal regulation if they are "used, or are susceptible of being used, in their natural and ordinary condition, as highways for commerce, over which trade and travel are or may be conducted in the customary modes of trade and travel on water."</p>

<p>However, this rule was later modified in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2918648694062082089">United States v. Appalachian Power Co.</a> to provide that waters could be deemed navigable for regulatory purposes if they could be made navigable through reasonable improvements even though these improvements had not been completed or even authorized. The subordination of private property rights to the federal power to regulate navigation is often <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14799549859514416959">referred</a> to as the "navigation servitude." State tests of navigability for regulatory purposes vary, but are roughly similar to the federal test. Notice that the power to regulate commerce and navigation on lakes, rivers and streams is not conditioned upon ownership of the beds below these waters.</p>

<p>The tests of navigability for title purposes are even more complex. According to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18306627545409107013">an early case</a>, when the US became independent each state held title to the beds of the navigable waters within its borders to be reserved for the common use of its citizens. Under the "equal footing" doctrine, states that were subsequently admitted to the Union succeeded to the same rights as the original 13 colonies. Consequently, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7953705403787887976">the Court held</a> that when the federal government acquired land from one of the original states or from a foreign country, it held the beds of navigable waters in trust for the benefit of new states. Thus, the beds beneath navigable waters were transferred to each state (subject to a public trust) upon its admission to the Union; on the other hand, the beds beneath non-navigable waters remained under federal ownership until it was transferred to the state or to private parties.  </p>

<p>In <em>PPL Montana</em>, the state maintained that the rivers in question were navigable where the dams were located when Montana was admitted to the Union in 1889 and, therefore, their beds belonged to the state. Consequently, PPL violated the state's property rights when it constructed dams on the beds of these rivers. On the other hand, PPL Montana alleged that the rivers in question were not navigable and that their beds had passed into private ownership by the time the power company's predecessors acquired them as sites for their hydroelectric power facilities in the early years of the twentieth century. More specifically, PPL Montana claimed that in the case of the Clark Fork and Upper Missouri rivers, the Montana court had considered the rivers in their entirety when deciding if they were navigable instead of focusing on the segments of the rivers where the dams were actually located. Furthermore, according to PPL Montana, although there were no obstructions in the Madison River, there was also no evidence that it had been used, or could have been used for navigation at the time of statehood. Instead, the Montana court improperly considered evidence of current recreational use to support its conclusion that the Madison River was navigable.</p>

<p>During the course of oral arguments, members of the Supreme Court covered a wide range of issues. However, the principal concern of the Court and the litigants was the proper test of navigability for title and its application to non-navigable portions of rivers and streams. In its brief, PPL Montana maintained that the Court in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9185026296758959006">United States v. Utah</a> had adopted a segmentation approach to navigability except for "<em>de minimis</em>," or negligible, interruptions. This prompted Justice Sonia Sotomayor to press for a more precise definition of the term "<em>de minimis</em>." Clement replied that the concept had been applied by the Court to determine whether small islands in navigable waters were transferred at statehood or whether they remained the property of the federal government. The nature of the lawsuit might also define what lands are <em>de minimis</em> and what lands are not. In this case, Clement argued that the submerged lands in question could not be considered <em>de minimis</em> since the State of Montana placed their rental value at more than $50 million. Finally, the area's topography was relevant to whether a portion of the bed was <em>de minimis</em> or not. A change in topography might mark the boundary of a new segment of the river.</p>

<p>A related issue was that of portage. Garre for the State of Montana argued that the proper test for navigability had been formulated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7361151155422303015">The Daniel Ball</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18093576063508233601">The Montello</a>, where the Court declared that streams or lakes were deemed to be navigable if they were used, or could be used, as "highways for commerce." According to Garre, a waterway that fit this definition would be treated as navigable in its entirety even if obstructions, such as shoals, rapids or waterfalls, required that passengers or cargo be removed from boats in order to get around them. However, Justice Anthony Kennedy suggested that the test of navigability proposed by the state, while suitable for delimiting the regulatory powers of the federal government, was not necessarily appropriate for determining what submerged lands a state owned within its territory.</p>

<p>Justice Samuel Alito raised an interesting question about the rationale for state ownership of submerged lands beneath navigable waters. Garre stated that ownership of the beds was necessary to protect navigation. However, Justice Alito responded that the states would not have to own the beds beneath non-navigable portions of a river or stream in order to protect navigation and commerce, since they were already obstructed. Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to agree with this analysis, declaring that keeping a river open for commerce was a weak justification if commerce was impossible over it. Both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Scalia also observed that it was not necessary for a state to own the beds beneath rivers and streams in order to protect navigation. It could do so through the exercise of its police power.</p>

<p>Justice Elena Kagan expressed concern that Montana would try to collect back rent from other riparian owners if the rule adopted by the Montana court was upheld. Garre conceded that this could happen, but only if a riparian owner was physically occupying the bed in some manner.</p>

<p>Finally, several Justices raised questions about the procedural posture of the case. For example, Justice Stephen Breyer suggested that the real dispute was between the US and the State of Montana since the petitioner's rights depended upon which governmental entity owned the beds beneath the three rivers in 1889. Justice Breyer suggested that it might be better to appoint a special master to take evidence as was done in other cases. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed that this seemed to be more of a dispute between the US and the State of Montana. Consequently, she expressed doubts about whether the Court should decide the case when the US was not a party. Another procedural issue was whether the trial court should have granted a summary judgment when there appeared to be a significant factual dispute about the rivers' navigability. Justice Sotomayor thought that the Court should address the question of whether summary judgment was appropriate in this case.</p>

<p>From the tone of the questioning, it seemed that most of the Justices were sympathetic to PPL Montana's position that the state should not own the beds of non-navigable portions of otherwise navigable rivers and streams. Nevertheless, some members of the Court also appeared to feel that the case might not be ripe for a decision. Accordingly, there are at least four options available. First, the Court could rule that the <em>Daniel Ball</em> and <em>Montello</em> "highway for commerce" test for navigability should be limited to regulatory cases and instead adopt a segmentation approach for title cases. Except where an obstruction to navigation was <em>de minimis</em>, the federal government or its successors in interest, not the states, would own the beds beneath non-navigable portions of a river. A less likely possibility is that the Court will reaffirm the application of the <em>Daniel Ball</em> and <em>Montello</em> decisions to title cases and conclude that Upper Missouri and Clark Fork rivers are highways for commerce throughout their entire length, notwithstanding the existence of rapids and other obstructions in some portions of these rivers.</p>

<p>If the Court chooses not to decide the case on the merits, it could vacate the decision of the Montana Supreme Court and require the State of Montana to invoke the Court's original jurisdiction to determine whether Montana or the US had title to the beds of the three rivers when Montana entered the Union in 1889. Finally, the Court could determine that summary judgment was improper and that the Montana Supreme Court's decision on this issue should be vacated and the case remanded for trial. Since the navigability issue is significant as well as interesting, hopefully the Court will choose one of the first two options and decide the Montana case on its merits. </p>

<p>The test for navigability based on <em>Utah v. United States</em> strikes a better balance between the interests of riparian owners and that of the states than the "highway of commerce" approach advocated by the State of Montana. The latter test, which originally applied to federal regulatory powers, rightly focuses protecting the right of members of the public to travel along a navigable river from Point A to Point B even though they may occasionally have to detour around rapids, shoals and other obstructions. However, when the "highway for commerce" test is applied to title cases, it upsets the settled expectations of riparian owners and confers a windfall on states by allowing them to demand millions of dollars in "back rent" for use of the beds. Instead, the Court should reaffirm its ruling in the <em>Utah</em> case and hold that titles to beds beneath non-navigable portions of a predominately navigable river or stream do not pass to the states under the equal footing doctrine. Furthermore, the Court should declare that portage is not evidence that a portion of the river is navigable, but rather it is evidence that it is not. Finally, because a river (or a portion thereof) must be navigable in fact at the time of statehood, the Court should require that one who submits evidence of present-day use, particularly recreational use, to prove navigability should also be required to show that the physical character of the river has not changed since that time. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=934">Chibli Mallat</a> of Harvard Law School says that the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces must divorce its economic power from its political power if it wants to avoid further protests and protect its economic interests...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/forum/chiblimallat.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>I</strong></font>t is probably too late. Too many people have already died at the hands of the self-appointed Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), the once self-styled servant of the Nile Revolution. Inside and outside Egypt, the growing perception is that the chairman of SCAF, Hussein Tantawi, is the same as Hosni Mubarak. </p>

<p>If SCAF refuses to relinquish political power and return soldiers to their barracks, things are bound to develop in one of two ways: either like Tiananmen Square, with hundreds of deaths and a repressive rule that only grows worse. Or the revolution prevails and the SCAF leadership ends up in a cell near the dozen top political inmates presently in the Tarra prison. In that case, a lot of people will have also died and the army as an institution might well collapse. This happened in Iran in 1978, and as is happening in Syria presently, with incalculable consequences in Egypt and the region. </p>

<p>For many, the disaster was inevitable. Around the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">collapse of Mubarak's regime</a> February 11, 2011, at lunch in Cambridge, my colleague Professor Duncan Kennedy showed a clear-headed skepticism of a "revolution" taken over by what looked very much like a junta's coup. Like Turkey, Latin America, even the US to some extent, the industrial-military complex must always be factored in the ruling power equation. It was obvious that the Egyptian military, at least since Gamal Abdel Nasser, was also an economic class. The continuity between Muhammad Naguib, who took power in 1952, Nasser in 1954, Anwar Sadat in 1970, Mubarak in 1980 and Tantawi in 2011, was structural, not conjunctural. It was called "the Revolutionary Command Council" in the new political-constitutional vocabulary of Egypt and copycat takeovers across the region. For Duncan Kennedy, the army cannot abandon its economic privileges. It will fight to keep them come what may.</p>

<p>I agreed with him about the risks, but surely something different has taken place in 2011 Egypt, which forced the army leadership to abandon Mubarak. Something was different, in large part because the revolution was nonviolent, and the army leadership was expressly saying that it was not interested in killing Egyptians, and that it would not carry out Mubarak or Vice President Omar Suleiman's orders to shoot at unarmed demonstrators. If it did, it knew it would end up like Mubarak. </p>

<p>So what, Duncan said, you could not expect them to abandon their privileges just because the people demonstrate in the street. He was proved right, as was Justice Adel Omar Sharif of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, who warned of the overbearing power of SCAF early on in a <a href="http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/whither-egypt/">memorable talk at Harvard Law School</a>. And yet, SCAF's ambivalence remains to date. When the army shot at unarmed Christian demonstrators in Maspero, rogue elements and a stampede were accused to have fomented the killing. Last week, when thousands rallied against SCAF in Tahrir and against the Mubarak-like Cabinet it appointed, the army unleashed more violence. Another apology came, together with a new twist: those in the street are anarchists guided by foreigners, the statements of the revolutionary command council declared. </p>

<p>I still think, however, that the outcome is not preordained when SCAF took over under the applause of the revolution the day Mubarak was forced out. One could and still can detect uncertainty in the leadership: a stream of apologies &#8212; "we are not like Mubarak, and his trial continues &#8212; is conflated with ridicule &#8212; 'it's all foreign-led to destroy Egypt.'" Meanwhile, the revolution is very much alive, and people have mobilized remarkably, with more demonstrations to come as SCAF and its appointed Mubarak-style government continue to lose legitimacy to the Islamists in the elections, and to the revolutionary street which fights to preserve the freedom gained against authoritarianism in 2011. </p>

<p>There is a solution to SCAF if it wants to dissociate its fate from Mubarak's. If the matter is one of pure power, there is nothing that can be done. If the dominant fear is the loss of its economic privileges, there is still a way out. A serious bargain can be struck with Egypt's revolutionary forces, including Islamists, liberals, students, women, judges, workers, etc., whereby the officers' economic privileges remain. In a rough calculation, whatever is considered the share of the budget for the officers' benefit &#8212; salaries, perks for the children, retinue, interests in various industries, real estate and barracks &#8212; can be kept as a reasonable constant value. As the economy of Egypt grows, this now huge imbalance of resources that goes to the army as an economic beneficiary will remain constant, with some adjustment for inflation. As the Egyptian economy grows, this constant share will increasingly become smaller in the successful, growing economy. Army privileges will remain tangible, but the imbalance in its share over the past 60 years in power will be slowly reduced in proportion to the economy. </p>

<p>How is it possible to strike such a bargain in the absence of reliable figures? Because the army's budget is secret and some of the officers run a parallel economy, the ratio of the military resources to the overall economic resources is unknown to the public. Depending on how perks are calculated, it probably varies between 20 and 40 percent of the overall gross domestic product (GDP). This is unsustainable in relative terms. It can be maintained while the rest of the economy grows, however. Over a period of one to three decades, it will slowly and increasingly look like the military budget of democratic countries, where the ratio is between one percent of GDP, as seen in Japan, and five percent as seen in the US.</p>

<p>So SCAF must fold, and it may be too late already, for unarmed demonstrators who have lost their dear ones in the repression are entitled to request judicial accountability, as they did for Mubarak. A small possibility remains for an orderly and reasonable retreat from bloodshed, which involves SCAF's more reasonable members, the large array of revolutionary forces, and those in the democratic world who want Egypt to continue leading the Middle East nonviolent revolution.</p>

The bill was HR 394, the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.394:">Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011</a> (JVCA), now Public Law No. 112-63. The JVCA will take effect on January 6, 2012. </p>

<p>The amendments made by the JVCA deal primarily with removal and venue. A detailed explanation of the statute, along with a comparison print that shows the changes from current law, can be found in the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt10/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt10.pdf">House Judiciary Committee Report</a> [PDF]. In this article I will note some highlights. A forthcoming article will discuss the unusual process that preceded the enactment of the bill, as well as some provisions that were included in earlier versions but were jettisoned along the way.</p>

<p>From a litigation perspective, the most important elements of the JVCA are those relating to removal jurisdiction and procedure. That is in part because removal legislation, unlike most other provisions in the Judicial Code, affects everyday practice in state as well as federal courts. That is particularly true today. Across a wide spectrum of claims and disputes, plaintiffs have a strong tendency to prefer state over federal court. Defendants prefer the federal forum. Defendants act upon their preference by removing cases that the plaintiff has filed in state court. The plaintiff, seeking to retain the state forum, files a motion to remand. Battles over removal thus <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1361892">occupy a central place in civil litigation today</a>. </p>

<p>Under the general removal statute, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_28_00001441----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 1441</a>, cases may be removed based on federal-question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction. The JVCA has only one provision on federal-question removal. This provision completely revises the notoriously troublesome "separate and independent" claim provision of &#167; 1441(c), dealing with the removal of civil actions that include both federal and unrelated state claims. The new law makes clear that the inclusion of unrelated state claims does not defeat removal that is otherwise proper based on the federal claims. It then requires severance and remand of claims not within the original or supplemental jurisdiction of the federal district court. This revision not only protects the defendant's right to remove; it also avoids the constitutional problems that some courts have perceived in the current provision. Although many commentators (including myself) initially preferred a simple repeal of &#167; 1441(c), I think the JVCA actually provides a better solution because it gives clear and straightforward directions to the district court for the situations within its coverage.</p>

<p>Several provisions of the JVCA deal with removal based on diversity jurisdiction. Note first that &#167; 1446, dealing with the procedure for removal, has been reorganized, and all of the provisions uniquely applicable to removal based on diversity are conveniently contained in a single subsection, &#167; 1446(c). Note too that notwithstanding the label "procedure," the "requirements" set forth in &#167; 1446(c) will often determine whether or not the defendant can successfully remove the case. They are thus particularly important to litigation practice. </p>

<p>Paragraph (1) of &#167; 1446(c) adopts a carefully crafted "bad faith" exception to the existing statutory provision that prohibits removal of a diversity case more than one year after filing. The one-year rule lent itself to abuse by plaintiffs &#8212; for example, as the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia observed in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4533596251202787872">Linnen v. Michielsens</a>, plaintiffs' attorneys would "include in diversity cases a non-diverse defendant only to non-suit that very defendant after one year has passed in order to avoid the federal forum." Some courts recognized an "equitable exception" to the one-year prohibition, while others regarded the rule as absolute. The newly enacted language gives district courts the authority to nullify blatant gamesmanship, but the exception is, as the House Report states, "limited in scope." How "limited" remains to be seen. </p>

<p>Paragraph (2) of &#167; 1446(c) resolves several issues relating to the determination of the amount in controversy when a case is removed based on diversity. This has been an extremely knotty aspect of practice, not least because, as I have observed elsewhere, "the plaintiff is in the anomalous position of seeking to minimize the value of the claim, while the defendant argues for the higher amount." The new statute adopts the "preponderance of the evidence" standard for contested cases and sets forth some procedures for determining whether the standard has been met. </p>

<p>These provisions of the JVCA resolve some conflicts in the lower courts, and for that reason are to be welcomed. But the statute's approach is less than ideal. The difficulty is twofold. First, it is always tricky to superimpose a handful of statutory procedures on a complex network of rules established through court decisions. Here there is the added challenge of codifying procedures that will integrate in a satisfactory way with the great variety of practices adopted by state systems for asserting and valuing claims. </p>

<p>For these reasons, at a hearing on a predecessor version of the JVCA, I suggested that the preferable approach would be for Congress to adopt the "preponderance" standard and authorize the Judicial Conference of the United States to use its rulemaking powers to devise the detailed procedures for determining whether the standard has been met. Congress did not take that path, but the Judicial Conference may have some limited authority here under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2072.html">Rules Enabling Act</a>. If the new law does generate conflicts in the lower courts, the Civil Rules Committee should consider whether to engage in rulemaking with respect to purely procedural issues. </p>

<p>Another provision of the JVCA deals with the removal of cases involving multiple defendants. This provision begins by codifying the judicially created "rule of unanimity": "all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action." But the unanimity rule applies only to cases removed "solely under &#167; 1441(a)." Thus it does not apply, for example, to removals under the federal-officer removal statute, &#167; 1442.</p>

<p>Codification of the rule of unanimity was only a preliminary step toward the main objective of this part of the legislation: resolving a longstanding conflict in the lower courts over the deadline for removal when different defendants are served at different times. The JVCA gives each defendant 30 days in which to initiate removal, thus putting all defendants on an equal footing. This has been the trend in the more recent cases, although in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5473516391972033616">Barbour v. International Union</a>, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the majority approach in a 2011 en banc decision that the JVCA has now abrogated. The new law also provides that if removal is initiated by a later-served defendant, earlier-served defendants may join in or consent to the removal.</p>

<p>The JVCA has only one provision specifically addressing original jurisdiction. That provision narrows the resident-alien proviso now located at the end of &#167; 1332(a). The purpose is to avoid the interpretative and even constitutional problems generated by the current language, which was added by a 1988 amendment to the Judicial Code.</p>

<p>Title II of the JVCA deals with venue and transfer. The new law completely rewrites Chapter 87 on venue, finally abolishing the hairsplitting distinction between backup venue in diversity and federal-question cases and also doing away with the separate provision dealing with "local" as opposed to "transitory" actions in &#167; 1392. The JVCA partially abrogates the Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15345056117313717082">Hoffman v. Blaski</a> by authorizing transfer of venue to a district where the action could <em>not</em> have been brought initially, as long as all parties consent.</p>

<p>The venue provisions of the JVCA are based in large part on the venue proposals of the 2004 Federal Judicial Code Project of the American Law Institute (ALI). The jurisdictional sections also draw on the ALI's work. Other elements of the JVCA are described in the House Report. </p>

<p>The JVCA states that its provisions will apply to newly filed actions starting 30 days after enactment. That makes the effective date January 6, 2012. For removed cases, the statute applies if the action has been "commenced, within the meaning of State law, in State court," after the effective date.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Maira Sheikh, <a href="http://law.nd.edu/">Notre Dame Law School</a> Class of 2012, is a Research Associate at the <a href="http://rsilpak.org/">Research Society of International Law</a> in Lahore, Pakistan. She discusses Pakistan's new women's rights laws and argues that even if these laws are not properly enforced, they are still valuable for the social progress they indicate as well as the empowerment they instill...<br /><hr height="1"><br /><table align="LEFT" cellpadding="0"cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/dateline/mairasheikh.jpg"align="LEFT"hspace="0" vspace="2"</td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="5"</td></tr><tr><td  colspan="2"><img src="/images/s.gif" height="1"width="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><font size="3"><strong>P</strong></font>akistan's track record for women's rights is dismal at best. A recent poll by the Thomson Reuters Foundation named Pakistan the third most dangerous country for women based on a documented history of acid attacks, child marriage, honor killings and rampant domestic violence. In recent years, the national government of Pakistan has made some effort to provide women with more rights by attempting to amend laws related to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+rape">rape prosecution</a> and by codifying anti-harassment laws for the workplace. On December 23, 2011, two new women's rights bills were passed by Pakistan's legislature amending the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html">Pakistan Penal Code</a> and the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/15/39849781.pdf?contentId=39849782">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>; the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1321415693_161.pdf">Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Bill</a> [PDF] and the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1302318969_628.pdf">Criminal Law Bill</a> [PDF] were both approved by the country's president.</p>

<p>The Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Bill adds a new chapter to the Pakistani Penal Code listing three particular offenses against women. Chapter XXA makes it unlawful to deprive a woman of her rightful inheritance through "deceitful or illegal means." This is punishable by imprisonment for five to 10 years with a possible additional fine of up to one million rupees. This chapter makes it unlawful to give or compel a woman into marriage for the purposes of settling a civil or criminal dispute. This is punishable by imprisonment for three to seven years along with a fine of five hundred thousand rupees. Finally, this chapter makes it unlawful to "compel or arrange or facilitate" a woman's marriage with the <a href="http://quran.com/">Qur'an</a>. This act is punishable by imprisonment for three to seven years as well as a fine of five hundred thousand rupees. The bill also amends the Pakistani Code of Criminal Procedure by making it unlawful for a provincial government to "suspend, remit, or commute" the sentences of those convicted of rape.  </p>

<p>The Criminal Law Bill makes bodily violence through the use of corrosive or acidic substances unlawful. It does this by amending Pakistan Penal Code Section 332's definition of "hurt" to include disfigurement and defacing, so that it now reads, "[w]hoever causes pain, harm, disease, infirmity or injury to any person or impairs, disables, disfigures, defaces or dismembers any organ of the body or part thereof of any person without causing his death, is said to cause hurt." Disfigurement is defined under this bill as the "disfigurement of face or disfigurement or dismemberment of any organ or any part of the organ of the human body which impairs or injures or corrodes or deforms the symmetry or appearance of a person." This bill makes it unlawful to cause or attempt to cause hurt through any substance that is corrosive or harmful to the human body upon internal or external contact. The definition of "corrosive substances" is fairly broad and includes anything which may "destroy, cause hurt, deface or dismember any organ of the human body and includes every kind of acid, poison, explosive or explosive substance, heating substance, noxious thing, arsenic or any other chemical which has a corroding effect and which is deleterious to the human body." Any act that violates this amendment is punishable by imprisonment of 14 years to life and a minimum fine of one million rupees. This bill is not gender specific; both men and women may be victims of bodily violence through corrosive substances. However, women are the primary beneficiaries of this bill as they are more frequently victims of this type of violence.  </p>

<p>The passage of these bills is hailed as a victory by female legislators and rights groups that have long pushed for increased legal rights and remedies for women. The victory, however, is only a small one. The proponents of these bills readily admit that laws decrease in value without proper enforcement and in Pakistan enforcement is a problem. Protecting women against the practices made unlawful by this legislation will be difficult and irregular, especially in regions where these practices are more commonplace. It may eventually be the case that relatively few convictions are sustained after appeal under these new laws. This wave of pro-women legislation is all fairly new and it is premature to evaluate its numerical impact on Pakistan's civil and criminal dockets. This does not mean that the value of these bills cannot be assessed independently of how many cases are adjudicated under them.  </p>

<p>The Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Bill and the Criminal Law Bill do not just pay lip-service to the increasing demand for women's rights in Pakistan. Regardless of whether or not these laws can ultimately be enforced, their existence alone is indicative of positive social progress. Such steps should not be undervalued, especially since only little more than 30 years ago the draconian <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/zia_po_1979/ord7_1979.html">Hudood Ordinances</a>, laws that left women making accusations of rape vulnerable to prosecution as adulterers, were passed. The Senate's unanimous passage of both the Anti-Women Practices Bill and the Criminal Law Bill and the quick approval thereafter by Pakistan's president indicate strong support for the women's rights movement by the current national government. This means that the national government is no longer satisfied with allowing the treatment of women to be guided mainly by local practices or outdated interpretations of religious custom. This kind of support for women's rights has yet to be demonstrated consistently at the local government level, and the specific provision prohibiting alteration of a rape conviction by provincial governments speaks to this shortfall. At the very least, the passage of these bills is an attempt to standardize the belief that women deserve to be treated in a manner that preserves their dignity and their rights as human beings. For enforcement to eventually occur in a consistent and meaningful manner, people's beliefs need to evolve to a point where these newly prohibited practices are genuinely considered intolerable by the vast majority of Pakistanis. It is only then that women will no longer be at the mercy of their fate, whether born into homes where they are valued as property, as princesses or as anything in between. </p>

<p>These women's rights bills are also valuable for the empowerment and self-worth they encourage within Pakistani females. The eventual impact of these laws on society will be insignificant without the development of female empowerment through basic education and education on rights granted to females as citizens of Pakistan, rights that ultimately supersede regional, cultural or religious practices. Women, especially those that live in communities that most offend women's rights, must teach one another to stand up for themselves and to seek legal remedies when their rights have been violated. The knowledge that there are laws that prohibit practices such as forced marriage for the settlement of disputes or marriage to the Qur'an give women the power and the platform to say "no." For now, that "no" may go unheard or it may be met with an unsavory response, but empowerment means that "no" will become louder and more frequent as women discover that these practices are not the norm and are, in fact, illegal and unacceptable.</p>

<p>Pakistan's social climate is slowly improving, as outdated and undignified practices that are harmful to women are being suppressed. Only time will tell if these new laws are truly successful in providing women with enforceable legal rights and in curbing bodily violence through corrosive substances. For the time being, the measurable value of the Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Bill and the Criminal Law Bill is in the social progress they indicate and the empowerment they bestow.</p>
