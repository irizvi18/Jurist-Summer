		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On 03 January, the US <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/01/us-drone-strike-kills-top-iran-military-commander/">launched</a> a drone strike against the Iranian defence chief Qasem Soleimani. The strike occurred while Soleimani was in Iraq and it killed both the general and a number of other personnel in the area, including Iraqis. The event raises questions that touch on various aspects of international law. For example, there is the question of whether the US was acting in self-defence – as it has suggested – in response to earlier attacks such as that against the US embassy in Baghdad and in deterrence of anticipated future attacks. There is also the question of the violation of Iraq’s sovereignty which accompanies the action which took place within its borders and yet without its consent. These are undoubtedly important legal issues and much has been, and will continue to be, said about them.

However, there is another question which is seemingly a little off-piste compared to current media discourse. That is the significance of recent events in terms of the law of armed conflict (also known today as international humanitarian law and, formerly, as the law of war). Does this strike trigger the application of LOAC? If so, who are the parties? What regulations does LOAC impose on the conduct of those parties? These are important questions too, even if not as headline-grabbing as the right to use force or the violation of state sovereignty.

On the first point of whether the strike triggers the application of LOAC, the answer is a qualified ‘yes’. The US attack may, alone, trigger a war, or an ‘international armed conflict’ to use the <em>mot juste</em>, between the US and Iran. This is not terribly difficult to establish given that the threshold for an IAC is very low. All that is required under <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/365-570005">Common Article 2</a> of the Geneva Conventions 1949 is that there is an ‘armed conflict’ ‘between two or more of the High Contracting Parties’. According to the ICTY in <a href="https://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/acjug/en/tad-aj990715e.pdf"><em>Tadic</em></a>, the violence need only amount to ‘armed force’ with no particular minimum intensity requirement. Certainly a missile strike against a military general would qualify. In terms of the inter-state element, there is no doubt here that we are dealing with states as opposed to non-state groups or individuals. Indeed, we can clearly see from <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/375-590007?OpenDocument">Article 4</a> of Geneva Convention III that we have the archetypal exchange between ‘members of the armed forces’. However, the ‘yes’ is qualified – and the effect of this particular strike all rather moot – because there was already an IAC in existence on the basis of earlier exchanges between the US and Iran. Those were each capable of triggered the application of LOAC in their own right too. Still, the recent action helps to solidify the fact that an IAC is in place between the US and Iran.

On the second point of the parties to the conflict, clearly the US and Iran are involved. That said, for the same reasons as given above, the strike also triggers, legally, an IAC between the US and Iraq as it was violence perpetrated by the former on the territory of the latter without its consent. That said, it is unlikely that, politically, the US or Iraq have the appetite for (yet another) war.

On the third point, moving back to the US and Iran IAC, the short answer to the question of what regulations LOAC imposes is … ‘a lot’. The regime surrounding IACs is long-established and highly detailed. It can be contrasted in this regard with the comparatively juvenile regime in place for non-international armed conflicts which governs violence between states and non-state (rebel) armed groups (or violence between two or more such groups). It would be unrealistic to give a full account of the applicable rules of the IAC regime here. That said, it is worth noting a few points of immediate significance.

Firstly, given that an IAC is in place between the US and Iran, it is legitimate under LOAC for either side to target and kill members of the opposition’s armed forces. That is, after all, the expectation in war as set out in the principle of distinction/targeting which can be found at <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750061?OpenDocument">Article 48</a> of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. The shock in this case seems to have resulted from the fact that both sides have thus far been engaging in comparatively low-intensity, often indirect, strikes in an attempt to avoid acknowledging the existence of a ‘war’. This is an increasingly common, and perhaps understandable, strategy. However we can see here that it has come at the cost of clarity for the actors – in their own minds, not in the law – about the nature of the game they are playing. It is war.

Secondly, we have seen inflammatory language from Iran to the effect that it will wreak ‘crushing retaliation’ on the US and, in response, the US has suggested that it might even respond ‘disproportionately’. On this point, we must appeal to both sides to remember that the need to act ‘proportionately’ at all times in war is an absolutely key requirement of the law. Actions must always be measured rather than extreme. This requirement is best expressed in Articles <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/470-750039?OpenDocument">32</a>, <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/470-750065">51</a> and <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/9ac284404d38ed2bc1256311002afd89/50fb5579fb098faac12563cd0051dd7c">57</a> of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. In essence, the rule is that the collateral damage resulting from an attack must not exceed the military gain garnered from it. Hopefully, both sides were engaging in political rhetoric when making these remarks and we will not see the tenor of the comments transposed onto the battlefield. Nonetheless, language should be chosen carefully.

Thirdly, there was a suggestion that sites ‘important to … Iranian culture’ may be hit in future US strikes. This language was evidently vague and the potential targets were not divulged so it is impossible to say whether or not attacks against them would be legal. However, it should be borne in mind that ‘cultural property’ (if that is indeed what was referred to) benefits from a detailed regime of bespoke protection comprised of treaties such as the <a href="http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html">Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property 1954</a> and its protocols. The regime is by no means perfect and it is certainly not true to say that cultural property is immune from attack in any situation. However, it is not promising to see it singled out for destruction in this way. The appalling damage caused by ISIS to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2015/05/eu-foreign-policy-chief-expresses-concern-over-potential-war-crimes-in-palmyra/">Palmyra</a> should be seen as a wake-up call, not a blueprint.

		<title>Can the US Justify its Position as a Right to Self-Defense and can President Trump be Prosecuted for the Crime of Aggression?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>One of the underlying rationales of the UN Charter, as highlighted in its preamble, is to ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind’. Any obvious statement in regards to Iran’s immediate reaction would be immature; however, it can be reasonably established that the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani awaits untold sorrows that may have grave repercussions short of the World Wars.</span>

<span>The assassination of Iran’s top military general by President Donald Trump’s authorized drone strike on Thursday night raises a critical global concern. Its political implications may be severe enough to change the course of history.  The important question to address would be the legal justifications for such an act.  </span>

<span>The Pentagon and the White House were clear in their statement: the strike was directed by President Trump as a decisive defensive measure to ‘protect’ U.S personnel. Their statement seems to engage the international law justification of self-defense which is the only exception to the prohibition on the use of force under the UN Charter. Otherwise, both the customary international law  and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force <em>(see Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (ICJ) 1986, para 74).</em></span>

<span>Before I deal with the question of self-defense, the matter requires a quick look into Iraq’s sovereignty and legal obligations to General Soleimani. This topic itself requires another article; however, a brief discussion over here would be suffice to provide an overview. A limited number of state representatives are so closely tied to the sovereignty of the state that they enjoy particularly extensive protection. The major legal protection offered is diplomatic immunity. General Soleimani was a representative of Iran. As a second most powerful figure in Iran, General Soleimani attracted a greater diplomatic value. In other words, his official status represented the sovereignty of Iran. </span>

<span>Therefore, depending on the details of his presence in Iraq, he was entitled to diplomatic immunity guaranteed by the customary international law and the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Iraq’s failure to protect General Soleimani will be a manifest breach of the laws of diplomatic immunity. The reaction of Iraqi official suggests that they were unaware of the assassination. Therefore, it raises the legal question of the breach of Iraqi sovereignty. If the assassination were carried without Iraq’s permission, the US would be liable for the breach of Iraqi sovereignty and the diplomatic immunity of its guests. However, a manifest right to self-defence may change the nature of such legal arguments. </span>

<strong><span>The Right to Self </span></strong><b>Defense</b>

<span>The right to self-defense is an inherent right under customary international law and article 51 of the UN Charter.  There has been extensive controversy as to the precise extent of the right to self-defence. Before 2001, the right to self-defense was only available against the use of force of another state. However, after the rise of terrorism, States can now rely on the right to self-defense against non-state actors.</span>

<span>General Soleimani was a military General representing the Islamic Republic of Iran. Per the secondary rules of International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, conducts of any state organ or official entities are attributed as an act of the State<em>(see Articles: 4, 5,6 &amp; 7).</em> Therefore, he cannot be regarded as a non-state actor. To rely on the self-defense for its use of force against General Soleimani, the President Trump administration has to fulfill the criteria’s essential for the right to self-defense.</span>

<span>Firstly, the right to self-defense is triggered by ‘an armed attack’; secondly, customary international law requires that self-defense would warrant only measures which are proportionate to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it <em>(see Nicaragua case 1986 para 94; and The Caroline case 1837).</em> </span>

<span>Thus, the US has to connect any armed attack to Iran. The armed attack must be of certain intensity to trigger a right to self-defense and not all uses of force prescribed by article 2(4) qualify. Case law suggests that only acts producing or likely to produce very serious consequences, such as territorial invasions, human fatalities or massive destruction of property will suffice to constitute an armed attack that triggers a right to self-defense<i>. (see Oil Platforms case (Iran v USA ) ICJ 2003; the 1996 Advisory Opinion on the Use of Nuclear Weapons; and Nicaragua Case).</i> Hence, while a state that fears a potential attack from another state may make its own military preparations in anticipation of the attack and bring the matter to the attention of the Security Council, it may not resort to any measures of self-defense until the attack takes place. There is the exception of anticipatory self-defense which is only available when the threat is imminent, unlikely to apply here. The acts committed by General Soliemani or Iran can either not be attributed directly to Iran or cannot be categorized as armed attacks.</span>

<span> President Trump, in his tweets, attributes the loss of thousands of Americans to General Soleimani. Although a bold statement, there is little evidence to prove. Since the US withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal in May 2018, the US and its allies have contributed several armed attacks to Iran. The recent ones include 14 September 2019 attacks on Saudi Arabia oil facilities which the Houthi Movement took responsibility as a retaliation for Saudi airstrikes on Yemen. The UN was unable to confirm Iran’s involvement. On the other hand, there was also no evidence of Iran's involvement in 19th May 2019 rocket attack near the US embassy in Baghdad in which no one was harmed. The only attributed act that harmed US property was the 20th June shooting down of US Drone which Iran claims was flying over Iranian air space; the shooting down of US Drone cannot constitute an armed attack if it were flying over Iran’s air space. On the contrary, Iraq is responsible for the safety of the US embassy in light of recent protest. It was well established by ICJ in Tehran Hostages case, that States are responsible for the diplomatic protection of diplomats on its premises from its citizens<em> (see Tehran Hostage case (USA v Iran) ICJ 1981, para 67)</em>. </span>

<span>Even if a strong argument for an armed attack attributing to Iran is made, the customary international law requirements of proportionality and necessity set a high threshold undermining the US claim of right to self-defense. The necessity requirement requires that the armed attack occurred or is reasonably believed to be imminent, requiring the essential response proposed. Similarly, the response has to be proportionate; proportionality also requires the consideration of the type of weaponry to be used. It is unclear what event the US can use as a necessity but the killing of General Soleimani cannot be held as a proportionate response.</span>

<strong><span>Iran’s legal Options: Can Trump be prosecuted for the crime of aggression? </span></strong>

<span>Iran has the conventional right to self-defense and can use force. There is also a peaceful remedy that Iran can avail through the routes of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC).  It can demand reparation against the US in the ICJ. On the other hand, Iran may request the ICC to prosecute President Donald Trump for the crime of aggression. Aggression is a crime under the Rome statute which by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the UN (<em>see Rome Statute Article 8bis(2)).</em> The crime of aggression is limited to the absolute leadership of a State. Article 13 of the Rome Statute gives the ICC leniency on establishing its jurisdiction. ICC can establish its jurisdiction, if the crime is referred to the Prosecutor by the State Party to the Rome Statute; By the Security Council; or if the Prosecutor initiates an investigation in respect of such crime. Neither the US nor Iran and Iraq are parties to the Rome Statute, the statute establishing ICC; therefore, ICC can only prosecute President Trump if the Security Council authorizes or the Prosecutor arbitrarily initiates investigation. A prominent example available to us is that of Sudan’s former President Omar Al Bashir, who was investigated by the ICC for war crimes as a sitting President at the request of the Security Council. Nevertheless, Iran’s success in prosecuting President Trump at ICC is very unlikely, but the doors of ICJ are open so is the right to use force.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Writing in the New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/opinion/soleimani-iran-tom-cotton.html">U.S. Senator Tom Cotton</a> argued that President Donald Trump’s decision to kill Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was legally justified in three ways: under Article II of the Constitution, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf">2001 Authorization to Use Military Force</a> aimed at those responsible for the September 11 attacks, and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ243/PLAW-107publ243.pdf">2002 Authorization to Use Military Force Against Iraq</a>. In fact, each of these legal justifications for the killing of Soleimani is suspect. As Ryan Goodman and Steve Vladeck <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/67993/why-the-2002-aumf-does-not-apply-to-iran/">have argued</a> in Just Security, no reasonable interpretation of the 2002 AUMF supports the use of force against Iran or an Iranian citizen in Iraq. And, notwithstanding Cotton’s belief that Article II “provides ample legal basis for” the strike against Soleimani, the administration has yet to explain clearly (at this writing) why Soleimani posed the kind of incipient threat necessary to trigger the president’s inherent authority under Article II to defend the nation and its citizens.

This leaves Cotton – and the president – with the 2001 AUMF. By its terms, this law authorizes the president “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.” Relying upon this language, three successive presidential administrations have claimed the authority to pursue offensive military actions far removed from the Afghan frontier where members of al Qaeda responsible for the September 11 attacks were hiding. Indeed, the 2001 AUMF has been used to justify such operations as the deployment of drone strikes against terrorist suspects located nowhere near Afghanistan; special forces missions in the Middle East and North Africa; and, in 2017, the airstrikes President Trump ordered against targets in Syria.

Liberal executive interpretations of the 2001 AUMF have come under criticism repeatedly in recent years. Following the killing of Soleimani, Representative Joe Kennedy III called for the repeal of the force resolution. His arguments echo those made in 2018 by then-Senator Jeff Flake and Senator Tim Kaine, who sought to revisit the AUMF in light of the lengths to which presidents have stretched its terms. Indeed, back in 2018, writing in The Hill, we supported this position, concluding that “the strongest and most urgent reason to support the effort by Sens. Flake and Kaine is to preserve Congress’s institutional legitimacy when it comes to national security.”

We continue to believe that Congress must assert its constitutional role in national security matters. The Constitution makes clear that the framers contemplated roles for both Congress and the president in determinations whether to use force abroad: Congress has the power to authorize and fund military engagements, while the president, serving as commander-in-chief, directs those forces and their deployment. What the framers did not spell out, of course, is precisely how Congress and the president should operationalize their shared responsibilities—particularly in a world in which threats may come from non-state actors. Practical considerations suggest the president should take the lead, as modern presidents have: the chief executive is possessed of the resources necessary to gather and analyze intelligence, and has the institutional ability to act quickly. On the other hand, the allocation of the war power to Congress suggests the framers understood that the members of the legislature, precisely because they are closer to the people than the occupant of the Oval Office, are positioned both to appreciate the potential human consequences of military action and to serve as an effective check on the executive’s discretion in national security matters.

At the same time, however, Congress – especially today – may well be institutionally incapable of the very kind of decision making that the use of force in all its immediacy requires. Indeed, were Congress to repeal the 2001 AUMF, there is a non-zero possibility that it would be replaced by nothing. Presidents subsequently would see themselves as free to act unilaterally in many instances, relying upon ever-expanding claims of inherent authority under Article II to justify their actions. At least the 2001 AUMF, broad and vague though it may be, provides a textual benchmark by which Congress – and the American people – can assess the validity of a president’s claim to be exercising American military might under its auspices.

In other words, while presidents will no doubt continue to stretch the words in the 2001 AUMF to justify the military actions they deem appropriate, it remains that the text of the force resolution cannot possibly authorize all the actions in which a president might wish to engage. This isn’t just about lawyerly quibbles: no reasonable person would agree that the 2001 AUMF permits, for example, a ground war in Iran based upon Iran’s missile attacks on U.S. positions in Iraq in response to Soleimani’s death. There simply is no logical or temporal connection between the September 11 attacks and these Iranian missile strikes in 2020.

Part of the continuing value of the 2001 AUMF, then, is that it marks the extent to which Congress elected to give the president the discretion to pursue the nation’s anti-terrorism agenda using military force without having to return to Congress for permission to target every “nation, organization, or person he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks.” That kind of authorization made sense in 2001. And the text of the 2001 AUMF indicates that, however capaciously it might be interpreted, there are places and actions it does not reach. Those restrictions are not likely judicially enforceable, but they can be politically potent as means by which Congress and the American people can make determination about whether and when a president has gone too far.

		<title>AI and the Auteur: Implications of Using Artificial Intelligence in Film Studio Decision-Making</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The global movie industry <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/252730/leading-film-markets-worldwide--gross-box-office-revenue/">generated</a> over $43 billion in revenue in 2018, of which the United States’ contribution alone topped more than $11 billion. Yet, these seemingly impressive headline figures can obscure the fact that year-on-year growth has been a sluggish 2 per cent over the last several years, with market researchers forecasting further stagnation. Given the inherent financial risk involved in film making, some now believe artificial intelligence, rather than human expertise, is best placed to select which films are most likely to provide suitable returns on investment.

In early January 2020, Warner Bros signed a deal with Cinelytic, a Los Angeles-based artificial intelligence company which, according to the press release, aims to help content creators make faster, better-informed decisions through predictive analytics. Belgium’s ScriptBook provides a similar service, touted as “artificially intelligent script analysis and box office forecasting”. Warner Bros is not the first film studio to pair up with an AI platform of this type, although it is one of the first to disclose its collaboration publicly.

<strong>From script to screen: the greenlighting process and how AI may help</strong>

Greenlighting is the process by which a studio formally approves a film’s production. The greenlighting decision must take into account not only the initial financing and advertising costs, but the potential for merchandising, licensing, spin-offs, and even theme parks. This process often involves committees comprised of several top executives, not least because of the eye-watering budgets allocated to some endeavors. By way of illustration, the three most recent Avengers films collectively cost over $1 billion to produce. With producers facing increased competition to choose revenue generating, award-winning projects, Hollywood is now turning to artificial intelligence to provide valuable insight regarding which films are likely to be blockbusters – or flops.

In practice, services like Cinelytic and ScriptBook work by mining and analyzing keywords attributable to a film’s themes, dialogue, and actors, with some also offering to analyse the scripts themselves. These data are then fed through machine learning processes to determine certain trends and patterns, and cross-referenced with box office performance, critical reception, and industry awards statistics. When taken together with information such as a celebrity’s popularity in a given region, AI can help streamline the production pipeline and assist studios with choosing anything from actors, plot elements, and marketing strategies. Despite obvious benefits however, there are certain potential drawbacks which cannot be overlooked. From the perspective of the author, three key risks seem particularly apparent, namely: the inability to account for outliers; impedance to diversity and inclusion; and denigration of human creativity.

<strong>Risk One: Imperfect Predictions and Liability</strong>

Firstly, learning from the past does not mean that you can accurately predict the future. Machine learning algorithms rely on sample “training” data in order to build mathematical models. As with any form of statistical modelling, there are always outliers which cannot be accurately forecasted. It is arguable that many classic films could have been flagged as likely ‘failures’ by the likes of Cinelytic and Scriptbook, and therefore refused the proverbial green light in their day. Conversely, it is not unusual for a big-ticket production to flop despite using the best talent in the industry. Take the 1982 film Blade Runner as an example. Despite starring leading man Harrison Ford – who by then had already achieved fame thanks to his roles in Star Wars and Indiana Jones – the film received only mixed reviews and grossed a paltry $33 million against its $28 million budget. The Shawshank Redemption and Fight Club are two more recent examples of films that suffered poor box office performance, but have since endeared themselves to audiences the world over.

From a legal perspective, alarmism over AI-assisted forecasting is somewhat passé. Although these platforms have the potential to disrupt the industry using a relatively new technology, it is unlikely that their contractual terms of supply will differ greatly from more traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) agreements. In both cases, suppliers of technology solutions – whether machine learning or otherwise – will want to exclude as much liability as possible for any erroneous or incomplete predictions. Likewise, film studios seeking to benefit from the algorithmic output will want to ensure adequate service levels and ultimately, sufficient value for money. In any event, the studios will need to take a commercial view as to how much weight to ascribe any AI-generated predictions and analysis provided, and at what cost.

<strong>Risk Two: Bias and the Rights of the Data Subject</strong>

A second key concern of using AI in the film industry is that of bias and perpetuated stereotypes. Predictive analytics could be run against a variety of factors concerning potential actors, screenwriters, and directors: such characteristics could include one’s gender, age, race, ethnicity, disability or impairment, sexual orientation, and so on. As we have seen from studies on machine learning in the criminal justice context, algorithms can perpetuate <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">human biases</a>. It is foreseeable that the AI could become path dependent, err on the side of caution, and fail to account for cultural shifts in audience attitudes. For instance, of the top 100 top grossing movies made between 2017 and 2018, only 33 per cent of all speaking or named characters were girls or women. If this metric were analysed in isolation, it is not impossible to consider that a machine learning algorithm would lean towards viewing male protagonists as a safer choice for higher profits. As Norwegian filmmaker Tonje Hessen Schei <a href="https://www.screendaily.com/news/can-ai-help-the-film-industry/5145193.article">told</a> Screen Daily, a concern with this new process is that it may become “harder and harder to get a diverse span of voices that will be heard in the market.”

The legal implications or responses on this point are somewhat unclear. To date, the primary concerns of United States lawmakers with respect to AI decision-making have been in the area of autonomous vehicles, including weaponised aerial drones. While the Federal Trade Commission has issued recommendations that promote principles of lawfulness and fairness, no specific legislation exists to protect individuals against AI-enabled discrimination. It does however stand to reason that in the employment context, automated decisions which adversely impact those of protected classes may violate extant anti-discrimination laws.

By contrast, under European Union data privacy law (namely the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a>) a European resident has the right to ‘meaningful information about the logic involved’ in automated decisions. In other words, European legislation recognises that individuals may be entitled to an explanation concerning the output of an algorithm which directly impacts them. However, this only bites in very limited circumstances, in instances where decisions are made automatically without any human intervention. At present, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a casting decision (for example) would be made wholly independently of a human executive’s final consideration and approval.

<strong>Risk Three: Creativity and Copyright in the age of AI Authorship</strong>

The movies capture a very particular space in the human imagination. They can be used to elevate storytelling to incredible heights of fantasy, as well as to cast a spotlight on those narratives and factual events which would otherwise be overlooked. For that reason, the third and perhaps most philosophical issue arises from our collective understanding that cinema is an inherently human art form. Despite the fact that the development of theoretical frameworks and financial models to predict box office performance is nothing new, to what extent are we amenable to involving computers in the process? On the one hand, audiences and critics alike applaud computer-generated special effects. We are also becoming increasingly comfortable with artistic usage of digital de-ageing and deepfaking of celebrities. But we seem to struggle with the idea of technology transitioning from artist’s tool, to an autonomous authority in the creative process.

Scriptbook’s website exclaims that its platform is progressing towards “co-creation between man and machine [in] the era of AI as a co-writer”. While many will be aware of the often nonsensical (and indeed humorous) outputs of some AI chatbots, in 2016 a film director and AI researcher trained a machine-learning system using classic science fiction screenplays including Avatar, Minority Report, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The result was a nine-minute short film entitled Sunspring which went on to win an award at the Sci-Fi London Film Festival. Needless to say, as the sophistication of machine learning continues to improve, deals such as the one between Warner Bros and Cinelytic give rise to fascinating philosophical questions of originality, creativity, and even ontology.

Legal academics and practitioners alike have been considering the legal implications of computer-generated works for decades. Undoubtedly, works created using AI could have very important implications for copyright law. Importantly, in many jurisdictions including the United States and the United Kingdom, current copyright law prevents authorship from vesting in non-human creators. But by extrapolation, such works could theoretically be deemed free of copyright protection and – problematically for film studios – fall into the public domain. Some scholars and policymakers suggest a reimagining of the work-for-hire doctrine to alleviate this problem, which would grant copyright to the person(s) operating the AI in the first instance.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Of course, the use of AI in the film industry is only one example of how human behavior and cultural trends can be studied through the quantitative machine analysis of digitized text. And clearly, there are many ethical and related legal risks that must be considered by a business using AI, regardless of sector. In this increasingly dynamic market, the full implications of artificial intelligence in the film industry are likely to remain opaque for the foreseeable future. But if AI used behind the scenes can help film industry stakeholders create more binge-worthy series and award-winning feature films, audiences are likely to be happier, even if the “movie magic” is more algorithm, less auteur.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Abstract:</strong> Although US President Donald Trump may eventually be content with achieving only modest operational successes against Iran, there is reason to believe he would still prefer some notion of a military "victory." Any such notion would likely be starkly injurious to overall US security interests. Derivatively, as shall now be argued, any such erroneous notion could also be harmful to Israel, a principal US ally in the region.

"Every battle is won before it is fought."
Sun Tzu, <em>The Art of War</em>

In planning its core strategic policy, the United States should always be guided by coherent <a style="cursor: help" title="Formal doctrine is the required framework from which proper strategic goals should be suitably extrapolated. Generically, in 'standard' or orthodox military thinking, such doctrine describes the tactical manner in which national forces ought to fight in various combat situations, the prescribed 'order of battle,' and variously assorted corollary operations. The literal definition of 'doctrine' derives from Middle English, from the Latin doctrina, meaning teaching, learning, and instruction. Always, a central importance of codified military doctrine lies not only in the way it can animate, unify and optimize pertinent military forces, but also in the way it can transmit certain desired 'messages' to an enemy.">doctrine</a>. If, however, for any reason, this antecedent doctrine were wrongly <a style="cursor: help" title="One core component of any such doctrine must concern preemption or 'anticipatory self-defense.' The precise origins of anticipatory self-defense in customary law lie in The Caroline, a case that concerned the unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. Following this case, the serious threat of armed attack has generally justified certain militarily defensive actions. In an exchange of diplomatic notes between the governments of the United States and Great Britain, then U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster outlined a framework for self-defense that did not require an antecedent attack. Here, the jurisprudential framework permitted a military response to a threat so long as the danger posed was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.'">conceived</a>, its net effect could prove markedly negative. More particularly, for the current President of United States to continue to approach America's most insistently urgent security challenges ad hoc, or viscerally, without any proper theoretical <a style="cursor: help" title="On this foundation, consider the elucidating metaphor that theories are 'nets.' This metaphor is correctly attributed to the German poet Novalis, and cited by Karl Popper as the epigraph to his The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959). The poet's exact words, according to Popper, are: 'Theories are nets; only he who casts, will catch.'">foundation</a>, would be sorely mistaken.

<em>Grievously </em>mistaken.

Going forward, the only correct strategic stance for President Donald Trump regarding Iran should be twofold: (1) forge and identify an appropriately underlying strategic doctrine; and (2) take all possible steps to ensure that this indispensable doctrine will be lawful and net-gainful/advantageous. In the matter of Iran, this means "winning" specific "battles," but without seeking any overall military victory. Though this counsel may at first sound self-contradictory or counter-intuitive, it is actually indispensable.

This is because any search for a traditional victory in this theatre could place even the plainly "stronger" state adversary in a position of irrecoverable harm.

If planned prudentially, United States strategic doctrine vis-à-vis Iran would carefully exclude any manifestly implausible goals. Achieving some sort of determinable victory over Iran would represent just such a futile goal. To clarify further, a more precise set of explanations is immediately in order.

More than anywhere else in America's geopolitical universe, except perhaps for North Korea, the US president's enhanced doctrinal focus should be laser-focused on Iran. Following recent new year events in Iraq, beginning with the US-ordered <a style="cursor: help" title="For the important legal distinctions between assassination and targeted killing, see: Amos N. Guiora, Legitimate Target: A Criteria-Based Approach to Targeted Killing (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 107 pp.">assassination</a> of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, President Donald J. Trump is apt to seek some sort of larger “victory” over Iran. Though his favored operational stance is more likely to be incremental than some sudden or “bolt-from-the-blue” American strike, there will still remain assorted and <a style="cursor: help" title="Where these intersections are also synergistic - that is, where the totality of effects is calculably greater than the tangible sum of component effects - the expected consequences would be correspondingly more severe.">intersecting</a> dangers of an uncontrolled escalation. Furthermore, the two adversarial states, assuming a mutual and reciprocal rationality, will pursue essentially the same principal objective, and - contextually - within the same "<a style="cursor: help" title="International law remains a 'Westphalian' or 'vigilante' system. The reference here is to the Peace Of Westphalia (1648), which concluded the Thirty Years War and created the now still-existing decentralized or self-help state system of world politics. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.">Westphalian</a>" system of world politics and international law.

This is the case only as long as analysis can reasonably assume a mutual and reciprocal rationality on the part of Washington and Tehran. In the "real world," of course, this assumption could prove problematic at best.

What is the common principal or overriding objective here? Assuredly, it is to achieve “escalation dominance,” but without suffering any simultaneous or corollary consequences of a major war. In principle, at least, this plausible goal would also pertain to Israel. If this US regional ally should consider once again an active posture of preemption - here, recalling especially the country's June 7, 1981 defensive strike against Saddam Hussein's Osiraq nuclear reactor - this stance could represent a timely and present-day expression of the "<a style="cursor: help" title="See Menachem Begin Heritage Center, Israel's Strike Against the Iraqi Nuclear Reactor 7 June 1981, a collection of original articles and lectures by Yitzhak Shamir, Rafael Eitan, David Ivri, Yaakov Amidror, Yuval Ne'eman, Yoash Tsiddon-Chatto, and Louis René Beres. See also: Louis René Beres and COL. (IDF/ret.) Yoash Tsiddon-Chatto, 'Reconsidering Israel's Destruction of Iraq's Osiraq Nuclear Reactor,' 9 Temple International and Comparative Law Journal, 437 (1995). COL. Tsiddon-Chatto was a Chief of Planning for the Israel Air Force, and a member of Professor Louis René Beres' Project Daniel (2003).">Begin Doctrine</a>."

For the most part, they key issues here are doctrinal ones. Accordingly, there will be several interlinked <a style="cursor: help" title="'Everything is very simple in war,' says classic military strategist Carol von Clausewitz in On War, 'but even the simplest thing is difficult.'">factors</a> and subsidiary goals to consider by decision-makers in Washington and Tehran, but Mr. Trump might still seek some sort or other of recognizable "victory." As an “antecedent” consideration, however, the very idea of somehow achieving a traditional military triumph amid such utterly bewildering circumstances would be flawed. In essence, for the United States, a military victory could carry no current operational significance because it could no longer express any tangible or identifiable correlates.

Certain questions necessarily arise. Most meaningfully, what, if anything, could constitute a determinable American victory over Iran? Plainly, thus far, no one seems to have offered any reasonably specific or prospectively useful ideas. Additionally, the patently seductive notion that some measurable victory could be achieved via successive competitive risk-taking interactions with Iran ignores a thoroughly basic and incontestable postulate: Any successes achieved by “escalation dominance” must be transient and perilous.

Prima facie, though any US war with Iran would be technically “asymmetrical,” the Islamic Republic, even as it remains a conspicuous non-nuclear adversary, could represent a distressingly formidable foe.

Just how formidable could become most immediately apparent in Israel, rather than in the United States itself. This is because the largest fraction of any Iranian military strikes would likely be launched by Hezbollah rockets fired directly and perhaps exclusively at <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, terrorist movements are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.' See: Research in International Law: Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime, 29 AM J. INT'L L. (Supp 1935) 435, 566 (quoting King v. Marsh (1615), 3 Bulstr. 27, 81 Eng. Rep 23 (1615)('a pirate est Hostes humani generis')).">Israel</a>.

All things considered, President Trump ought never affirm that America’s goal vis-à-vis Iran is “to win," but instead acknowledge that any US search for military success in this theater will be operationally oriented and reliably fact-based; that is, it will be tempered by a consciously prudent presidential attention to escalatory caution. Here, determining what, exactly, might best identify a "sweet spot" in optimizing two fixedly interconnected strategic goals (escalation dominance and national security) will depend upon both the determinable extent of any still-ongoing crisis and on all available analytic bases for advancing systematic course comparisons.

By definition, if unable to compare all possible outcomes to a particular crisis, Mr. Trump and his counselors would then be unable to decide rationally between relevant alternatives. Even more important, all issues of rational decision would then have to be raised and appraised in every corresponding crisis. Will Iranian moves and counter-moves be expectedly consistent with rational decision-making obligations in a "Westphalian" or <a style="cursor: help" title="The de facto condition of Hobbesian anarchy within which the United States and Israel must make their pertinent assessments stands in evident contrast to the legal assumption of solidarity between states. This idealized assumption concerns a presumptively common struggle against both aggression and terrorism. Such a 'peremptory' expectation, known formally in law as a jus cogens assumption, was already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE); Hugo Grotius, 2 De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres, Ch. 20 (Francis W. Kesey., tr, Clarendon Press, 1925)(1690); and Emmerich de Vattel, 1 Le Droit Des Gens, Ch. 19 (1758).">anarchic</a> world politics?

It's not a simple question. Though difficult to answer, this question will need to be raised whenever Washington and Tehran find themselves caught up in any complex escalatory <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, Iran could rely heavily upon such surrogate sub-state forces as Hezbollah. Accordingly, any explicit application of the law of war to insurgents dates to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. As more than codified treaties and conventions must comprise the law of war, it is plain that the obligations of jus in bello (justice in war) are part of 'the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' and thereby bind all categories of belligerents. Further, Hague Convention IV of 1907 declares that even in the absence of a precisely published set of guidelines regarding 'unforeseen cases,' the operative pre-conventional sources of humanitarian international law obtain and still govern all belligerency. The related Martens Clause is included in the Preamble of the 1899 Hague Conventions, International Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War by Land, July 29, 1899, 187 Consol. T.S. 429, 430.">competition</a>. For Jerusalem, moreover, whatever transpires here could become a matter of more than a merely passing interest.

There is more. Typically, nation-states no longer expressly <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, traditionally, it was held that a formal declaration of war was necessary before a state of war would exist. Hugo Grotius divided wars into declared wars, which were legal, and undeclared wars, which were not. By the twentieth century, the Hague Convention III codified that war exists only after a conclusive declaration of war by one of the parties. This treaty stipulated that hostilities must never commence without a 'previous and explicit warning' in a declaration of war or an ultimatum. Currently, declarations of war may be tantamount to admissions of international criminality, because of the express criminalization of aggression by authoritative international law, and it could represent a clear jurisprudential absurdity to tie a state of war to formal and prior declarations of belligerency. A state of war may exist without formal declarations, but only if there is an actual armed conflict between two or more states, and/or at least one of these states considers itself 'at war.'">declare</a> wars or enter into legally binding war-terminating agreements. Conceptually, therefore, applying any classical or traditional criteria of "war winning" to still-impending military struggles with Iran could make no conceivable sense. To this American president’s "credit," however, he has yet to apply his more abstractly belligerent rhetoric concerning “victory” to Iran. To the contrary, following Iran's seemingly limited military reprisal on January 8, 2020 (a rocket attack against certain US positions in Iraq), Trump promptly tweeted his view that this reprisal could end the then current US-Iran cycle of strike and counterstrike.

In the "good old days," a time extending well into the twentieth-century, warring states first had to defeat an enemy army before being able to wreak any wished-for destruction upon that adversary’s cities and infrastructures. Then, in those earlier days of traditional diplomatic arrangements concerning war and peace, an individual state's military’s capacity to win was necessarily prior to achieving any capacity to destroy. Today, a state adversary needn't first defeat American armies to harm the US as a nation. Now, reciprocally, of course, America need not first be able to “win” a war with Iran in order to successfully threaten that country with purposeful strategies of deterrence and/or inflict upon it grave military harms.

For US President Donald Trump, the core lesson of all these evolving transformations should be the following awareness: operationally, winning and losing against Iran has become effectively extraneous and/or starkly injurious to America’s most rudimentary national security interests. In principle, any misconceived Trump orientation to "winning" within this daunting “dyad” of armed competition and conflict could lead the United States toward certain genuinely irreversible losses.

Derivatively, any such misdirected orientations could play havoc with US ally Israel's indispensable national security.

It follows from all this, <em>inter alia</em>, that U.S. military posture toward Iran should never be shaped according to the invariably barren expectations of clamorous presidential clichés or annoyingly empty witticisms. Rather, the American president’s focus should be fixed steadily upon only the most disciplined theses and antitheses of refined strategic thought. More exactly, this means a self-conscious US doctrinal commitment to <a style="cursor: help" title="The term 'dialectic' originates from the Greek expression for the art of conversation. A common contemporary meaning is method of seeking truth by correct reasoning. From the standpoint of shaping Israel's strategy vis-à-vis Iran, the following operations could be regarded as essential but nonexclusive components: (1) a method of refutation conducted by examining logical consequences; (2) a method of division or repeated logical analysis of genera into species; (3) logical reasoning using premises that are probable or generally accepted; (4) formal logic; and (5) the logical development of thought through thesis and antithesis to fruitful synthesis of these opposites.">dialectical</a> military thinking; that is, to a continuous process of asking and answering pertinent <a style="cursor: help" title="'Whenever the new Muses present themselves,' warned the great Spanish existentialist philosopher, José Ortega y Gasset, 'the masses bristle.' See Ortega y Gasset, The Dehumanization of Art (1925) (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1948, 1968), p.7.">questions</a>. Among other things, during any still-upcoming crisis with Iran, American military planners should consider what could happen if there would simultaneously open up a “second front.”

It is entirely plausible that Donald Trump would feel compelled to pursue escalation dominance with Tehran (not yet nuclear) and Pyongyang (already nuclear) at the same time. What then? From the standpoint of US ally Israel, the stakes could sometimes be existential. To wit, any crossing of the nuclear threshold on the Korean peninsula (whether by the US or North Korea) could have overwhelmingly significant implications for its own still-ambiguous nuclear strategy and for a catastrophic Middle Eastern <a style="cursor: help" title="See this writer's latest book, Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (2016; 2nd ed. 2018).">war</a>.

Long ago, Sun-Tzu reasoned famously: "Subjugating the enemy's army without fighting is the true pinnacle of excellence." To meet current U.S. national security objectives vis-à-vis Iran, this ancient Chinese military wisdom suggests, inter alia, that America’s strategic orientation emphasize <a style="cursor: help" title="Nonetheless, the US capacity to deter would vary in part according to the more-or-less fanatical belief system of a pertinent adversary. In this connection, the all-seeing observation of German historian Oswald Spengler is worth noting: Says Spengler: ''I believe,' is the great word against metaphysical fear, and at the same time it is an avowal of love.' See: The Decline of the West, his Chapter on 'Pythagoras, Mohammed, Cromwell.'">deterrence</a> (potentially the simultaneous dissuasion of multiple adversaries), not victory. Naturally, any such informed emphasis must also be intentionally connected to meeting the variously complex requirements of coinciding military escalations.

These more-or-less simultaneous escalations, whether expected or unexpected, could involve significant underestimations of enemy intent and/or military capacity. They could also involve certain unforeseen but important synergies. Again, these very specific interactive effects would represent the result of various separate decisional outcomes in which the “whole” or cumulative effect would be greater than the simple arithmetic sum of pertinent “parts.”

President Donald Trump ought to be made more fully aware of these "caveats." Escalation dominance is no less relevant today than it was in earlier military history. It still remains a critical decisional consideration, but one presenting in markedly different ways. Specifically, it is now absolutely central to ensuring stable deterrence against a broad variety of enemies, both state and sub-state, and in assorted circumstances that could favor conventional military ordnance (non-nuclear) to those armed forces that would be nuclear.

In the case of Iran, Trump should take into especially serious account the asymmetrical but operationally significant alignments that obtain between Tehran and non-state Shiite militia Hezbollah.

Already, the Hezbollah "general staff" can field very large “armies” and tens of thousands of conventional but overwhelmingly lethal rocket forces. In this connection, it is entirely conceivable that certain escalations between Washington and Tehran could sometime bring extraordinary harms to Israel. This is the case, moreover, whether or not the Jewish State would have any presumptive or perceived involvement in any related military operations.

During any potential spiral of deterrence and counter-deterrence, US President Trump's most basic obligation should never be to "win" against Tehran and/or its designated Hezbollah proxies, but to efficiently dominate complex escalatory processes without placing America's elemental security at an expanding peril. Should he mistakenly seek some "victory" at all costs against Iran, however, Trump would more likely cast all residually critical caution to the winds, and thus invite largely unpredictable levels of both American and Israeli losses.

In the matter of Iran, managing escalation dominance without spawning any corollary catastrophe will continuously represent a fundamental <a style="cursor: help" title="The ancient Greeks and Macedonians were fond of calling war a struggle of 'mind over mind,' rather than one of 'mind over matter.' To be sure, similar sentiments animated ancient Chinese military strategist, Sun-Tzu, and much later, Prussian military thinker, Carl von Clausewitz.">intellectual obligation</a> of the United States. Under no circumstances should such management be undertaken by President Donald Trump with a principal view to pleasing public political tastes. Always, for the United States and its relevant allies, especially Israel, managing competitive risk-taking dynamics with Iran must remain an overriding security objective.

But the relevant efforts should never stem from some narrowly opportunistic and/or self-defeating goal of "winning."

In the end, whether or not the Trump-ordered “<a style="cursor: help" title="This is not to disregard the very significant legal aspects of the 'termination.'">termination</a>” of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani proves to have been cost-effective for the United States (and derivatively, for Israel) will depend significantly on having first fully understood this core strategic obligation.

For both America and Israel, any plausible successes against Iran will eventually depend upon a commendably common awareness in Washington and Jerusalem that the ongoing struggle with Tehran must always be waged with suitably refined doctrines of military engagement. Accordingly, if US President Donald Trump continues to approach this expansively unpredictable regional conflict with a narrowly visceral or "seat-of-the-pants" ethos, both countries will experience not any reassuring semblances of "victory," but rather variously cascading elements of military and civilian loss. For Israel, still joined at the hip with the United States (at least as long as its existential nuclear strategy remains "deliberately ambiguous"), the manifestly evident shortcomings of this particular American president should be assessed continually, and with an amply conspicuous measure of <a style="cursor: help" title="The reference here is to the 'universal doubt' encouraged by René Descartes, Discourse on Method (1637).">Cartesian doubt</a>.

However unwittingly, an ally operating without any coherent strategic doctrine could become a de facto foe of the United States. It follows, both for Washington and Jerusalem, that identifying and implementing plausible goals vis-à-vis Iran must proceed according to a coherent and antecedent doctrine. Anything less refined would only leave both countries substantially ill-prepared and more conspicuously vulnerable.

In all continuing matters of US national security concern, the search for any decisive military victory over Iran would be fanciful, misdirected and fraught with unnecessary peril. Such a search would also carry very grave and significant legal risks.

		<title>June v. Gee: When the Issue Involves Pregnancy and Abortion Inconsistency Should Come as No Surprise</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/june-medical-services-llc-v-gee-3/">June Medical Services v. Gee</a>, the first abortion case since Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh became members of that court. The Court will rule on the constitutionality of a Louisiana law that is identical to a Texas law struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016. In <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt</a>, the Court held that a Texas law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital was unconstitutional because it imposed a substantial and undue burden on women seeking abortions. Three years later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ignored this precedent and reached the opposite conclusion, deciding that an identical admitting-privileges law in Louisiana did not impose a substantial or undue burden.

Contradictory? Yes. But these rulings are also in keeping with a Court that has never arrived upon a consistent view of the rights of the 51% of people who have the capacity for pregnancy - the precursor to abortion. Stories from two other Supreme Court cases illustrate this.

The first is from <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/">Roe v. Wade</a>. The named plaintiff, Jane Roe, was pregnant and living in Texas when she brought a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the Texas law that made it a crime to procure an abortion. Roe, however, was not alone. A couple, called Mary and John Doe, also wanted to challenge the law.

Like Jane Roe, this couple wanted to see Texas’ abortion law declared unconstitutional. According to their complaint, Mrs. Doe was suffering from a neural-chemical disorder and her physician had advised her to avoid pregnancy until her condition had materially improved. Pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of birth control pills (that were at the time manufactured with dangerously high levels of estrogen). If she did become pregnant, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a “competent, licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions.”

The Supreme Court denied the Does the right to sue in the federal court system. According to the Court, this married couple did not have standing because they had no actual injury. Rather, they had “only an alleged ‘detrimental effect upon [their] marital happiness’ because they are forced to ‘the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy.’” As the Court explained, “Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of health. Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take place and all may not combine.”

In other words, the Does’ injuries were speculative, not real or actual.

Eight years later, however, the Supreme Court saw the possibility of pregnancy in quite different terms when it considered the constitutionality of a California statutory rape law that penalized underage sexual intercourse for males but not females.

In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/464/#tab-opinion-1953983">Michael M. v. Sonoma County</a>, a 17-year-old boy, Michael M. and, had sexual intercourse with a 16-year-old girl. The boy alone was charged with statutory rape. Michael M. challenged the law’s constitutionality as a violation of his right to equal protection.

In a complete about-face from the rationale used to deny the Does their day in federal court, the Court in <em>Michael M.</em> held that the possibility of pregnancy was a profoundly influential, ever-present factor in a woman’s life; in other words not “speculative.” Although the 16-year-old girl that Michael had sex with did not get pregnant, the Court saw pregnancy and its potential consequences including abortions, the medical risks associated with pregnancy, and the social consequences of childbearing as so concrete that the Court concluded that the mere possibility of pregnancy provided a substantial deterrent to girls under 18 from engaging in sexual intercourse. And since, according to the court, no similar “natural sanctions” deter males from having sex, the Court upheld the male-only criminal sanction because it served to roughly “equalize” the deterrents on both sexes. Specifically, in Michael M., the Court concluded that the risk of pregnancy and its consequences are so definite and substantial that they are equivalent to the threat of arrest, conviction and a prison term of 4 years.

Considering <em>Michael M.</em> and the Court’s ruling on standing in <em>Roe</em>, we should not be surprised by the Court’s inconsistency in deciding whether laws limiting access to abortion create undue burdens or no burden at all. We should remember that <em>June Medical Services v. Gee</em> will be decided not only by a court with two new members committed to overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, but also by an institution that hasn’t made up its mind whether the capacity for pregnancy is an ever present threat to women’s freedom (like a term of incarceration) or is a dismissible and inconsequential possibility with little or no impact on a woman’s life (or, for that matter, her partner’s).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">For more than 20 years, a key prosecution witness in Maryland criminal proceedings named Joseph Kopera, a firearms expert for the state crime lab, routinely and blatantly lied about his resume, background, qualifications, and other matters. Recently, the Maryland State Police <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/firearms-expert-forged-signatures-on-lab-reports-maryland-state-police-say/2019/12/28/67b49116-1c34-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html">discovered</a> that he also forged signatures on firearms ballistics reports. His testimony was used to wrongfully convict hundreds, if not thousands, of defendants across the state. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Kopera was not the first and no doubt will not be the last prosecution witness to perjure himself. In 2017, a Massachusetts crime lab technician named Annie Dookhan <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/10/20/another-week-another-crime-lab-scandal/?utm_term=.c4e2c92bf68f">plead guilty</a> to contaminating drug samples, tampering with evidence, and obstructing justice in thousands of cases.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> In 2015, prosecutors in Washington, D.C., <a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/bso-crime-lab-could-be-mishandling-crucial-dna-evidence-whistleblower-says-7881208">stopped sending</a> DNA samples to the city crime lab because of concerns about that lab misstating the likelihood that DNA had been left at a crime scene.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When criminal convictions are predicated on perjured testimony that the prosecution had knowledge of, either actually or constructively, then what should become of the conviction? The Maryland Court of Appeals faced this issue in the case of </span><a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2016/78a15.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie v. State, </span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">449 Md. 494 (2016). In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the defendant had been convicted based in part upon the perjured testimony of Mr. Kopera.  Mr. Kopera had been the State’s go-to witness for at least ten years, testifying 125 – 130 times per year. He would venture opinions favorable to the state on any number of issues, not just ballistics. In almost every case, however, he openly lied about his credentials. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Perjury is nothing new in the criminal justice system, and courts have developed rules for dealing with it. In the leading case of </span><a href="http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep360/usrep360264/usrep360264.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Napue v. Illinois</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 360 U.S. 264, 272 (1959), the Supreme Court reversed a conviction because “the false testimony used by the State in securing the conviction of petitioner </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">may have had an effect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the outcome of the trial.” In that case, a witness testified falsely that he had received no consideration in return for his testimony, when in fact he had received consideration and the prosecutor did nothing to correct the witness’ false testimony. The Court found this to be a violation of due process. The false testimony went only to the issue of the witness’ credibility, but the Supreme Court ruled that “a lie is a lie” and reversed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Maryland courts have held that perjured evidence is material if there is a “substantial possibility” that if the evidence had been revealed the result of the trial would have been “different.” </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/state-v-thomas-809"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">State v. Thomas</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 325 Md. 160, 190 (1992). Whether there is a difference between these two standards is unclear. A result can be “different” if the result of a trial would have been a hung jury instead of a judgment of guilt, or if certain counts (but not all) might have been acquitted. Maryland’s actual innocence statute,<a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/md/criminal-procedure/md-code-crim-proc-sect-8-301.html"> Section 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article</a>, provides relief where there is a “substantial or significant possibility” that the result may have been different. The choice of words is interesting. Was the use of “possibility” instead of “probability” important? Is there a difference between a “substantial possibility” and a “significant possibility”? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The courts, both federal and state, have applied a different standard where the evidence in question was perjured testimony (as opposed to non-disclosed facts or tangible evidence) that the prosecution knew or should have known about. In those cases, “a new trial is required if the false testimony could </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in any reasonable likelihood </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">have affected the judgment of the jury.” </span><a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/data/opinions/coa/2010/119a09.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yearby v. State</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, 414 Md. 708 n.5 (2010)(quoting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Napue v. Illinois</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, 360 U.S. 264, 271 (1959)). In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yearby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the court acknowledged that “[t]his standard is stricter against the State.”  It doesn’t call for the reviewing court to speculate about what the outcome should have been (“different result”), but rather whether the evidence in “any reasonable likelihood” had “affected the judgment of the jury.” Notably, the word “any” is used to modify the “reasonable likelihood” to emphasize the heightened standard of review to be applied. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Maryland Court of Appeals’ decision in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie v. State</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a significant misapplication of this standard. It is unclear whether he would have been accepted as an expert without these embellishments. However, with the truth of his character exposed, his acceptance as an expert was impossible, and the results of the vast majority of cases would not have been the same. Common sense dictates that jurors, upon learning that the State had presented perjured testimony to them, as well as in other cases, would have reacted negatively.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Did the Court of Appeals apply the law correctly in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">? The Court applied a watered-down test to the evidence using the standard of a “substantial possibility” of a different result. The Supreme Court in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Napue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, however, held that the proper test is whether knowledge of the perjury “in any reasonable likelihood” would have affected the judgment of the jury. Maryland’s Court of Appeals acknowledged that this is a stricter test against the prosecution in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yearby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.   It did not apply it, however, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.  Mr. McGhie had a right to have the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Napue/Yearby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> standard applied as a matter of due process. Defendants convicted on the basis of perjured testimony have a right to have their cases reviewed under the stricter test, but that isn’t happening in cases now due to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">McGhie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> opinion. It isn’t clear how inmates would invoke this right, since under the statute for newly discovered evidence the legislature utilized language tracking the more relaxed standard. Mr. Kopera’s deceit was more than newly discovered evidence, however: it was perjury and a violation of the constitutional promise of due process of law.  A standard that may be appropriate for newly discovered DNA evidence may not be appropriate when the State has employed perjured testimony by a State employee to secure a conviction. That is the lesson of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Napue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yearby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">,  but it doesn’t seem the lesson has been learned in Maryland.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The power of impeachment is a central feature of our democracy. The founders of our country and the framers of our Constitution gave the matter careful consideration. They would not have created the office of the Presidency nor would they have given the President sweeping powers without this necessary check and balance on the exercise of those powers.

The American people elect the President, but elections are no protection against a President who seeks to undermine the electoral process. Only impeachment can prevent a President from securing election or re-election through corrupt means.

Every American, including the President, is subject to the law, and moreover the President is bound to faithfully execute the law. But when the President refuses to execute the law–and when the Justice Department contends that a sitting President is not subject to indictment–there is no remedy for a corrupt or lawless President but impeachment.

The President is Commander-in-Chief, nominates ambassadors, and is the sole voice of this country in foreign affairs. But these powers are not unbounded. Only Congress may declare war. Only Congress can confirm the appointment of military officers and ambassadors. Only Congress can ratify treaties or enact legislation regulating foreign commerce. The President has the sole power to speak on behalf of the United States, but if the President betrays this country to foreign powers then the President can and should be impeached.

The core principle of American government is that all just powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed. This principle took centuries to take root, and grow, and blossom in England and then in America. Centuries ago, the King was sovereign; still, Parliament arose to challenge those absolute powers, and in 1376 the “Good Parliament” chose to impeach Richard Lyons (Lord Latimer), the utterly corrupt Keeper of the Mint. Ten years later the “Wonderful Parliament” impeached Michael de la Pole (the Earl of Suffolk), the Chancellor, for embezzlement and negligence. Parliament coined the phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” to describe the Chancellor’s offenses, and thereafter used the term to impeach and remove “high” public officials who abused their powers. In 1765 Blackstone defined “high misdemeanors” as “the maladministration of such high officers, as are in the public trust or employment.” In 1786, Parliament impeached Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India, for corruption. Edmund Burke, who championed women’s rights and the rights of the people of America and the rights of the people of India, led the prosecution of Hastings in Parliament and authored “The Articles of Impeachment for High Crimes and Misdemeanors Against Warren Hastings” accusing Hastings of corrupt dealings and fomenting violence in India–not crimes, but grave abuses of power.

After the establishment of English colonies in America, it did not take long for the American colonists to similarly assert the right to impeach public officials who abused their powers. In 1685 the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly voted to impeach the Pennsylvania Chief Justice Nicholas More for “high crimes and misdemeanors.” He was accused of corruption, bullying juries and failing to hold court. Royal and proprietary officials were also impeached by colonial assemblies in Rhode Island, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina. The most famous impeachment was that of Chief Justice Peter Oliver in Massachusetts in 1774, the year before the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Oliver was impeached not for committing a crime, but for accepting a salary from the crown instead of the colonial legislature. A leading Loyalist, his loyalty to the American people was suspect.

In 1776, after the Declaration of Independence was issued, the American people adopted state constitutions, and nearly every one of them provided for impeachment. In Pennsylvania, for example, the House of Representatives was authorized to impeach public officers who were then tried by the President and Council of Pennsylvania. In 1787 when the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia the President of Pennsylvania–the person who had the authority to preside over trials of impeachment in that state–was Benjamin Franklin, who became a leading advocate for granting Congress the power to impeach the President of the United States.

After winning the Revolution the American government was formed by the States–the Articles of Confederation, which created a “perpetual league of friendship” among the States. But our country was weak and divided, and we desired “a more perfect union,” and the Framers designed a new government that would be created not by the States but by “We the People,” and the principle of popular sovereignty–the notion that sovereignty resides in the people, not in the government–took another step forward.

The Framers acknowledged that this new government needed a “chief magistrate”–a single voice to enforce the law and represent our country with foreign nations. But they were firm that this leader would not be a King. Unlike a King the President would be elected. And unlike a King the President could be impeached. At every point where the Framers discussed the office of the Presidency–whether the Presidency should be created at all; whether the office should be held by a single individual or by a committee; what powers the office should exercise–any doubts or opposition were overcome by the promise that President, unlike a King, could be impeached. Upon this the Framers were resolute. Here are but a few of their observations on this point:

James Wilson: “Far from being above the laws, he [the President] is amenable to them by impeachment.”

James Madison, in response to the argument that a President might abuse his power by pardoning co-conspirators: “If the President by connected, in any suspicious manner, with any person, and there be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the House of Representatives can impeach him.”

James Wilson, on the same point: “If he be himself a party to the guilt he can be impeached and prosecuted.”

Edmund Randolph: “There is another provision against the danger … of the President receiving emoluments from foreign powers. If discovered, he may be impeached.”

William Davie: “If he be not impeachable whilst in office, he will spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself re-elected. I consider this as a security for the good behavior of our Executive.”

George Mason: “No point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued. Shall any man be above Justice?”

Benjamin Franklin: “What was the practice before this in cases where the chief Magistrate rendered himself obnoxious? Why recourse was had to assassination in which he was not only deprived of his life but of the opportunity of vindicating his character. It would be the best way therefore to provide in the Constitution for the regular punishment of the Executive where his misconduct should deserve it, and for his honorable acquittal when he should be unjustly accused.”

James Madison: “I think it indispensable that some provision should be made for defending the community against the incapacity, negligence, or perfidy of the chief Magistrate. The limitation of the period of his service is not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a scheme of peculation or oppression. He might betray his trust to foreign powers.”

Elbridge Gerry: “I urge the necessity of impeachments. A good magistrate will not fear them. A bad one ought to be kept in fear of them. I hope the maxim would never be adopted here that the chief magistrate could do no wrong.”

Gouverneur Morris, who had initially opposed the power of impeachment: “My opinion has been changed by the arguments used in the discussion. I am now sensible of the necessity of impeachments, if the Executive is to continue for any time in office. Our Executive is not like a Magistrate having a life interest, much less like one having an hereditary interest in his office. He may be bribed by a greater interest to betray his trust; and no one would say that we ought to expose ourselves to the danger of seeing the first Magistrate in foreign pay, without being able to guard against it by displacing him. … This Magistrate is not the King but the prime-Minister. The people are the King.”

Indeed. The people are the King.

		<title>Destroy Everything Segregated – The Life Work of Fred D. Gray, Sr.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Martin Luther King Jr. called Fred Gray the chief counsel of the Civil Rights movement. Gray was born in Alabama in 1930. Born and raised in the segregated South, he understood the full impact of segregation on black communities and experienced it personally. Gray attended a Christian boarding school in Nashville, Tennessee, because, at the time, there were no high schools for black students in his own community in Alabama until after World War II. He earned an undergraduate degree from Alabama State College, a segregated college, before leaving Alabama again to pursue a law degree at Case Western Reserve University. Gray made a promise to himself that he would fight to destroy everything segregated he could find.

In 1954, Fred Gray earned his law degree, was admitted to the Ohio and Alabama bars, and opened his own law office in Montgomery, Alabama. His work to destroy segregation began the next year when he represented Claudette Colvin and Rosa Parks. Both women were charged with disorderly conduct for refusing to move to the segregated section of the bus. Their convictions led to the Montgomery bus boycott, a seminal event in the Civil Rights movement.

He continued on, successfully representing Vivian Malone and James Hood; students unlawfully denied admission to the University of Alabama. After the District Judge ordered they be admitted, Alabama Governor George Wallace <a href="https://www.npr.org/2003/06/11/1294680/wallace-in-the-schoolhouse-door">famously blocked</a> the doorway to prevent their pre-registration at the University. Gray would represent clients in the desegregation of all the public colleges and universities in Alabama as well as over 100 local schools.

Gray kept his promise to himself, fighting all forms of segregation. He was involved with a gerrymandering case, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960/32"><em>Gomillion v. Lightfoot</em></a>, in which the district lines had been redrawn to excluded nearly every African American voter. When the case reached the Supreme Court, Gray presented the arguments. He carried a map of the new district of Tuskegee, which had gone from a square to a 28-sided figure. When Justice Frankfurter asked why the Tuskegee Institute was not on the map, Gray knew he had won.

As chief counsel of the Civil Rights movement, Gray’s impact went beyond the Civil Rights movement. Through his representation of the Martin Luther King Jr. in a tax perjury case, Gray would come to secure the first amendment press freedoms of all Americans. <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1963/39"><em>Times v. Sullivan</em></a> set the standard for libel law. Gray represented the ministers who were accused of making defamatory statements about police brutality in Alabama in an advertisement in the New York Times. The ad was designed to raise money for Martin Luther King Jr.’s defense on the tax perjury case.

Gray’s Civil Rights work also created a ripple effect in the protection of human research subjects. He represented the plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit about the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">Tuskegee Syphilis Study</a>. The U.S. Public Health Service enrolled poor African American men, telling them they would get free health care and funeral benefits, in exchange for participating in a study about syphilis. In reality, the study was the observation of the natural progression of untreated syphilis. Gray negotiated a $10 million-dollar settlement for the 72 subjects still alive in 1975. The subsequently infected spouses and congenitally infected children were eventually compensated as well. The lawsuit led to the several federal laws designed to protect human research subjects.

In his memoir, Bus Ride to Justice, Gray urges young lawyers to “finish the unfinished tasks of destroying discrimination and segregation wherever found.” While the problems of discrimination are massive and complex, they cannot be ignored. He highlights the issues of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-race-discrimination-and-creditors-rights/">economic discrimination</a> and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/01/florida-supreme-court-rules-felons-must-pay-all-fines-before-voting-rights-can-be-restored/">voter disenfranchisement</a>. He ends the memoir with a grim observation, “no objective observer can claim that Alabama or any other Southern state has completely removed discrimination and the legacies of slavery and segregation from its electoral systems or institutional structures. To pretend otherwise is disingenuous at best.”

		<title>States Should Not Adopt a Speech Code for Lawyers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>Attorneys litigate on both sides of some of the most contentious issues in the country: affirmative action, rent control, abortion rights, gun rights, you name it. Sometimes the positions attorneys take may </span><span>be seen as</span><span> offensive, as those positions may run contrary to more “popular” opinions. But in our adversarial system of justice, free speech is necessary on these and other thorny subjects. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>Unfortunately, a proposed rule of professional conduct under consideration by policymakers in several states across the country would stifle controversial speech by attorneys. Should this rule be adopted, attorneys who speak out on controversial matters or represent unpopular clients will risk discipline and may even lose their ability to practice law – a disastrous outcome for the spirit of free speech and open inquiry. States should reject this dangerous rule without delay. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>The proposed rule is based on the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_8_4_misconduct/">American Bar Association’s Model Rule 8.4(g)</a>. Parts of the proposed rule are uncontroversial and welcome. For instance, the rule prohibits sexual harassment and other forms of harassment against co-workers or subordinates. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>Unfortunately, the rule goes far beyond preventing harassment. It prohibits any “verbal … conduct that manifests bias or prejudice towards others” based on race, sex, religion, sexual orientation or socioeconomic status. The vagueness of this language invites arbitrary and subjective enforcement – which invariably creates a conflict with our tradition of freedom of speech. By regulating speech that falls well short of harassment, attorneys will have to think twice about taking public stances on controversial issues for fear that their speech will be considered offensive. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>For instance, imagine if two attorneys are asked to debate whether the state should adopt rent control. The speaker arguing in favor of rent control argues that absentee landlords are profiteering off the poor and that rent control is needed to mitigate their greed. The speaker arguing against rent control extols the virtues of private property ownership and entrepreneurship and argues that renters need to work harder in order to meet the rising cost of rent rather than demand subsidies from landlords. If a listener is offended, the state bar could conceivably discipline either of these attorneys for manifesting “bias” </span><span>on the basis of</span><span> socioeconomic status. </span><span>So</span><span> the model rule would chill the willingness of any attorney to speak publicly of matters of great consequence. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>The model rule also blatantly discriminates in favor of certain viewpoints. The rule exempts “conduct undertaken to promote diversity and inclusion.” In other words, an attorney may safely argue affirmative action programs are necessary to combat the evils of white supremacy. But an attorney might be in jeopardy if they were to argue we should reject affirmative action in order to strive for a colorblind society. If the latter attorney were to quote, say, Justice Antonin Scalia’s declaration that “In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American,” they could face professional sanctions. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>As if all of that weren’t bad enough, this misguided rule reaches beyond the public realm into the private. The rule is not limited to when a lawyer operates a law firm or appears in court. Instead, it applies even to social activities such as bar association events. </span><span>So</span><span> an attorney discussing a controversial topic with a friend at dinner could be in jeopardy of discipline if someone were to overhear the conversation and take offense. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>When the ABA proposes a model rule, it is usually embraced and quickly adopted by states across the country. Thankfully, Model Rule 8.4(g) has thus far been soundly rejected in most states where it came under consideration. Only one state, Vermont, has chosen to adopt the rule in full, and Maine has adopted a version of the rule that stripped out some of the more egregious elements. At least 11 states have flatly rejected it. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>Attorneys General in several states have spoken out, calling the law an unconstitutional speech code. Alaska’s Attorney General </span><a href="http://www.law.state.ak.us/pdf/press/190809-Letter.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.law.state.ak.us/pdf/press/190809-Letter.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1582939242167000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQWibF4wi1_eAeneRENwxroyMH6Q"><span>concluded</span></a><span> that the rule would “function as a civility code covering every aspect of a lawyer’s conduct, however peripheral to the administration of justice.” The Attorney General of Texas was even more blunt, </span><a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2016/kp0123.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/opinion-files/opinion/2016/kp0123.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1582939242167000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoVEltysVgLqz_nBMt7jyDgBFfug"><span>declaring</span></a><span> that Model Rule “8.4(g), if adopted in Texas, would unconstitutionally restrict freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, and freedom of association for members of the State Bar.”</span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>The Supreme Court recently reemphasized that regulations that burden professional speech, such as attorney speech, are presumptively unconstitutional. Such laws “pose the inherent risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or information.” That is exactly what Model Rule 8.4(g) would threaten to do if it were adopted and why it would almost certainly be invalidated after a lengthy and unnecessary legal battle. </span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400"><span>Fortunately, states across the country have been rejecting the model rule in order to avoid unnecessary threats to free speech and years of litigation. The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania still has the chance to do likewise. They should do </span><span>so, and</span><span> send a clear message that the right to free speech remains inviolable – for attorneys as well as all Americans. </span><span> </span></p>

		<title>Interpreting the Afghanistan Peace Agreement: Peace or no Peace?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 29th, the United States officials and Taliban representatives signed an <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/02/US-Taliban_Agreement.pdf">agreement</a> aiming to bring an end to the 19 years of conflict in Afghanistan. The United States and its allies invaded Afghanistan weeks after the September 2001 attack in New York by al-Qaeda. The Taliban were ousted from power but they became United States worst nightmare, hindering United States efforts in Afghanistan. The current political solution has the potential to pave the way for peace in Afghanistan. However, peace in Afghanistan depends on the type of political agreement between the Taliban and the United States. Unfortunately, the current agreement may not deliver a fully peaceful Afghanistan. As will be seen, the current agreement only seeks a peaceful transition for the United States not the Afghans.

The agreement is called “<em>Agreement for bringing peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and the United States of America</em>”. The framework for interpreting such an international agreement is provided in articles 31 and 32 of the <a href="https://www.trans-lex.org/500600/_/vienna-convention-on-the-law-of-treaties-of-1969/">1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> which allows for a good-faith interpretation in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the treaty in the light of its object and purpose.

The agreement is divided into four parts. Before delving deep into the details of the agreement, one particular aspect of the entire agreements needs urgent attention. The phrase ‘the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban’ is repeated through the agreement. The ordinary meaning of the phrase, if read with the rest of the agreement, suggests that the United States considers the Taliban as the de jure rulers of Afghanistan. A literal interpretation of the stated phrase would mean that from the United States point of view the current government of Afghanistan is no longer legitimate. This interpretation is supported by the rest of the agreement which acknowledges the Taliban's ability to grant visa’s and passports(<em>see part 2(5) of the Agreement</em>). The Taliban’s recognition as legitimate rulers under the agreements results into multiple complications. Since 2001 the agreements reached between Afghan governments and the United States may not be binding on the Taliban unless they succeed to them. Furthermore, the recognition of the Taliban as legitimate rulers raises the alarm of internal gridlock between the current Afghan Government and the Taliban. Afghanistan’s current President has already made a statement that it will not release the 5,000 Taliban prisoners that the United States agreed with the Taliban.

According to part one of the agreement, the United States is ‘committed to withdrawing from Afghanistan all military forces of the United States, and Coalition partners’. In the coming 135 days, the United States and its allies will reduce the number of U.S forces in Afghanistan to 8,600. It will withdraw the remaining forces within the remaining 9.5 months (<em>see part 1 (A) &amp; (B) of the Agreement</em>). Furthermore, the United States will work to release combat and political prisoners ‘as a confidence-building measure’. The agreement notes the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 prisoners of the other sides (<em>see part 1 (c) of the Agreement</em>). Under the agreement, the United States also commits to review the current US sanctions and aims to remove them by 27 August 2020 (<em>see part one (D) of the Agreement</em>); the United States will aim to remove the UN sanctions by 29 May 2020 (<em>See part 1 (E) of the Agreement</em>). <strong>Furthermore, the United States and its allies pledged to refrain from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan or intervening in its domestic affairs’</strong>(<em>part 1(F) of the Agreement</em>).

In return for the above-mentioned efforts, the agreements in part two put obligations on the Taliban. Part two of the agreement obliges the Taliban to take steps to prevent ‘any group or individual, including al-Qaida from, using the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its Allies. It further obliges Taliban to not issue ‘visas, passports, travel permits, or other legal documents’ to those who pose threat to the security of the United States and its allies to enter Afghanistan (<em>see part 2(5) of the Agreement</em>).

The agreement only protects the United States and its allies interest and in return, it accepts the Taliban as the legitimate State of Afghanistan; thus undermines the legitimacy of the current Afghan Government. It also undermines the 19 years democratization efforts of Afghanistan. The agreement does not put any obligations on the Taliban to make a peaceful settlement with the current Afghan Government. It also fails to bind the Taliban to uphold the rule of law and respect fundamental human right recognized by the UN. What does the future holds for education, women and civil liberties in Afghanistan are not observed in the agreement?

By giving the Taliban free hand, the United States has failed to respect the sacrifice of thousands of Afghans and its forces who stood against the brutalities of the Taliban. With the USA and its allies leaving Afghanistan, Afghans will be left at the mercy of the Taliban. Analysis of Whether there will be further escalations between the Taliban and the current Afghan government is outside the scope of this article. But two things are clear from the current agreement. Firstly, the agreement does not seek peace between the Afghans and the Taliban. Secondly, the US and its allies will not be able to interfere or rescue any side.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the most militarily powerful nation in the world, the US has largely been able to evade international justice, even when engaging in conduct for which other nations have been held accountable. To date, the vast majority of international criminal courts and tribunals have instead prosecuted defendants from developing states who lack the resources or authority to resist international criminal law.

Yet, the International Criminal Court (ICC) may recently have changed the inegalitarian landscape of international criminal law. In a <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1516">decision</a> rendered on March 5, 2020, the ICC Appeals Chambers <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/03/icc-allows-investigation-of-afghanistan-war-crimes/">authorized an investigation</a> into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan since May 2003. The decision also authorized an investigation into related crimes committed in the territory of other ICC States Parties that are “sufficiently linked” to the conflict in Afghanistan. The Appeals Chamber expressly decided that the scope of the investigation includes crimes committed by US military and CIA personnel against detainees held in facilities both in Afghanistan and in black sites in other nations. Such an investigation could potentially implicate current high-ranking US government officials.

This decision follows a protracted and contentious battle between the US and the ICC. In 2018, upon learning of the ICC’s intent to consider an investigation into Afghanistan, the Trump administration fired back with public denouncements of the court’s legitimacy and a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/04/us-revokes-visa-of-icc-prosecutor-over-afghanistan-investigation/">revocation</a> of US travel visas for court officials, including the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda. Shortly thereafter, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1448">rejected</a> Prosecutor Bensouda’s request to open the investigation, which many labeled a highly politicized move that reflected the ICC’s willingness to bend to US political pressures. The White House, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-8/">recognized</a> the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision as a “victory … for the rule of law.”

The Appeals Chamber’s March decision reversing and amending the Pre-Trial Chamber’s order, while of extreme significance, has two very different sets of consequences. On one hand, this is the first time the Court has opened an official investigation into a permanent member of the UN Security Council, evidencing a potential shift away from exclusively investigating crimes committed in and by nationals of developing states, thereby broadening the effective scope of international criminal law. On the other hand, this decision reignites the ICC’s conflict with the US, the effects of which may be devastating to the Court.

First, the decision marks an enormous milestone in the ICC’s development of a more equal approach to international justice. The decision comes following a multi-year legitimacy crisis afflicting the Court, in which the ICC has been widely criticized for its hyper-focus on prosecuting defendants from African states while permitting western powers to escape prosecution entirely. The Appeals Chamber’s decision directly refutes criticisms that the ICC bends to political pressures, and instead takes a stand against the bullying conduct directed at the Court by the US government. This decision sends a clear message that no matter how powerful a state’s government or military may be if that state’s leaders permit their nationals to engage in conduct that amounts to war crimes or crimes against humanity, they will be held responsible.

Yet, on the other hand, these achievements come with potentially ominous consequences. The US government has made clear that it will not permit the investigation to proceed without a fight. In a <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-pompeos-remarks-to-the-press/">press conference</a> held shortly after the announcement of the ICC decision, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled the decision a “political vendetta” rendered “by an unaccountable legal institution.” He further promised that the US would “take all appropriate actions to ensure that American citizens are not hauled” before the ICC. Pompeo’s statement is far from an empty threat. In 2002, under President Bush, Congress enacted The American Service-Members’ Protection Act, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/7427">22 U.S.C.A. § 7427</a>, colloquially dubbed “The Hague Invasion Act,” which legally forbids governmental cooperation with the ICC and authorizes the US president to use “all means necessary and appropriate” to bring about the release of any American detained by the Court.

Even absent the use of force against the ICC, the US has the resources and will to undermine the Court’s investigation into alleged American crimes. Not only has it proven that it can prevent ICC personnel from entering the country, but the US government will almost certainly decline to turn over documentary evidence and refuse ICC access to witness. As has been proven time and again, as with crimes committed in Cambodia, Syria, and Sudan, international criminal law holds a slim chance of providing justice without state support. When a state refuses to turn over its nationals for prosecution or repeatedly seeks to block prosecutorial investigations into alleged crimes, cases are routinely rendered infeasible. Moreover, there is also the chance that the US could pressure its allies-some of which, like Canada and the United Kingdom, are States Parties to the Rome Statute-to withdraw from the Court.

As of now, the full consequences of the ICC Appeal Chamber’s decision to open an investigation into Afghanistan have yet to be seen. The decision may lead the US to undermine the Court’s legitimacy and deprive it of the opportunity to conduct successful prosecutions. Yet, for the time being, the decision marks a clear win for a court that has been very much in need of one.

		<title>An Open Letter to the Legal Community on COVID-19: What are we doing?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been following the course of COVID-19, more colloquially known as Coronavirus, for a few months now and I really do not understand the wide mix of responses from the American legal community. Is our response due to a lack of leadership at the top? Or the wrong leadership perhaps? Is our response due to the disjointed nature of our profession (different bars and bar associations, different practice areas and jurisdictions)? Is our response something inherent to the individualistic mentality of our profession? I don’t know, but I feel the need to ask: What are we doing? Why are we doing it this way? And at the end of it all, who do we want to be?

To answer this question I want to talk about a series of different responses taken in reaction to the spread of COVID-19 in the US. It should be noted that most of these responses have only occurred within the last couple of weeks or so.
<h4>The ABA's Guidance for Law Schools</h4>
In February, the ABA issued a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/legal_education_and_admissions_to_the_bar/20-feb-guidance-on-disasters-and-emergencies.pdf">guidance memo</a> to law schools about how to handle the impact of COVID-19 on the current semester. The memo effectively discouraged any changes to the curriculum. It said that law schools can alter their curriculum under <a href="https://taskforces.osbar.org/files/2018/04/Alt-Path-ABA-standards.pdf">ABA Standards</a> pursuant to a variance under Standard 107(a)(1), but argued that such variances should be used only in the direst of circumstances because the value of the degree is too important. The ABA went on to discourage online classes because professors may not be properly trained or equipped to conduct them. The ABA’s ultimate suggestion seemed to be: Don’t Change Anything, but if you must change, then your best avenue is to extend the semester to account for the break or reduce the number of credits necessary for graduation to the ABA’s existing minimum of 83 credit hours.

Take a second to ponder that. The ABA could have issued any number of responses to the spread of COVID-19. They could have stressed the importance of people over requirements. They could have created a moratorium or exemption on requirements. They could have offered to assist law schools in exploring new technologies and teaching approaches possibly even subsidizing training or technology purchases. The ABA didn’t even bother to recommend canceling nonessential events. In the end, what it chose to do is say the degree matters more than the person. The “integrity” of the profession matters more than the risks to students or the very professors teaching them.
<h4>Mock Trials and Moot Courts</h4>
Mock trial and moot court competitions have been all over the map in response to COVID-19 (literally and figuratively). Moot courts have tended to cancel their events. The International Moot Court Competition in Rome was canceled on March 2. The William C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot Court Competition in Vienna was canceled on March 7. The Cardozo Moot Court Competition was also canceled this week.

Mock trial competitions, in contrast, have remained conspicuously silent on the issue. Few have said anything. The only one I could find in my brief research is the American Association for Justice, which hosts the Student Trial Advocacy Competition, a major competition involving as many as 224 four-student teams from 14 regions. It shared this <a href="https://www.justice.org/news/aaj-update-covid-19">post</a>, originally from February 24 but now dated March 5 though no updates have been made to it, explaining that the situation was being monitored. It should also be noted that this is a general post referring to all AAJ events; it doesn't appear anywhere on the organization’s page for the Student Trial Advocacy Competition. The event has now been canceled, but the AAJ admits that this is because nine law schools have withdrawn and two courthouses have refused to host. To date, it has not informed the individual students of cancellation, only the coaches.

This is understandably a difficult environment to make decisions in and it's complicated further by government directives and competing interests, but it feels somewhat callous to hold competitions in cities that are trying desperately to avoid further outbreaks. It also feels callous to ask students to risk travel and it may even be encouraging the wrong values in students by telling them that pride and accolades are worth more than their health and well-being and those of the community.
<h4>The Bright Side: Legal professionals, individual courts, and individual schools</h4>
Some groups are choosing to put people first, namely law students and professors, individual court systems, and law schools.

Let’s start with law students and professors. There is thriving discourse happening online about what law schools and legal professionals should do. This is a <a href="https://twitter.com/CanPanicNow/status/1234597348828991488?s=20">thread</a> by Kayla Molina, a current 2L Student in Oklahoma and a member of the ABA Law Student Division’s Editorial Board, wherein there is significant discussion about the ABA’s stringent requirements, particularly around attendance. It also includes a discussion of the ableist nature of such policies in general. Here is another <a href="https://twitter.com/jess_miers/status/1236383419950645248?s=20">thread</a> by Jess Miers, a 2L student at Santa Clara Law and a section 230 expert, in which she talks about struggling with the mental health effects of Coronavirus spread and reporting. Law professors are sharing existing content on online teaching as seen in Sam Brunson’s tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/smbrnsn/status/1237436897800134659?s=20">here</a> about Brian L. Frye’s Ipse Dixit podcast episode on the subject. David Hoffman, a professor at Penn Law, <a href="https://twitter.com/HoffProf/status/1237188388803031040?s=20">here</a> is analyzing how contracts might resolve the mass cancellations occurring because of the virus in a way that is sure to drive scholarship and legal reform in the near future. Discussion drives change and discussion is happening online across multiple states and universities and members of the profession. Some groups are choosing to put people first, namely law students and professors, individual court systems, and law schools.

Court systems are taking a variety of different measures. Courts in Seattle are postponing in-person appearances in some cases while Seattle and Tacoma federal courts have put all jury trials <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article240974361.html">on hold</a> to combat the outbreak. Courts in New York are <a href="https://www.law.com/2020/03/10/as-coronavirus-spreads-some-courts-shutter-others-carry-on/?slreturn=20200212085658">prohibiting</a> guests from certain known high-risk areas to enter the courthouse. These policies are all being put in place by individual courthouses but it is certainly good that they feel the freedom to do what’s best for themselves, their staff, the parties appearing before them and guests.

Finally, some individual law schools are taking action. As noted above, nine law schools have pulled out of the AAJ’s competition. West Virginia University has <a href="https://coronavirus.wvu.edu/">announced</a> plans to temporarily suspend classes and move to online instruction. The law school is redirecting to the university’s page and thus would appear to be following suit. Yale Law School is similarly <a href="https://law.yale.edu/emergency-alert">extending</a> spring break and moving to online instruction, as are many others. Individual law schools are taking responsibility for their communities.
<h4>Conclusion: History has its eyes on us</h4>
This is a pinnacle moment. This is a moment in history that could define the next century of legal instruction and legal character. This is a moment that prospective students will be looking to and professionals will forever be defined by. How do we want to present ourselves?

We could choose to hold to our stringent guidelines. We could choose to maintain archaic attendance policies and in-person instruction requirements. We could value some perceived integrity in being inflexible in our methods of instruction, not unlike the proverbial person on the internet saying, “I paid off my student loan debt so why should I forgive yours.” We could continue not to provide accessibility and reasonable accommodation and continue to discourage students who are not “healthy enough” or “tough enough” for law school. We could continue to encourage ego and individualism, self-interest and callousness.

Or we can see this as an opportunity. We can see this as an opportunity to explore new modes of instruction. We can use this to provide accessibility and reach out to the most passionate potential advocates. We can change our perspective and welcome comradery and collaboration over the adversarial individualism that all too often defines our profession.

History has its eyes on us, my friends. Who do we want to be?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court has struggled for decades with how colleges and universities may use racial and ethnic preferences in admissions. At present, the law is this: (1) an institution of higher education may consider the race and ethnicity of applicants as a factor in admissions decisions for purposes of “diversity,” provided that it is not used too mechanically and that all applicants are evaluated on an individualized basis; and (2) a reviewing court is not permitted to give any deference to the college or university when assessing the constitutionality of an admissions program.

The first point stems from the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in the 2003 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-241">University of Michigan law school case</a>. The second is from the Court’s 2013 ruling in the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/11-345">University of Texas case</a>. Unfortunately, the second point has been consistently ignored, including by the Supreme Court itself in a 2016 iteration of the University of Texas case, as courts continue to defer to colleges and universities who continue to dissemble and prevaricate to try to avoid having their affirmative action programs declared illegal.

Recently, the Ohio Advisory Committee to the US Commission on Civil Rights on which I serve approved a report on Education Funding and Civil Rights in Ohio that includes a recommendation that I proposed that, in my opinion, could eventually eliminate the need for affirmative action in higher education admissions. The recommendation is that the US Commission on Civil Rights conduct a study to review the impact of the US Supreme Court’s 1973 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1972/71-1332">San Antonio v. Rodriguez</a> decision.

Although <em>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</em> is largely unknown to all but civil rights specialists, its impact on public education in the US has been profound. In that case, a class-action lawsuit was brought against the state of Texas on behalf of poor families in school districts with a low property tax base. The Supreme Court held in a 5-to-4 decision that (a) poverty is not a “suspect class” protected under anti-discrimination laws, and (b) education is not a fundamental right.

While the Court, therefore, made clear that poverty is not a suspect class, lack of school funding or a grossly disproportionate allocation of funds between school districts may have a disproportionate impact on certain communities whose members largely represent a protected class, such as African Americans or ethnic minorities. Indeed, during our first public hearing, one expert witness lamented that the nation’s highest court found in 1973 that basing education funding on local property taxes did not violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. For this witness, the reason for the Court’s decision was as obvious as it was regrettable: “because then it would become case law for the whole country and they’d have to figure out a way to fund public education.”

Another expert witness raised similar concerns about the 1973 <em>Rodriguez</em> case during our second public hearing, noting “it’s really hard for me to understand how someone would believe that being poor wasn’t a suspect class,” and that “children in poverty, they need additional resources especially if they live in higher concentrations of poverty.” This witness further maintained that the Court was wrong to conclude that education is not a fundamental right: “I believe that you cannot function in today’s democracy or economy without an education. Therefore, what is the role of our society to provide that to a citizen, to provide that to a resident? I think it’s fundamental.”

Frankly, it’s difficult to believe that the Supreme Court could have concluded in <em>San Antonio v. Rodriguez</em> that education is not a fundamental right, given that the most important civil rights decision in the history of the US— <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483">Brown v. Board of Education</a>—was about education. As Justice Thurgood Marshall concisely put it in his dissenting opinion in the Rodriguez case, “the fundamental importance of education is amply indicated by the prior decisions of this Court, by the unique status accorded public education by our society, and by the close relationship between education and some of our most basic constitutional values.” Of course two decades earlier Justice Marshall had argued, and won, <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> as an NAACP lawyer.

With respect to the Court’s decision in the <em>Rodriguez</em> case to reject the claim that the Texas system for funding public schools was unconstitutional because it discriminated against the poor, it defies common sense for the Court to have concluded that the Texas funding system passed constitutional muster because poor children were not subjected to an “absolute deprivation of education.” Justice Marshall again had it right in his dissent when he reminded his wealthy colleagues in the Court’s majority that “every American,” whether he or she be rich or poor, has the constitutional right to “an equal start in life.”

To end where I began, if every student has an equal start in life with a quality education racial and ethnic preferences won’t be necessary in college and university admissions because every student will have been provided with equal educational opportunities from the moment he or she first steps foot in a kindergarten classroom wide-eyed and full of wonderment to the day he or she graduates from college or graduate school fully prepared to be a proud and productive member of society.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Novel Coronavirus, Covid-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has been <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">declared</a> a pandemic by the World Health Organization and is an unprecedented worldwide health crisis. The extent of the ramifications caused is still unclear, but it is evident that the world has come to a standstill. Quarantine and travel bans have been imposed globally. India too has <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-covid-19-80-cities-across-india-go-into-lockdown-till-march-31-what-it-means-2198894">subjected</a> people to legally enforceable quarantine or self-quarantine. It is in this context that mitigation and control of the outbreak of COVID-19 in India are thus of paramount importance not only to India but to the world.

Historically, India has adopted the common law remedies for quarantine enforcement, which has proved to be effective in times of epidemics and pandemics. One of the earliest precedents is found by the en banc decision of United States Supreme Court case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/22us1">Gibbons v. Ogden</a>, wherein the powers of the state to enact quarantine laws and impose health regulations are justified in cases of health emergencies, dangerous diseases, and viral infections. The <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/4219/1/THE-INDIAN-PENAL-CODE-1860.pdf">Indian Penal Code</a> (IPC), deals with offenses affecting the public health safety convenience, decency, and morals, which can be split into two major parts: one dealing with the public nuisance and the other dealing with the quarantine rule. The IPC law is further supplemented by the <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">Epidemic Diseases Act</a>. This law of 1897 was first enacted to tackle the outbreak of the bubonic plague in Mumbai in former British India and is frequently applied to the containment of epidemics like cholera, malaria, dengue fever, and swine flu. The enforcement of quarantine law and clamping of a nation-wide lock-down has been extended from April 14 to May 3, 2020. The concept of quarantine provides for social distancing to contain the spread of the virus and undertake measures to ensure the maintenance of essential services and supplies. The current situation in India amid COVID-19 derives from the Sections 6(2)(1) and 10(2)(1) of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071454/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/DM_Act2005.pdf">Disaster Management Act</a> for the quarantine law enforcement and protection of health.

<strong>REMEDIES UNDER THE COMMON LAW</strong>

The quarantine law and its compliance by people and the state alike can hardly be contested. Courts have always tilted towards the State’s power to enforce. In public health practice, “quarantine” refers to the separation of persons (or communities) who have been exposed to an infectious disease. “Isolation,” in contrast, applies to the separation of persons who are known to be infected. The relevance of the common law remedy in this context is a unique inquiry in contemporary parlance from the perspective of health care services, access to medicines, and therapeutic perception of medical delivery. The provision of a public nuisance under Section 268 of the IPC envisages that a person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does an act which causes any common injury, obstruction, danger, or annoyance to the public. The punishment for public nuisance under Section 290 of the IPC is a fine of ₹200 (INR). It is important to note that ₹200 (INR) was exorbitant when the IPC was adopted one-hundred-sixty years ago. The continuance of public nuisance after the injunction is a case of continuing and subsisting nuisance. Under Section 291 of the IPC, this kind of nuisance is punishable with six months imprisonment, a fine or both.

The application of the IPC is eased by Section 133 of <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1611?sam_handle=123456789/1362">Criminal Procedure Code</a> (CrPC). However, the magistracy is neither dependent on police reports nor on other sources of information, but <em>suo moto</em> can take such evidence as he sees fit.
The Supreme Court of India, in <a href="https://www.escr-net.org/caselaw/2019/municipal-council-ratlam-v-shri-vardhichand-others-1980-air-1622-1981-scr-1-97">Municipal Council Ratlam v. Vardichand</a>, has given a teleological interpretation in the context of the public health safety, convenience, decency, and morals, logically linking Sections 188 and 268 of IPC with Section 133 of CrPC. According to the Court, such a proposition is justified under Section 188 of the IPC:
<blockquote>Besides these substantive provisions, the procedural rigors of Section 133 [CrPC] is more categorical, although it reads discretionary. The judicial discretion, when facts for its existence are present, has a mandatory import. The imperative tone of [133 CrCP] read with the punitive temper of Section 188 IPC makes the prohibitory act an obligatory duty.</blockquote>
The judgment illustrates the transformation of seemingly dull legislation into a robust mandate to protect citizens from epidemics and pandemics alike. It maintains that "decency and dignity are . . . non-negotiable facets of human rights and are the first charge on local self-governing bodies." It is quite unfortunate to note that despite its vast potential, the judgment remains underutilized. The penultimate analysis of colonial law and its teleological interpretation seems highly relevant in the wake of the current lock-down scenario.

<strong>QUARANTINE AND EPIDEMIC LAW ENFORCEMENT IN INDIA</strong>

The IPC was a visionary Code as such a law was not in existence in England at that time. One of the most pivotal segments of containment of public nuisance is the quarantine provision of IPC. Section 188, 269, 270, and 271 of IPC and Section 133 CrPC, assumes pivotal significance in the present scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down orders. The relevant provision relating to a negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life is Section 269 of the IPC: "Whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act knowingly to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life shall be punished with imprisonment of six months and fine or both." Section 270 further provides that any malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life shall be punished for the imprisonment of two years. Section 271 also provides that disobedience of quarantine rule is subject to six months imprisonment or a fine.

On March 11, the Cabinet Secretary of India enforced Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act in all states and union territories in India to control COVID-19. It empowers the state government to take special measures and prescribe regulations as to dangerous epidemic diseases. The Act confers power to the Central Government to take measures and prescribe regulations for the inspection of any ship and detention of a person intending to sail and arrive at any port. Section 3 of the Act prescribes imprisonment of 6 months or a fine, or both (similar to the IPC). The officers acting in good faith to implement the law are protected from any suit or other legal proceeding under Section 4. This colonial law was historically applied in India to control cholera in Gujarat, malaria in Chandigarh, dengue fever in Delhi and swine flu in Pune. The application of the vintage law for containment of COVID-19 pandemic and control of the spread of the infectious disease is an interesting modern application.

<strong>SOCIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19</strong>

The State has a paramount duty for nutrition security, the standard of living, and improvement of public health under Article 47 of the <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/constitution-india/constitution-india-full-text">Constitution of India</a>. The Supreme Court in <u>Municipal Council Ratlam V. Vardichand</u> ruled that in the exercise of such power, the judiciary must be informed by the broader principle of access to justice. The Court relied on egalitarian values from Article 38 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the courts have the right to intervene on the ground of reasonableness and procedural preparedness before enforcement by the State. This question was raised in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/140831979/">Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India</a>, by way of public interest litigation. The writ highlighted the plight of thousands of migrant laborers who, along with their families, were walking hundreds of kilometers from their workplace to their villages and towns in defiance of COVID-19 lock-down order. The jobless and migrant workers stranded without any means of transportation are nothing short of forced detainees in the midland. The police actions under Section 188 of the IPC are justifiable but resulted in abuses against people in need. The sealing of state borders has caused disrupted freedom of movement and halted the supply of essential goods.

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

The COVID-19 outbreak in India is relatively new compared to other countries. Proper surveillance and transparent reporting of the characteristics of infected individuals must occur. When a large proportion of the world, including India, is in lock-down, the countries’ economies are also hard hit. Without a vaccine immediately available to limit the spread, governments and international organizations must come up with a contingency plan. The public health care system in India, with a few exceptions in some states, is abysmal. India <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS">spends</a> just 3.6% of its GDP on public health, lower than some of its smaller neighbors like Nepal. India <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">has</a> only eight doctors per 10,000 people. The best strategy is to be prepared for multiple peaks. Even with the immediate quarantine orders, declaration of national disaster, and nation-wide lock-down, there is still an urgent need for an effective legal mechanism and contingency plan to meet the challenges posed by COVID-19.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[n a time where people are getting seriously ill and dying (and not from a zombie apocalypse), society is faced with the moral question of whether we should release individuals from jails so that we can protect them from contracting, and dying from, COVID-19. It is no secret that<span> </span><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/rikers-coronavirus-cases-increase.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jails</a><span> </span>are a<span> </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/13/833440047/the-covid-19-struggle-in-chicagos-cook-county-jail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotspot</a><span> </span>for COVID-19 incidence, and that incarcerated individuals are among the most<span> </span><a href="http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-science-nature/amy-kapczynski-gregg-gonsalves-alone-against-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vulnerable</a>. Like every individual who has no other card to play, Ken W.Good<span> </span><a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/04/the-covid-19-apocalypse-rules-for-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">throws</a><span> </span>out a hail-Mary appeal to “public safety,” arguing that COVID-19 should not be used as a “get out of jail free” card. He argues that individuals who are released on very low bonds or their personal recognizance are a threat to public safety, and that they are contributing to an uptick in crime since the COVID-19 crisis began. He then dictates several “rules for survival” that counties should follow to protect “public safety.” What he ignores, however, is that individuals who are incarcerated are also members of the public,<span> </span><strong><em>and their safety matters too</em></strong>.

Mr. Good borrows his “rules of survival” from the comedy/zombie apocalypse movie<span> </span><em>Zombieland</em>, and his piece relies on an extended metaphor from the movie. However, Mr. Good fails to mention that<span> </span><em>Zombieland’s</em><span> </span>rules were about personal safety, not public safety—this fatal flaw seriously decapitates Mr. Good’s metaphor. Moreover, Columbus—<em>Zombieland’s</em><span> </span>main character who created the rules for his own survival—broke his own rules numerous times throughout the film. Oh, and Columbus never dies in spite of breaking his rules. Mr. Good’s piece boils down to the untenable suggestion that adherence to strict rules—again, which he gets from a comedy film—are more important than saving people’s lives. In return, we suggest one simple rule: let people go.

Mr. Good, a significant voice of the Texas bail industrial complex, expresses concern over several things: (1) counties have been slowing down arrests; (2) counties have refused to make arrests for certain crimes including theft; and (3) judges have released individuals on extremely low bonds or their own personal recognizance. This, he argues, is particularly problematic in light of the fact that domestic violence reports have surged, burglaries have spiked in Houston, and crimes against businesses have increased in addition to online fraud. He then states that if these concerns go unaddressed, we will see an increase in vigilante justice from the public.

Mr. Good is wrong on all fronts.

First and foremost, crime is<span> </span><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/27/as-coronavirus-surges-crime-declines-in-some-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not</a><span> </span>up.<span> </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marleycoyne/2020/04/11/crime-rates-across-us-drop-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#ddf430311e31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crime</a><span> </span>has<span> </span><a href="https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually decreased</a>. Mr. Good is just trying to escalate the public’s panic surrounding the pandemic as a way for his industry to capitalize on bail bond profits.

Second, his first “rule,” which states that counties should employ a temporary bail schedule, is particularly problematic. Bail schedules typically dictate bond amounts based on the offense an individual is being charged with, or on the maximum sentence for the crime they were arrested for. When an individual is arrested, if they can afford to post bail, they can do so immediately at the police station under a bail schedule without going to jail or to court. Mr. Good touts this as a solution, because, he reasons, individuals will get to avoid jail—and contracting COVID-19, evidently—while awaiting trial.

However,<span> </span><a href="https://www.justia.com/criminal/bail-bonds/bail-schedules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bail schedules</a><span> </span>are extremely rigid and inflexible. When a judge sets bail in court post-arraignment, they can consider factors such as criminal history, employment status, family issues, and ties to the community. Bail schedules consider none of these things.

Another flaw with this “rule” is that individuals are frequently arrested and charged with the most serious crime that the evidence may support, which puts arrestees in higher “brackets” for purposes of bonding out under a bail schedule. Moreover,<span> </span><a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dccc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eighty percent</a><span> </span>of individuals who are arrested and charged with a crime fall below the poverty line, meaning they require a public defender. They cannot afford an attorney, and they are equally unlikely to be able to afford bond. The logical conclusion of Mr. Good’s “rule” is that the wealthy will be able to bond out, as they always have been, and the poor will be left behind. So, nothing new.

It is also important to highlight that Mr. Good offers this “rule” as a purported solution for judges who have, in light of COVID-19, been releasing individuals on very low bonds or on their own recognizance. However, Mr. Good is not a disinterested party in such a “rule.” Which is to say that Mr. Good, a Board Member of the Professional Bondsmen of Texas, is offering a solution that would result in more people purchasing bail bonds, which would put more money in his and other bondsmen’s hands.

Mr. Good’s purported concern with letting people go is “public safety,” but a temporary bail schedule will not do anything to protect the public. He cites—with concern—the fact that someone accused of a violent crime was released on $10 bail. But, setting higher bail amounts does not deter crime, nor is bail supposed to. The sole purpose of setting bail is to ensure that one shows up to their court dates so that the state may prosecute them. In fact, when Kentucky eliminated cash bail altogether, it actually enjoyed a<span> </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/magazine/articles/2014/SLG_0214_Pretrial_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decrease</a><span> </span>in crime connected to pretrial release. Mr. Good cites no sources to prove that his concern about low or no bail amounts provoking vigilante justice is based in reality.

Mr. Good also suggests in his “rules” that all arraignments should be conducted via video conference. While we agree that conducting certain court proceedings via video conference is the safest option for all involved, a far better rule would be to arraign far fewer people. With jails becoming the<span> </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epicenter</a><span> </span>of COVID-19, counties should try to keep as many people out of them as possible, particularly if the individual does not pose a real and present danger to the public.

Mr. Good’s next “rule” essentially suggests that counties should keep track of who entered the jail so they aren’t held longer than the potential sentence their crime could incur. This rule doesn’t go far enough. In the United States, individuals are innocent until proven guilty. Allowing innocent people to sit in jail before court dates that keep getting pushed further and further out is the same as forcing them to play Russian Roulette. More of them will die; it is only a matter of time. For example, two<span> </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/14/second-rikers-island-inmate-dead-from-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">individuals</a><span> </span>incarcerated on Rikers Island in New York City have already died from COVID-19 that they contracted while incarcerated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>"The lockdown is a huge downside for victims exposed relentlessly to their abusers."</em> -Sanya Talwar</p>
It has been said that extenuation for violence will never end. Women have always been the worst sufferers of violence. Disasters, economic crises, and wars have all proven to be more fateful for women than men and exacerbate gender inequality. COVID-19 is no exception to that. This is not the situation of one country; many countries are facing the problem of domestic violence. A study conducted by Marianne Hester, a Bristol University Sociologist, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/sns-nyt-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-rises-worldwide-20200407-6kd46ga4hrfizoxmhz4dmiigja-story.html">suggests</a> that the violence increases whenever families spend more time together.

India’s National Commission for women <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/locked-abusers-india-domestic-violence-surge-200415092014621.html">received</a> an alarming 587 domestic violence complaints between March and April, a significant escalation from the 396 complaints during the month prior. The figures for other countries are also drastic. France reported a thirty-two percent rise in domestic violence during the outbreak. Domestic violence has increased threefold in China’s Hubei Province. New Zealand Police has released statistics demonstrating a twenty percent spike by the first Sunday after their lockdown started. In the US, the National Domestic Violence Hotline received 951 calls during a two-week period in March. Many US law enforcement agencies have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">registered</a> a steep increase since the COVID-19 lockdowns have begun. Even U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061052">asked</a> governments to incorporate some plans to combat domestic violence during this time.

<strong>How Are Courts and Governments Tackling Domestic Violence?</strong>

Countries are developing a proper mechanism to effectively respond to this problem. Though the conditions amidst the pandemic are different and accessibility to courts is difficult, rights for women are not dormant. We rely on the principle <em>Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium</em>, which means that where there is a right, there is a remedy. The courts in India are taking these matters sincerely. Recently, the Jammu and Kashmir High court took <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/high-court-takes-suo-motu-notice-of-lockdown-impact-on-women-73012">notice</a> of the correlation between the lockdown and increased domestic abuse. The Court issued directives to the Secretary, the Department of Social Welfare, and the governments of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. The Court added that special assistance should be provided to the women and children from economically weaker communities.

In India, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (<a href="https://www.icrw.org/files/images/Reducing-HIV-Stigma-and-Gender-Based-Violence-Toolkit-for-Health-Care-Providers-in-India-Annex-4.pdf">PWDVA</a>) was enacted in 2005 to facilitate the protection of women from any type of violence: physical, mental, emotional, verbal, or sexual. Section 8(1) of the act, which may be beneficial during the pandemic, provides for the appointment of Protection Officers. It reads as follows:
<blockquote>The State govt. shall, by notification appoint such no. of protection officers in each district as it may consider necessary and shall also notify the area or area within which a Protection Officer shall exercise the powers and perform the duties conferred on him or under this Act.</blockquote>
Section 5 imposes a duty on police officers, protection officers, service providers or the Magistrate to inform the aggrieved person about his rights. Subsection (d) also requires women to be notified of their right to make a complaint under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/538436/">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

The PWDVA also specifies the duties of shelter homes. It states that the aggrieved person or the protection officers can ask the person in charge of a shelter home to provide proper shelter to a victim. Section 11(a) of the PWDVA holds the government responsible for propagating and giving publicity to the provisions of this act. These measures should be properly put into effect which can be possible only with the help of the government.

The measures taken by the governments during the COVID-19 pandemic are highly applaudable. Argentina has declared pharmacies as safe spaces for victims. The Canadian government <a href="https://www.timminstoday.com/around-ontario/live-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-provides-covid-19-update-2226429">allocated</a> $200 million to Women and Gender Equality, Canada, to support shelter houses and various assault centers. France has carved out a unique way to help victims by providing them hotel rooms and arranging counseling services for them. Further, France will provide €1 million to anti-domestic abuse organizations. In India, the National Commission for Women has launched an alert number (+91 7217735372) for victims to call. Maximizing awareness for this number is essential. Also, non-profits may provide more support if their work is allowed under the umbrella of  “essential services." The United Nations (UN) has also urged governments to designate shelters as essential services.

These measures must be implemented immediately, otherwise, the harm from intimate terrorism will be devastating.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The ongoing battle with Covid-19 seems to be an unending one. As the world grapples with the pandemic, there happen to be those ready to take the fight to the virus itself. Our health professionals, policemen, delivery boys etc. have been constantly working to keep the country up and running in such grave times. Countries all over the globe have been affected by the pandemic and despite taking the best possible measures, the number of people affected and lives lost to the disease only keeps increasing. Especially affected by this pandemic are our frontline warriors, which include our doctors, nurses, policemen and sanitation workers.

We come across Sanitation workers almost on a daily basis. The services they provide us with are very crucial, but are often ignored because of the stigma attached to it. Our doctors, nurses and policemen are lauded for their work, but the efforts of our sanitation workers often go unnoticed. COVID-19 has exposed how vulnerable and underequipped our healthcare system is and the same can be said about our waste management system. While much of the world uses technology and complex machines to treat its waste, this is still largely carried out manually throughout India. Recently in <a href="https://www.mumbailive.com/en/civic/cleaning-workers-wifes-death-due-to-coronavirus-48156">Dharavi</a>, a Sanitation Worker tested positive for COVID-19 as a consequence of which, his wife and son-in-law were infected too which then led to his wife’s death. Masks, gloves and hand soaps are often a luxury to them. Since most of them are employed in the unorganized sector, they are forced by their employers, in this case primarily municipal corporations and contractors, to either work and be paid or be left unemployed.

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/352126/">Article 46</a> of the Constitution mandates that the state is under an obligation to work to uplift the weaker sections of society keeping in mind their educational and economic interests, but when incidents like that of Dharavi come to light, we realize that only so much has been done and that they have been historically deprived of their rights.

<strong>Judicial Approach</strong>

The issue was highlighted when a plea was <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-372892.pdf">filed</a> in the Supreme Court on 9 April, 2020 highlighting the plight of migrant workers amidst COVID-19. The Petitioner Harnam Singh in his Public Interest Litigation (PIL) prayed to the Court to issue necessary directions to the State for Sanitation Workers to be provided with proper kit including gloves, masks, and boots etc., to wear while on duty. Instead of our health workers who work in closed protected environments, they have to deal with what has been discarded by society as waste. Considering that the virus can survive for days on various surfaces if not sanitized, the possibility of these workers contracting the virus from such places increases drastically.

Article 21 of the constitution of India provides for Right to life. It encompasses within itself all such rights necessary for one to live his life with dignity one of which is the Right to Health.

In <em>Consumer Education and Research Centre v. Union of India</em>, the Supreme Court laid down that:
<blockquote>“Social justice which is a device to ensure life to be meaningful and liveable with human dignity requires the State to provide to workmen facilities and opportunities to reach at least minimum standard of health, economic security and civilized living. The health and strength of worker, the court said, was an important facet of right to life. Denial thereof denudes the workmen the finer facets of life violating Art. 21.”</blockquote>
The plea also states that <a href="https://ncsk.nic.in/sites/default/files/manualsca-act19913635738516382444610.pdf">Sections 2(1)(d)</a>, 7 and 9 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013 should be strictly complied with. It implies that if any worker is employed in cleaning of hazardous waste i.e. manual cleaning without any protective gear or any other necessary kit, then the employer can be punished for a period of up to two years and will also be liable to pay a fine of up to two lakh rupees. It may also extend for up to five years of imprisonment or five lakh rupees or both.

Even after the enactment of this act, the unsanitary and dehumanizing practice of cleaning waste manually still continues to this day. The pandemic has changed nothing as even prior to this outbreak they led a life which posed risk to their lives every single day. Addressing the issue of working conditions of sanitary workers/manual scavengers, the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Safai Karamchari Andolan and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.</em> said that the practice of hazardous cleaning is dehumanizing and risks the lives of the people cleaning potholes and picking up garbage with bare hands. The court consequently issued a few guidelines on this concerning issue. These guidelines were:
<ul>
 	<li>Entering sewer lines without proper safety gear should be a criminal liability on part of the employer. Also, in case of death of a worker, his/her family shall be provided a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh.</li>
 	<li>Railways should take responsibility of eradicating the practice of manual scavenging on the tracks.</li>
 	<li>Persons liberated from the practice should not have to wait to receive what is their legitimate due under the law.</li>
 	<li>Support should be provided for a dignified livelihood to women sanitation workers.</li>
</ul>
The Punjab and Haryana High Court took <em>suo moto</em> cognizance in the case of <em>Court on its own motion v. Union of India</em> which suggested that for improving the working conditions of Sanitation workers they should be provided with proper uniforms and be given brooms with sufficiently long handles with the length of the broom being 80-85 cm. The Court also suggested that the solid waste can be treated by composting or by incineration and/or by deploying a bio-methanation process as well as a pyrolysis methodology.

<strong>International Labour Organization (ILO) Guidelines</strong>

The responsibility falls on not just the shoulders of the Government but also on us as a society, to ensure that our workers’ health and economic interests are being taken care of. The Government in this regard should try and push forth implementation of recommendations made by the ILO on the technical advancement, health and hygiene and good working conditions for such workers among other concerning issues.

The ILO issued certain <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_739937.pdf">guidelines</a> for employers and employees on 27th March, 2020 so as to serve the interest of both parties on the subject. The ILO suggests that the onus should be on employers to ensure that all preventive measures are being taken care of so as to reduce the risk of Occupational Hazards by providing the employees with better protective equipment and clothing. However in India, considering the conditions these workers are employed in, it seems unlikely that their lives would hold the same meaning as that of our doctors and nurses.

The ILO has set International Labour Standards wherein guidance is provided for decent working conditions in such crisis. The Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017 (No. 205) is among one such <a href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:3330503">standards</a>. It elaborates crisis responses ensuring human rights, including respect for fundamental principles and rights at work and for International Labour Standards. The recommendation provides for a robust strategy to crisis response that includes immediate employment and social protection measures, and it suggests that Governments all around the globe shall seek to ensure basic income security for individuals whose lives have been disrupted by the ongoing crisis.

<strong>What can be done</strong>

The government should take several affirmative steps including:
<ul>
 	<li>Government should make use of technology and machines to treat medical waste.</li>
 	<li>Raise awareness among such workers on what precautions to take while on duty so as to not come in contact with the virus.</li>
 	<li>They should be provided with proper protective gear while on duty.</li>
 	<li>In case a worker cannot make it to work because of lockdown, the government should ensure that wages are not cut and jobs are not lost.</li>
 	<li>Governments of Delhi and Rajasthan recently declared that if a health professional dies while treating COVID-19 patients, their families would be provided with a compensation of Rs. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/india/news/delhi-cm-announces-1-crore-compensation-to-families-of-health-workers-in-case-of-death/articleshow/74930647.cms">1 crore</a> and <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/rajasthan-govt-announces-rs-50-lakh-compensation-for-staff-who-die-due-to-covid-19-while-on-duty-2573065.html">50 lakhs</a> respectively. A compensation scheme along similar lines should be established for sanitation workers.</li>
 	<li>Suggestions made by the Central Pollution Control Board in Guidelines for Handling, Treatment and Disposable of waste generated during Treatment/Diagnosis/Quarantine of COVID-19 patients should be followed.</li>
</ul>
As of the 20th of April, the central government has issued an advisory to all the states to make sure that sanitation workers are provided with proper IDs/passes for work, are equipped with PPEs and sanitizers and also encouraged them to not touch waste with bare hands and work with protective suits on, maintain a distance of at least 1 meter between them and use disinfectant to clean the gear afterwards.

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>

According to a report by the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis; a statutory body set up by an act of parliament for the welfare of sanitation workers, between 2015 and 2019, one person died every five days on average while manually cleaning sewers and septic tanks across India. This data is from a time when the world wasn’t dealing with a pandemic at large. Considering how contagious and deadly the virus is, it is only going to add to the number of deaths of our sanitation workers if appropriate measures are not taken.

The Indian Government in this regard has undertaken innumerable steps to improve the working and living conditions of our sanitation workers but the implementation of all such policies has been very poor. And in times like these when the country is busy fighting the pandemic on multiple fronts, they can at often times feel neglected.

It is now a known fact that the virus is spreading through respiratory water droplets and from surfaces on which it can survive for hours on end if not for days. Hence it becomes equally important for the government to ensure that anybody dealing with household or medical waste is well equipped so as to not come in contact with the virus while handling its disposal as even a single case of a worker contracting the disease while on duty could prove to be catastrophic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>(KEYWORDS: India; Digital Health System; Rural Areas; Government; Population)</strong>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
Healthcare in India is primarily plagued in remote locations where modern medicine is not easily obtained.   Digital Healthcare has the potential to improve the quality of health care. However, many programs are needed to have a sustainable impact and this is possible if the government supports the initiative.

According to the 15-country <a href="/www.livemint.com/">Future Health Index</a> (FHI), India is a global leader in Digital Health technology. Ironically, research has found that about half (49%) of Indians do not know about the benefit of Digital Healthcare such as mobile health apps, etc.  When Indian healthcare professionals are supported by digital healthcare they receive more exposure to the patient. Telemedicine has led to about 67% of Indian people reporting an increase of convenience and effectiveness when visiting a medical provider who is supported by digital healthcare versus those who are not.  In order to know the benefits and reasons to adopt telehealth, education and information will be critical in taking Indians into this modern digital healthcare era.

World Health Organization (WHO) said that India needs three-times as many doctors than it has now. The current ratio of Doctors to Patients is 1:10,000.  India is now embarking on a venture to bridge this gap by <a href="https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/india-to-become-the-world-leader-in-digital-health/55154100">operating digital health tools</a>.  Telemedicine has the potential to transfigure and modernize the interaction between populations and National Health Services.
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
In the early half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, telemedicine essentially began when ECG data was transmitted over telephone.  The telephone played a crucial role in starting modern medicine as we now know it because it allowed for rapid communication that was not in person. From then to now, digital healthcare has come a long way despite many believing that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/tmj.2010.9964">telemedicine</a> was far away from being able to diagnosis and treat patients. Digital Health has the following key advancements:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>1924, </strong>RADIO NEWS MAGZINE was established so <a href="http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.4258%2Fhir.2015.21.4.223">MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS</a> could communicate with Microphone and TV.</li>
 	<li><strong>1959, </strong>University of Nebraska began to <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586073">transmit neurological examinations</a> via face time video.</li>
 	<li><strong>1997, </strong>Yale University MITAC (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3918958?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Medical Informatics</a> and Technology Applications Consortium) was established.</li>
</ul>
<strong><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1751%28199707/09%2912%3A3%3C236%3A%3AAID-HPM486%3E3.0.CO%3B2-D">NASA and ISRO</a> </strong>also played a major role during the <strong>1985</strong> Mexico City Earthquake and the Soviet Armenia Earthquake in <strong>1988</strong>.

Admittedly, telemedicine is not a solution for all problems faced in Healthcare but it can reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>INITIATIVES IN THE FIELD OF DIGITAL HEALTH</strong></p>
Online mode delivery of Health Services is at the core of the digital health ecosystem. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has been launching many initiatives in the field of Digital Health. Solutions are being introduced to ensure continuity of care, to mitigate the shortage of healthcare resources, and improve the affordability and accessibility of services.  For example:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Vaccine tracker <a href="https://www.immunizeindia.org/">mobile application</a></strong> helps parents track their children’s immunization records<strong>.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>The India fights <a href="https://www.nhp.gov.in/mobile-app-dengue">Dengue mobile App</a> </strong>helps identify symptoms of dengue and connects users to the nearest blood banks and hospitals.</li>
 	<li><strong>The <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhp.ui&amp;hl=en">Swasth Bharat mobile Application</a> </strong>gives information about living a healthy life, diseases and their symptoms, and how various diseases should be treated.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kilkari-project-on-health-advice-to-roll-out-friday/">Kilkaari Application</a></strong> sends audio messages about the pregnancy, birth of child, and care of the child directly to the family of the child.</li>
</ul>
Even more initiatives have been launched by the Indian government that include <strong>ONLINE REGISTRATION SYSTEMS, </strong>such as<strong> <a href="https://www.eraktkosh.in/BLDAHIMS/bloodbank/stockAvailability.cnt">E-RAKT KOSH</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/rishabhnahar6/amn-on-line-anmol-in-health-facility">ANM ONLINE(ANMOL)</a>.  </strong>These will help reduce the stress levels of the public and the medical professionals because of their quick and efficient registration capabilities.

<strong>In 2005</strong>, the National Health Ministry of India set-up various projects like<strong> ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), AROGYASREE (INTERNET-BASED MOBILE MEDICINE)</strong>, <strong>NeHA ( National eHealth Authorities</strong>) <a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_264_19">to achieve high quality health services</a><strong>, VRC( Village Resource Center) </strong>which provide aid in various ways.  For example by connecting multiple hospitals and medical professions from rural and urban areas.<strong>  </strong>ISRO has also developed medical tele-education and a way to easily connect specialty hospitals with expert doctors to the remote villages.

<strong>In 2013, MoHFW </strong>developed an <strong>Electronic Health Record </strong>to ensure safe data records during telemedicine.

Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy or (<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_AYUSH">AYUSH</a></strong>) was implemented in 2015. AYUSH aims to promote the traditional methods of healing to a larger population. This was the backbone of <em><a href="http://www.nihfw.org/NationalRuralHealthMission.aspx">AYUSHMAN BHARAT YOJNA</a>.</em>

As you can see, there are many initiatives that have been developed by the Indian Government to ease the problems arising due to living remotely, where travel is challenging and difficult.
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>APPLICATIONS USED IN DIGITAL HEALTHCARE</strong></p>

<ul>
 	<li><strong>FACE TIME:</strong> Where both sender and receiver are online at the same point of time and “live" transfer of information occurs.</li>
 	<li><strong>STORE AND FORWARD HEALTHCARE TIPS: </strong>Here, the sender sends information to the patient at any convenient point of time so the receiver (patient) can review the data at their convenience.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/technology-changing-health-care-india/">REMOTE MONITORING</a> TYPE DIGI-HEALTHCARE: </strong>or self-testing, this is used for a range of electronic devices to observe the health and clinical signs of a remote patient.</li>
</ul>
Digital Healthcare Applications are permitting professionals to give information to more <a href="https://indiadigitalhealth.net/">unreached patients</a> by giving them access in the palm of their hands.
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
Digital healthcare will not be a solution for all medical problems. However, it can be crucial in improving a vast range of problems. Services like face time, store and forward healthcare tips are proving to be wonders in the field of digital healthcare. National and international digital healthcare initiatives are bringing the world closer. It has proved no barrier in attainment of quality health-care. As such, the Indian Government should maintain a strong interest in further developing Digital Healthcare so that the industry can reach its’ <a href="/yourstory.com/2018/01/boom-digital-healthcare-indias-opportunity-build-global-telemedicine-companies">true potential</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As the coronavirus pandemic unfolds across the globe, threatening lives and upending the world economy, an unexpected side effect has been a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions have plunged due to the rapid decline in travel and economic activities. They are likely to go back up once the pandemic subsides, but this will still have lasting effects on the environment. This can be considered the only positive impact of the coronavirus crisis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">However, the recent polymer gas leak in Vishakhapatnam, India has <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/vizag-gas-leak-what-is-styrene-gas-6398020/">undermined</a> the ecosystem recovery. The tragedy has killed many and injured thousands, and the extent of gas leak's impact is yet unknown. The government has constituted a committee to study the aftermath of the tragedy on public health. The areas within a five</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> kilometer radius</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the plant are said to be affected, and further spread depends on the wind speed. Clearly, the areas within the radius will be inhospitable, as the poisonous gas is believed to affect plantation and the underground water table. The Vizag gas leak is yet more proof of the ignorance of implementation of a right to a healthy environment. Extraordinary situations demand extraordinary decisions and, to date, mankind has not been able to take a righteous stand to protect himself and his right to live in a healthy environment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There is an extensive history of nuclear and chemical hazards that has affected mankind and impeded the right to a healthy environment. </span><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bhopal-gas-tragedy-what-had-happened-this-day-33-years-ago-that-killed-thousands-1099247-2017-12-03"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Bhopal Gas tragedy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in India, which resulted from the escape of toxic methyl isocyanate from the </span>Union Carbide insecticide plant<span>, is regarded as the world’s worst industrial accident, killing thousands.

As a consequence, the entire population of Pripyat, Ukraine was relocated and the town is uninhabitable. </span><span>People</span><span> will not be able to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/topics/reference/chernobyl-disaster/">settle</a> the area near Chernobyl for thousands of years. These fatal incidents, from Chernobyl to Vizag, are compelling examples of why the right to a healthy environment should be a well-recognized right.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Over the past few decades, substantial damage to the environment has increased exponentially, which has affected the wide arena of human rights. While </span><span style="font-weight: 400">there is a large list of civil and political right violations due to environmental degradation, the right to a healthy environment is least discussed. Environmental well-being is prerequisite to uphold the right to life and human dignity. Further, in order for people to remain healthy and lead dignified lives, protection of the environment is pivotal. It is high time that this right attain the status of a fundamental right in the international realm.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The right to a healthy environment was mentioned in the Stockholm Conference as a non-binding principle. The 1972 United Nations Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment </span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/development-of-international-environmental-law/2990481F381AFEDB64B2D564778F1F14%20%0Ahttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/development-of-international-environmental-law/2990481F381AFEDB64B2D564778F1F14%20%0Ahttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/development-of-international-environmental-law/2990481F381AFEDB64B2D564778F1F14"><span style="font-weight: 400">proclaimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, “Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of quality which permits a life of dignity and well-being and bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, it still is a non-binding but recognized right. It is recognized in international and regional conventions, as well as in national laws of some countries.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) partly recognizes the right to a healthy environment under the right to health and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">requires</a> the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">state parties</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to “improve all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene." The Protocol of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">San Salvador</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="http://oas.org/juridico/English/treaties/a-52.html">recognizes</a> the right to live in a healthy environment.  The Inter-American Court of Human Rights <a href="https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/22/issue/6/inter-american-court-human-rights-advisory-opinion-environment-and-human">issued</a> an </span><span style="font-weight: 400">advisory</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> opinion and gave the verdict that the right to a healthy environment is a human right.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The <span>International Network for Economic, Social &amp; Cultural Rights (</span>ESCR-Net) Committee has <a href="https://www.escr-net.org/resources/general-comment-14">stated</a> in </span><span style="font-weight: 400">General Comment 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> that the right to a healthy environment includes precautionary procedures in respect to occupational accidents and diseases; the obligation to guarantee an adequate supply of clean water; basic sanitation; and the prevention and diminution of the population’s exposure to detrimental substances, such as radiation and harmful chemicals, or other unfavorable ecological surroundings that directly or indirectly effect human health.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The 1972 Stockholm Conference was very important, as it marked the first essential step towards recognizing this right. Since the U.N. Conference in 1972, about </span><span style="font-weight: 400">155 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> have <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=3349&amp;context=nrj">incorporated or recognized</a> the right to a healthy environment into their constitutions, in changeable formulations. The recognition and inclusion of the right to a healthy environment in constitutions and legislation is definitely a progressive step. However, this progressive step can turn into a futile one, discerning the number of cases being brought to the attention of UN Human Rights mechanism. The national, as well as international, policy arrangements and implementation measures regarding the right to a healthy environment are insufficient. They are also ineffective, because they are not implemented in many countries, especially the developed ones. Also, the implementation method is inefficacious, owing to the lack of resources, technology, and support from the international arena. Indeed, the connection between environment, health, and the whole arena of human rights is being well established worldwide in the form of various laws, treaties, conventions, and legislation. These are well accepted by states when implemented in practice, and their violations are well-recognized by the courts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The upsurge of environmental hazards undoubtedly shows the passive approach of most countries towards the need of a healthy environment, but it is worth mentioning that there are a few countries that have responded to the environmental degradation with strong legal measures. Kenya, Rwanda, France, and Morocco are a few but inspiring examples of proper implementation of a <a href="https://www.earthday.org/lessons-from-the-countries-fighting-to-kick-the-plastic-bag-addiction/">ban</a> on </span><span style="font-weight: 400">plastic usage</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Mexico City took a commendable approach to reduce air pollution by banning all vehicles once every month. Although the developed countries are considered the mainspring basis for major environmental hazards, surprisingly, the United States ranks third in the Environmental Democracy Index. It is considered one of the best countries for environmental protection due to stringent legislation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While acknowledging the lack of implementation of the existing environmental laws, it would be unfair not to mention Lithuania, which tops the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Environmental Democracy Index</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The inflexible and stern environmental laws of Lithuania set an ideal for other countries to follow. In Lithuania, people have the right to access information related to the environment and approach the court if their rights are being violated. The Environmental Protection Laws of Lithuania <a href="https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/640451">entitle</a> the people to challenge the government if their environmental rights are being violated. The governmental authorities need to gather input from the people in order to determine the policies that may affect their environment.</span>

<b>CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The need for a healthy environment may not be realized yet by many countries, but the upsurge of chemical and nuclear hazards corroborates that governments need to introduce rigid laws on the right to a healthy environment, so that the disastrous history of Chernobyl or Bhopal may not repeat itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">After the disastrous Bhopal Gas tragedy in 1984, the Supreme Court of India took a noteworthy stand and evolved the rule of </span>absolute liability<span style="font-weight: 400"> in the 1986 </span><a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1486949/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Oleum gas leak case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such strong legal opinion not only deliberates the importance of formulation and implementation of stringent environmental laws, but also prevents the violation of the right to a healthy environment. However, the Vizag gas leak incident is sufficient to show the ignorance of mankind towards his rights, as well as duties, to the environment. Proceeding from the disastrous tragedies of the Bhopal gas leak and the Vizag styrene gas leak, the continued ignorance of the need for a right to a healthy environment can be reflected in the lack of implementation of environmental laws adopted by the states.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of the primary reasons behind the failure of recognition and implementation of a right to a healthy environment in the states is the lack of a proper compliance mechanism. In order to tackle the upsurge of environmental hazard and to bring about the actual consciousness of the governments about the importance of a right to a healthy environment, it is imperative that the compliance mechanism is analyzed. The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">non-acceptance of the compliance mechanism should ensure a responsibility. The proper dispute settlement procedures would also pave the way for a strong compliance mechanism. Only the proper compliance mechanism would lay the foundation for the implementation of the right to a healthy environment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The policies and legislation encompassed by the countries at the peak of the Environmental Democracy Index should serve as an ideal for other countries. This would, in turn, pave the way for other countries to properly realize their right to achieve a healthy environment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An environment conducive for healthy well-being is an indispensable requirement. It should be the duty of the states to take concrete measures to ensure the realization of the basic human right to live in a healthy environment. States should formulate procedures that allow the citizens to take action against the violation of their rights. The individuals should have access to the information regarding the environment. They should have a say in the decision making and policy issues which may considerably affect the environment in which they live. Legal remedies should be made available for those whose rights have been violated, and proper redress should be available. To attain this goal, cooperation on individual level as well as from the corporate and public sectors is essential. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The enactment of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1790/text">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020</a> (NDAA) was undoubtedly a historic moment – one ceasing perpetuation of the nearly 70 years of disparate treatment to which certain military personnel suffering the harms of medical malpractice incident to their service had previously been subjected as the result of an archaic, widely-criticized doctrine annunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/340/135/">Feres v. US</a> (the Feres Doctrine). As set forth below, the Feres Doctrine, prior to the enactment of the NDAA, barred claims by military personnel under the <a href="https://www.house.gov/doing-business-with-the-house/leases/federal-tort-claims-act">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FTCA) seeking compensation for injury or death suffered “incident to service” caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government.

<strong>FTCA &amp; The Feres Doctrine </strong>

The sovereign immunity of the US was largely curtailed in 1946 with the passage of the FTCA, which renders the US <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">liable</a>
<blockquote>for money damages ... for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>
The plain text of the FTCA does not proscribe claims by military personnel and, to the contrary, expressly renders the US liable to <em>all</em> persons suffering a personal injury or death as a result of a “negligent or wrongful act or omission of <em>any</em> employee of the Government...” (italics added).  None of the exceptions to the FTCA generally preclude claims brought by military personnel and, in fact, one exception demonstrates that the legislature considered, and expressly provided provisions to address, the special nature and requirements of the military, by <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680">excluding</a>: "Any claim arising out of the <em>combatant activities</em><span><em> </em></span>of the military or naval forces, or the Coast Guard,<span> </span><em>during time of war.</em>" (italics added).

The unambiguous text of the FTCA, and intent of the legislature, was augmented by the Supreme Court in <em>Feres v. US</em>. In an act of heedless, unwarranted judicial activism based on conjecture and speculation of what the legislature intended, despite the clear meaning of what it actually enacted, the Supreme Court disregarded the plain text of the FTCA by creating an exception, which precludes Government liability “under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.”

The court provided three reasons purporting to support the Feres Doctrine: (1) the parallel private liability required by the FTCA was absent, (2) Congress could not have intended that local tort law governs the “distinctively federal” relationship between the Government and military personnel, and (3) Congress could not have intended to make FTCA claims available to military personnel who have already received veterans’ benefits to compensate them for injuries suffered incident to service. Several years later a fourth reason was <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/348/110/">articulated</a>: "The peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, [and] the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline..."

The only one of these rationales with even scant textual support is the first. The US is liable “in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances...” and the jurisdiction of the district courts is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">limited</a> to claims against the US for losses “under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable...”  Since no private individual has the power to conscript or mobilize a private army, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2674">28 U.S.C.A. § 2674</a> would shield the US from liability for, and deprive the district courts of jurisdiction over, the particular claims asserted in <em>Feres v. US</em>, which sought to recover for negligence, against either [the plaintiff’s] superior officers or the Government he is serving.”

The problems with extrapolating this reasoning are plentiful. First, it would <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/681/">render</a> many of the exceptions to the FTCA superfluous “since private individuals typically do not, for example, transmit postal matter, 28 U.S.C. § 2680(b), collect taxes or customs duties, § 2680(c), impose quarantines, § 2680(f), or regulate the monetary system, § 2680(i).”  Second, it <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/350/61/">fails</a> to consider the character and nature of the activity giving rise to the claim and, instead, “predicat[es] liability on a completely fortuitous circumstance – the presence of identical private activity.” (rejecting the “parallel private liability” rationale articulated in <em>Feres</em>).

The two other rationales articulated by the Supreme Court to support the Feres Doctrine have been criticized as being mere speculation of the legislative intent embodied in the FTCA based on the scant, subsequently <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/350/61/">rejected</a> textual support underlying the “parallel private liability” rationale, both of which have now been <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/52/">described</a> as “no longer controlling.” In tacit recognition of the frailty of the only rationales actually articulated by the court in <em>Feres,</em> it has repeatedly cited the subsequently contrived “military discipline” rationale as the “best” explanation for its decision in <em>Feres </em>and, more generally, the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/52/">continued</a> application of the Feres Doctrine.

The <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/481/681/">reasoning</a> underlying the “military discipline” rationale is that “[a]pplying the FTCA as written would lead ... to absurd results, because if suits could be brought on the basis of alleged negligence towards a serviceman by other servicemen, military discipline would be undermined and civilian courts would be required to second-guess military decision making.” Neither the three original reasons articulated in <em>Feres</em>, nor the post hoc rationalization of “military discipline,” justify the failure to apply the FTCA as written and, as especially pertinent here, to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">permit</a> claims by all persons, including military personnel, whether active duty or not, for injury or death caused by the medical malpractice “of any employee of the Government ..."

<strong>The Limited Exception To The Feres Doctrine Created By The NDAA</strong>

The NDAA created a limited <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2733">exception</a> to the Feres Doctrine “for personal injury or death incident to the service of a member of the uniformed services that was caused by the medical malpractice of a Department of Defense health care provider,” provided that the “act or omission constituting medical malpractice occurred in a covered military medical treatment facility." The term “Department of Defense health care provider” <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2733">means</a> “a member of the uniformed services, civilian employee of the Department of Defense, or personal services contractor of the Department [of Defense] ...” while a “covered military treatment facility” <a href="https://manuals.health.mil/DisplayManualPdfFile/MD09/8/ChangeOnly/MD09/c55s1073d.pdf">includes</a> certain military medical treatment facilities maintained by the Secretary of Defense.

While the NDAA certainly chips away at some of the unfortunate consequences of the Feres Doctrine, at least insofar as medical malpractice claims are concerned, the plain terms of its text do not extend to claims against the US for personal injury or death incident to the service of a member of the uniformed services that either: (a) occurred in a medical treatment facility other than a “covered military treatment facility,” such as one maintained and operated by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or (b) was caused by the medical malpractice of a civilian employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs or a personal services contractor of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The latter is worrisome since the Department of Veterans Affairs enters into agreements with medical education programs to <a href="https://www.va.gov/oaa/gme_default.asp">train</a> its neophyte matriculants:
<blockquote>In Academic Year 2017, 43,565 medical residents, 24,683 medical students, 463 Advanced Fellows, and 849 dental residents and dental students received <strong>some or all of their clinical training in VA</strong>.</blockquote>
The NDAA either reflects an intention of the legislature to leave members of the uniformed services without recourse for harms suffered incident to their service caused by the medical malpractice of untrained medical residents and students, among others, or <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/persona/active_duty.asp">demonstrates</a> ignorance that “VA health care facilities are available to active duty service members in emergency situations and upon referral by military treatment facilities through Sharing Agreements or under your TRICARE coverage,” meaning active-duty members of the uniformed services may suffer harms incident to their service caused by the medical malpractice of healthcare providers other than those contemplated by the NDAA at medical facilities other than those contemplated by the NDAA.

<strong>The Solution</strong>

The inadequacies of the exception to the Feres Doctrine enacted as part of the NDAA arise from the attempt of the legislature to rework the pre-existing text of the FTCA by replacing the phrase “employee of the Government” (a phrase defined by 28 U.S.C.A. § 2671) with “Department of Defense health care provider,” and imposing a geographical limitation by limiting recovery to those fortuitous enough to have suffered harms as the result of mistreatment “in a covered military medical treatment facility.”  To correct these inadequacies, the legislature should: (a) remove the geographical limitation since any necessary geographic limitations are already set forth in 28 U.S.C.A. § 2680(k) (stating that the FTCA does not apply to “[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country”); (b) replace the phrase “a Department of Defense health care provider” with “any employee of the Government;” and (c) amend the definition of the phrase “employee of the Government” to include personal services contractors, such as the medical residents, students and fellows receiving their training on current and former members of the uniformed services at medical facilities maintained and operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

		<title>Enforcing the Constitutional Limits on the Pardon Power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the conviction and sentencing of Roger Stone, for obstructing the congressional inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham suggested that President Donald Trump “has all the legal authority in the world to review this case, in terms of commuting the sentence or pardoning Mr. Stone for the underlying offense.” But this is not quite right. In fact, there are constitutional limits on the president’s pardon power, though enforcement of those limits may be far from certain.

In their recent essay <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/68900/is-the-pardon-power-unlimited/">Is the Pardon Power Unlimited?</a>, Professor Harold Hongju Koh and a raft of his Yale Law School students explain that Trump’s advisors should counsel the president against pardoning his friend, Stone—and the House of Representatives should seriously consider launching a new impeachment inquiry in the not-unlikely event Trump declines to follow that advice. Though the essay’s authors spell out the constitutional limits on the pardon power, at the same time the piece could provide support for the view that, should Trump pardon Stone, the <em>only</em> recourse would be impeachment.

But there is an argument that, regardless of the possibility of impeachment, the courts should not honor a Stone pardon. Like the authors of <em>Is the Pardon Power Unlimited?</em>, Professor Corey Brettschneider <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/27/trump-pardon-roger-stone-constitution-117757">has</a><span> argued</span> that the president’s pardon authority is not without limit: “once a president has been impeached, he or she loses the power to pardon anyone for criminal offenses connected to the articles of impeachment—and … even after the Senate’s failure to convict the president, he or she does not regain this power.” The constitution, in other words, “prevents the worst abuse of the pardon power: a president’s protecting cronies who have been convicted of crimes related to the president’s own wrongdoing.” Brettschneider reasons that, given that Stone’s obstruction of justice occurred in the context of the Mueller investigation of Russian involvement in the 2016 election, and the recent articles of impeachment against Trump focused on the president’s alleged “abuse of power,” the same “general high crime [is] at play in Ukraine and elsewhere that links the impeachment and Stone.”

Though the connection between Stone’s actions and the basis for the first Trump impeachment might not be quite as close as Brettschneider maintains, still it seems unlikely the framers believed the president ought to be able to wield the pardon power to protect himself. The real question, of course, is how to enforce any constitutional limit. Aside from impeachment, there are essentially two potential enforcement options: the democratic check and the judicial check.

The democratic check is the next presidential election. Should Trump seek to pardon Stone prior to November, the move could become an issue that galvanizes voters; there is a reason that presidents generally save their pardons for their last days in office. Of course, if Trump likes his reelection prospects – and believes those prospects would be improved if he did not pardon Stone before the election – he could simply wait and issue the pardon after he is sworn in for a second term as president. In that case, thanks to the 22d Amendment’s two-term limit on serving as president, Trump would pay no electoral price for a Stone pardon.

The courts could also check abuse of the pardon power by declining to enforce a Stone pardon on constitutional grounds. As an initial matter, and assuming a second-term pardon, when democracy can no longer serve as a check, a court would have to be convinced that the remedy of impeachment is essentially contingent. As Koh et al. put it in <em>Is the Pardon Power Unlimited?</em>, “what may be legally possible, can always be deemed politically difficult or unwise.” This is not to discount the strong case in favor of impeachment should Trump pardon Stone. Koh at al. are correct that, should Trump win in November and the Democrats hold the House, the Democrats should not tolerate pardons of witnesses who sought to shield Trump from an investigation by both the special counsel and various House committees. It remains, however, that all of these considerations still might not be enough for Democrats to launch another impeachment investigation of Trump—hence the reason the impeachment remedy should be seen as contingent.

It is because an impeachment inquiry into abuse of the pardon power is contingent that the courts should decline to enforce a Stone pardon. Otherwise, the president could use the pardon power, particularly in a second term, to undermine the separation of powers. The constitution contemplates congressional oversight as the means by which to keep the president appropriately accountable when, for example, executive officers have failed to secure the nation’s electoral process against foreign intervention—as much, or perhaps more, of a threat today than in 2016. It is difficult to imagine that the Framers would have approved of a president who sought to undermine Congress’s ability to perform this constitutional function by rewarding with a pardon witnesses who would lie or otherwise thwart legitimate and rational legislative inquiries, solely in order to protect the president personally—which is precisely what a jury found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Roger Stone did.

At the end of the day, there is a world of difference between, on the one hand, a pardon that smacks of favoritism and, on the other, one that allows executive action to escape meaningful review by the department of government responsible for such review. Only the latter pardon works to subvert the constitutional design. As Justice Robert Jackson noted, in a different context, courts should not be asked to bless an executive action “that has no place in law under the Constitution.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What did the American public understand the word “sex” to mean in 1964?

That’s the foundational question before the Supreme Court in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/r-g-g-r-harris-funeral-homes-inc-v-equal-opportunity-employment-commission/">Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC</a>. This case originated when Harris Funeral Homes hired a male funeral director who agreed to follow the company’s sex-specific dress policy. Nearly six years later, the director informed the funeral home’s owner of an intent to dress and present as a woman while interacting with grieving families. The outcome of <em>Harris</em> hangs on whether the Supreme Court applies textualism: interpreting a law according to its public meaning at the time of enactment.

Signed into law in 1964, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> of the Civil Rights Act forbids employers from discriminating against employees based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. On any street corner in America, the public meaning of “sex” in 1964 was clear: biologically male or female, based on genetics. That much is obvious from a look at the dictionary definitions in use at the time—biologically-based definitions that are still in use today by professional groups such as the American Psychiatric Association.

So, if a majority of the justices take a textualist approach—that is, they decide <em>Harris</em> based on the public meaning of the law at the time of its enactment—Title VII should mean that an employer cannot treat women worse than men because they are women, or vice versa. Because the funeral home would not allow a female funeral director to dress and present as a male, it should prevail.

As simple as this seems, those who hope the high court will rewrite Title VII have twisted textualism and argued that a textualist approach yields the opposite result. For example, Georgetown University Law Professor Nan D. Hunter <a href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2019/12/05/sex-and-the-text-what-could-carry-the-day-in-the-supreme-courts-title-vii-cases/">unearthed an archived transcript</a> of a 1962 meeting where a single congresswoman, Rep. Edith Green, D-Ore., made mention of a female employee in Britain who announced an intent to begin presenting as male at a government job and then received a pay increase as a result. Green called that the “ultimate in discrimination.” (In the end, Green ultimately voted <em>against </em>including the word “sex” in Title VII at all, something Hunter’s article curiously omits.)

Convinced she has a smoking gun, Hunter concludes that textualism now demands that the Supreme Court rule against Harris Funeral Homes. In other words, business owners in the 21st century should be held to the standard of what was in the mind of each particular congressional member more than half a century ago. This would be comical if the consequences of redefining “sex” in federal law were not so serious.

Hunter’s analysis has two problems. To begin, it’s not clear whether Green’s comment indicated her belief that the British employee’s treatment even amounted to “sex” discrimination. She may have simply been upset that men were being paid more than women.

More important, textualism requires analyzing how an ordinary American with a reasonable command of the English language would understand a prohibition on “sex” discrimination when Title VII was enacted. The fact that a single member of Congress in 1962 may have considered “sex” discrimination to encompass what happened in Britain does not alter the statute’s original public meaning. No justice who faithfully applies textualism would rely on a single legislator’s subject intent; doing so is the exact <em>opposite</em> of applying a statute’s words based on their original public meaning.

When fairly interpreting those statutory words, it is equally fanciful for Hunter’s article to say that, after the funeral director expressed a desire to dress and present as a woman, the director’s sex “changed.” An ordinary American at the time of Title VII’s enactment would not have understood sex to be changeable. That is why the director’s counsel conceded in merits briefing that—like it or not—Title VII considers the director to be male, not female.

If accepted, arguments like Hunter’s are a radical reimaging of “sex” in federal law. Text that requires women and men to be treated equally would now require an employer to treat a man <em>as </em>a woman. Text in Title IX would require a school to allow a boy identifying as a girl to take a girl’s place on the women’s basketball team or the winner’s podium. Text in public accommodation laws would require a women’s shelter to allow a man identifying as a woman to sleep in the same room with women who have been raped, trafficked, and abused.

Even Hunter doesn’t suggest that an ordinary American would have understood a prohibition on sex discrimination to mean all <em>that</em> at the time of Title VII’s enactment. And it is precisely why textualists do not try to speculate what may have been in the minds of lawmakers from days gone by.

		<title>Cannabis Companies are Overlooking Data Security Laws and Regulations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The state-legal cannabis industry has been slowly crawling into existence over the past decade. Despite federal illegality, most states have legalized medical cannabis and about a dozen states have legalized adult-use cannabis. For compliant cannabis businesses, becoming operational is no easy endeavor and may lead to myopic compliance that fails to consider essential business practices, such as compliance with data security laws.

For background, in almost all states that have medical or recreational cannabis programs, becoming licensed and operational is a grueling process that can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Prospective cannabis businesses will need to negotiate and secure leases, undergo facility build outs and improvements, endure local land-use and permitting processes, navigate state licensing processes, pay state and local application and annual license fees, compile dozens of business plans and standard operating procedures, and comply with regulations from usually at least a few different state agencies and local governments. Licensing is also often competitive, exponentially raising the cost on applicants.

All of the foregoing combined can impose tunnel vision on licensing applicants when it comes to regulatory compliance. Meaning, given what it takes to just get licensed, licensees often overlook other, important laws and regulations that apply to any other business, especially if they are not directly incorporated directly into cannabis laws and regulations.

This kind of thinking can be incredibly dangerous for new cannabis companies. For example, companies who do not consider the impact of federal employment laws risk serious and costly employee litigation. The same goes for virtually any other kind of federal or state law that applies to every single business in the U.S. One such area where cannabis companies are likely to face a host of issues in the next few years is data security. The U.S. does not have an omnibus data protection law, and because most states and local jurisdictions do not impose independent data protection requirements on cannabis licensees, cannabis companies oftentimes do not even consider data security. The likely result of this will be (1) data breaches, (2) consumer litigation, and (3) government enforcement actions.

Data breaches are the most likely thing that will occur for cannabis businesses. A breach can range from anything from malicious hacking to the simple loss of a laptop containing certain protected categories of “personal information”. For example, California’s <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1798.82">data breach statute</a> protects information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers, as well as medical information and bio-metric information.

If protected information is the subject of a data breach, the breached business has a duty to notify the data subject and provide certain statutory services to them. Because each state’s laws are different, the time to notify, manners in which notification much be given, requirements to provide supplemental notices to state regulators, and services (i.e., identity theft mitigation services) that need to be provided can range significantly. Simply figuring out what kinds of, and whose, information may have been accessed could take tens—if not hundreds—of thousands of dollars in forensic review.

It was <a href="https://thecitizenng.com/analysis-data-breaches-compromised-4-5bn-records-in-half-year-2018-gemalto/">estimated</a> that in the first half of 2018, 4.5 billion records were exposed in data breaches generally, meaning that breaches are a phenomenon that are not unique to the cannabis industry. However, unlike in traditional industries, cannabis companies may be particularly susceptible to data breaches for a host of reasons.

First, cannabis companies may be unwilling to report breaches to federal authorities in light of the federal illegality of cannabis. This may result in further damages to the company or the failure to apprehend cyber criminals.

Second, given the lack of access to banking throughout the cannabis industry because of federal illegality and federal anti-money laundering laws, cannabis businesses may use less-than-reputable electronic banking sources that are susceptible to breaches or ransomware attacks. Likewise, states generally adopt track-and-trace requirements for cannabis businesses (to track inventory and cash) that force businesses to use software that itself could be the subject of an attack. In California, businesses generally <a href="https://casetext.com/regulation/california-code-of-regulations/title-16-professional-and-vocational-regulations/division-42-bureau-of-cannabis-control/chapter-1-all-bureau-licensees/article-6-track-and-trace-requirements/section-5050-loss-of-connectivity">cannot operate</a> if they cannot access the track-and-trace software, so even minor breaches could lead to chaos.

Third, state attorneys general may need to be notified of certain data breaches. If an attorney general in one state in which cannabis was not legal receives notice that attorney general’s state citizens were the victims of a data breach by a cannabis business in an entirely different state, the notified attorney general may want to target that cannabis business with an enforcement action.

Fourth, it is unlikely that a wide array of cannabis companies will have cyber liability insurance, which could save large costs of forensic review or providing required services in the event of a data breach. A large-scale breach requiring significant forensic review and consumer services could destroy a cannabis business.

In addition to data breaches, cannabis companies—at least in California—are likely to soon face consumer litigation. California’s new Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) creates private rights of action with <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;sectionNum=1798.150.">statutory damages of $100 to $750 or actual damages</a> for consumers whose data was breached, if the company holding that data failed to implement reasonable data security measures. Given that data breaches are all but guaranteed to occur in the cannabis industry, so too will consumer class-action litigation.

Consider the following example: a dispensary with personal information of 5,000 customers is the victim of a data breach, and the dispensary has not taken any steps to secure the customers’ personal information. Statutory damages in a class-action lawsuit could be up to $3,750,000.  This would be fatal to many cannabis businesses given the already astronomical costs of regulatory compliance and licensing fees.

Not only is consumer litigation likely, but so too are governmental enforcement actions. As noted above, many states’ data breach laws require reporting to state attorneys general, who can decide whether to follow up with investigations or who may initiate enforcement actions. This could mean that a cannabis business located exclusively in Southern California that served tourists from Indiana or Louisiana, for example, could find itself subject to an enforcement action by Indiana or Louisiana regulators if those states’ citizens were at all compromised in the breach.

In sum, though data security obligations are traditionally not imposed on cannabis companies as part of the permitting or licensing processes in most jurisdictions, they are still imposed on such companies by operation of law. Narrow consideration of only those cannabis regulations which immediately affect cannabis businesses will lead to devastating but avoidable losses for cannabis businesses. In turn, cannabis businesses should prepare now for the data security laws that already apply to them before they’re bankrupted by a breach, litigation, or an enforcement action.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/special-coverage-of-covid-19/">coronavirus pandemic</a>, law schools face an existential crisis. After shuttering their buildings and moving their classes online, they must ask whether they can and should assign grades for the spring 2020 semester. Many have already <a href="https://www.law.com/2020/03/18/law-schools-adopt-pass-fail-grades-as-they-move-online-amid-covid-19/">decided</a> to go pass/fail. And many more are sure to follow. But I don’t believe in doing things by half-measures. All law schools should go pass/fail for all classes, and never go back.

Grades are the alpha and omega of law school. The overwhelming majority of law schools grade students on a strict curve. Those grades enable law schools to rank their students in relation to each other. And they enable law schools and employers to determine at a glance whether a student is a winner or a loser.

Law schools love grades because employers love grades, and law schools love nothing more than sucking up to employers. Many law students love grades because grades made them winners. And Stockholm syndrome says some law students even learn to love grades, hoping they might become a winner someday. After all, who doesn’t want to be on top?

But why? What is the purpose of law school grades? Or rather, what is the purpose of the curve? Sententious administrators always say grades make students work harder and provide feedback on their performance.

I disagree. The curve means that grades are about competition, not learning. The curve means that our job is picking winners and losers, not teaching. The curve means that we are all just flunkies of the employers.

To hell with that. The only legitimate purpose of law school is training good lawyers. We don’t need to rank our students to ensure they are competent.

For better or worse, law schools have always been professional schools. Most law school graduates become practicing attorneys. In theory, the bar exam tests minimal competence to practice. What do law school grades measure? Who knows. Many other professional schools adopted pass/fail grading a long time ago. Why should law schools be any different?

Let’s be honest. Law school grades merely reflect the hierarchy that pervades the profession. In a battle of all against all, everyone wants to come out on top, or at least in a reasonably comfortable position. If it means someone’s the loser, them’s the breaks.

But the hierarchy itself is artificial and absurd. After all, the “best” law school in the country ostentatiously refuses to grade its students on the mandatory curve its peers feel obliged to adopt. Why? When you’ve got it, flaunt it.

Why let the winner define the game? Why accept a hierarchy that exists for the purpose of creating winners and losers, rather than evaluating competence? Well, it’s hard to defect when everyone else is playing the game. Everyone knows the system is rotten, but no one wants to make the first move.

Here’s an idea. Law schools should go pass/fail this semester. And they should stay that way. Sometimes, it takes a crisis to enable a change that is long overdue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Is it an end that draws near or a beginning?" - Karl Jaspers, <em>Man in the Modern Age</em> (1951)</blockquote>
There are times when a grievous threat can menace friends and enemies alike. Still, in these conspicuously "bad times," such a potent threat can also bring adversaries to once-unimagined levels of cooperation. The current and ongoing coronavirus onslaught represents just such a prospectively unifying threat.

Plainly, though we ought never to assume that this sort of menace should be welcomed or applauded (after all, the immediate protection of human life must always be our overriding objective), it could nonetheless spark certain valuable forms of global cohesion and solidarity.

This policy promise can now be assessed in more specifically analytic terms. In principle, at least, exploiting the pathogenic challenge of coronavirus could help to prevent war (whether conventional or <a style="cursor: help" title="For authoritative early accounts by this author of nuclear war effects, see: Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: U.S. Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1984); and Louis René Beres, Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1986). Most recently, by Professor Beres, see: Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (New York, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; 2nd ed. 2018)">nuclear</a>) and terrorism (including, in an additional irony, bio-terror attacks). At present, unassailably, this unwanted and unwitting benefactor confronts humankind <em>in toto</em> and without regard for any national, racial, ethnic, religious or ideological differences.

There will also be relevant issues of operationalization. The coronavirus pandemic could become a genuine source of long-sought human unity, but how exactly would it happen? This query, fraught with substantial jurisprudential content, merits very serious attention. It's not just a silly or offhanded thought.

<em>Credo quia absurdum</em>, said the ancient philosophers. “I believe because it is absurd.” However counter-intuitive, the incontestable commonality of coronavirus disease threat could underscore and animate the creation of a more authentically planet-centered world politics. As a potentially significant remedy against <a style="cursor: help" title="See especially: RESOLUTION ON THE DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION, Dec. 14, 1974, U.N.G.A. Res. 3314 (XXIX), 29 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 31) 142, U.N. Doc. A/9631, 1975, reprinted in 13 I.L.M. 710, 1974; and CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, Art. 51.. Done at San Francisco, June 26, 1945. Entered into force for the United States, Oct. 24, 1945, 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993, Bevans 1153, 1976, Y.B.U.N. 1043.">aggression</a> and related crimes, it’s not nearly as contrived or fanciful as it may first appear.

Where precisely are we today? Donald Trump's US remains expressly oriented toward the opposite of global community, solidarity or what Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardon (<em>The Phenomenon of Man</em>) calls "planetization." Indeed, this president's incessant focus on witting postures of belligerent nationalism represents a rancorous rejection of all human commonality. <em>Inter alia</em>, this ill-fated rejection has absolutely no recognizable basis in <a style="cursor: help" title="According to Blackstone, each state is always expected 'to aid and enforce the law of nations, as part of the common law, by inflicting an adequate punishment upon offenses against that universal law....' See: 2 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 4, 'Of Public Wrongs.' Lest anyone ask about the significance of Blackstone for current US national security policies, one need only point out that Commentaries were an original and core foundation of the laws of the United States.">law</a>.

It is high time to inquire intellectually and honestly: What are the expected consequences of believing that one “powerful” country can or should prosper at the tangible expense of other countries? Left unmodified, the most palpable effect of this American president’s policies based upon unceasing conflict will be a starkly accelerating tribalism here on <a style="cursor: help" title="'There is no longer a virtuous nation,' warns the poet William Butler Yeats, 'and the best of us live by candlelight.'">earth</a>. To the extent that the corrosive effects of this tribalism could sometime even display or ignite a credible nuclear dimension, these effects (whether suddenly or incrementally) could propel the US toward various irretrievable forms of <a style="cursor: help" title="Though composed in the seventeenth century, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan still offers a timeless vision of chaos in world politics. Says the English philosopher in Chapter XIII, 'Of the Natural Condition of Mankind, as concerning their Felicity, and Misery:' During chaos, a condition which Hobbes identifies as a 'time of War,' it is a time '...where every man is Enemy to every man... and where the life of man is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.' At the time of writing, Hobbes believed that the condition of 'nature' in world politics was less chaotic than that same condition existing among individual human beings -because of what he called the 'dreadful equality' of individual men in nature being able to kill others - but this once-relevant differentiation has effectively disappeared with the global spread of nuclear weapons.">chaos</a> and catastrophe.

On the other hand, a firm rejection of American tribalism in every one of its markedly injurious expressions could prove generally gainful.

Ultimately, if we humans are going to merely survive as a species, truth must win out decisively over political wizardry. An irresistible conclusion here is that American continuance and prosperity are inextricably linked with a much wider global impact. To wit, it is profoundly and unforgivably foolish to suppose that this nation - or, indeed, any other nation on this earth - should ever expect meaningful progress at the intentional expense of other nations. The bottom line? Disease pandemics are potentially universal or near-universal and could provide impetus not only for mitigating a particular pathology and pandemic but also for institutionalizing far wider patterns of more durable global <a style="cursor: help" title="Says Emmerich de Vattel, in The Law of Nations (1758), 'The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement of other Nations.'">cooperation</a>.

By its very nature, the US president's core mantra of celebrating perpetually belligerent nationalism is crude and injurious. Now, instead of "America First," the only sensible posture for any president must be some coherent variation of “all the world together." Such an improved mantra might not be all that difficult to operationalize if only there were antecedent political <em><a style="cursor: help" title="In modern philosophy, the evident highlighting of this useful term lies in Arthur Schopenhauer's writings, especially The World as Will and Idea (1818). For his own inspiration (and by his own expressed acknowledgment), Schopenhauer drew freely upon Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Later, Nietzsche drew just as freely (and perhaps more importantly) upon Schopenhauer. Goethe also served as a core intellectual source for Spanish existentialist Jose Ortega y' Gasset, author of the prophetic work, The Revolt of the Masses (Le Rebelion de las Masas (1930). See, accordingly, Ortega's very grand essay, 'In Search of Goethe from Within' (1932), written for Die Neue Rundschau of Berlin on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's death. It is reprinted in Ortega's anthology, The Dehumanization of Art (1948) and is available from Princeton University Press (1968).">will</a></em>. Nor would it necessarily be bewilderingly complex. In fact, the basic idea is discoverable in the prescient words of Pierre Teilhard De Chardin: "The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of everyone for himself,” summarized the Jesuit scientist and philosopher, “is false and against nature. No element can move and grow except with and by all the others with itself."

<em>Prima facie</em>, the key message here is simple, straightforward and thoroughly illogical to contest. This message communicates, among other things, that no single country's individual success can be achieved at the planned expense of other countries. Moreover, we should learn from the same message, no individual national success is reasonably sustainable if the world as a whole must thereby expect a correspondingly diminishing future.

No conceivably gainful configuration of Planet Earth can prove rewarding if the vast but segmented human legions which comprise it are set morally, spiritually, and intellectually adrift. It is, of course, precisely such a willful detachment from secure national and international moorings that is being fostered by Donald Trump’s "<a style="cursor: help" title="Significantly, international law is part of United States jurisprudence. In the words of Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the judgment of the US Supreme Court in Paquete Habana (1900): 'International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction....' (175 U.S. 677(1900)) See also: Opinion in Tel-Oren vs. Libyan Arab Republic (726 F. 2d 774 (1984)). Moreover, the specific incorporation of treaty law into US municipal law is expressly codified at Art. 6 of the US Constitution, the so-called 'Supremacy Clause.'">America First</a>."

Earlier, observed William Butler Yeats, in what had already represented a broadly metaphorical indictment of what could be expected, “The blood-dimmed tide is <a style="cursor: help" title="Nonetheless, whether described in the Old Testament or in other sources of ancient Western thought, chaos can also be a source of human betterment. In essence, chaos is that which prepares the world for all things, both sacred and profane. Further, as its conspicuous etymology reveals, chaos represents the yawning gulf or gap wherein nothing is as yet, but also where all civilizational opportunity must inevitably originate. Appropriately, the great German poet Hölderlin observed: 'There is a desert sacred and chaotic which stands at the roots of the things and which prepares all things.' Even in the pagan ancient world, the Greeks thought of such a desert as logos, which indicates to us that it was presumed to be anything but starkly random or without conceivable merit.">loosed</a>." But just as it was then for the empathetic Irish poet, today’s expanding global chaos is still primarily a symptom. It is, therefore, as the professional philosophers would likely prefer to label, “merely epiphenomenal."

In every important sense, the philosophers would be correct. For the world as a whole, chaos and anarchy are never the genuinely underlying "disease." Always, that more determinative pathology remains rooted in certain ostentatiously great and powerful states that stubbornly fail to recognize the vital imperatives of human interrelatedness. This core incapacity to acknowledge our species’ indestructible biological “oneness” (utterly obvious with today's Covid-19 pandemic) has been a long-term problem. It is not in any way particular to certain American presidents or even to the US in its entirety.

Now, in the literal midst of a worldwide pathological assault from the coronavirus, what should we expect from President Trump's still-unhidden contempt for cooperative world community? Most plausibly, world politics will increasingly encourage or enlarge an already basic human deficit. This shortfall is the incapacity of individual citizens and their respective state societies to discover authentic self-worth as individual persons; that is, deeply, <em>within themselves</em>. Such an enduring deficit was foreseen in the eighteenth century by America's then-leading person of letters, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Today, revealingly, the still-vital insights of "American Transcendentalism" remain recognizable only to an excruciatingly tiny minority of citizens.

And this presumptively in an “educated society?”

Notwithstanding its impressive intellectual antecedents, including some earlier occupants of the White House, the US population almost never reads serious books. This cryptic observation is not offered here in any offhanded or gratuitously mean-spirited fashion, but, quite the contrary, as a lamentable fact of American life, one famously commented upon during the first third of the nineteenth century by a distinguished French visitor to the new republic, Alexis de Tocqueville (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/815/815-h/815-h.htm">Democracy in America</a>). This same fact led the Founding Fathers to rail against any uneducated mass participation in the new nation’s formal governance.

From our species’ earliest ventures into global politics, intersectional behavior has been driven by some kind or other of specific group elevation and by resultant inter-group conflicts.

From the calculable origins of human civilizations, most people have felt themselves lost or abandoned outside the collectively encompassing warmth of a protective tribe. Since the seventeenth century and the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the recurrent conflicts between such "sovereign" tribes has been the principal scourge of competitive nationalism.

Significantly, from pandemic control to nuclear war avoidance, this belligerent nationalism has been sorely misconceived, but never more so that in today's Trump-based US foreign policy. Left to fester on its own intrinsic demerits, this atavistic American mantra will harden the hearts of this country's most recalcitrant enemies. What we need now, desperately, is a visible broadening of support for the enduring impulses of global solidarity and human interconnectedness.

From the Peace of Westphalia, which ended the last of the religious wars sparked by the Reformation, international relations and <a style="cursor: help" title="For the authoritative sources of international law, see art. 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice: STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, Done at San Francisco, June 26, 1945. Entered into force, Oct. 24, 1945; for the United States, Oct. 24, 1945. 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993, 3 Bevans 1153, 1976 Y.B.U.N., 1052.">international law</a> have been shaped by an ever-changing but always unstable "<a style="cursor: help" title="International law remains a 'vigilante' or 'Westphalian' system of jurisprudence. The Peace of Westphalia created the still-existing decentralized or self-help state system. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1, Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.">balance of power</a>." Hope still exists, more-or-less, but now it must sing softly, in an embarrassed undertone, with marked circumspection, and <em>sotto voce</em>. Although counter-intuitive, the time for any visceral celebrations of nationalism, military technology, and even social media is at least partially over. In order to merely survive on an imperiled planet, all of us, <em>together</em>, must first seek to rediscover an <em>individual life</em>, one that is wittingly detached from all pre-patterned kinds of nationalistic conformance and from all contrived visages of some foolishly imagined tribal happiness.

Then we might finally learn that the most suffocating insecurities of life on earth can never be undone by militarizing global economics, by building larger missiles, by abrogating international treaties or by advancing so-called ”realistic” definitions of national security.

In the end, truth is exculpatory. Surprisingly, in a uniquely promising paradox, Trump’s America First policies’ express a continuous lie that can still help us see the truth. This particular truth, cosmopolitan in outlook, is that Americans must become abundantly conscious of unity and relatedness between <em>all</em> human beings and between <em>all</em> nation-states.

Again, the common enemy of a worldwide disease pandemic could become an appropriate beginning for just such a new global consciousness.

Could the needed transition from “realist” world politics to more genuinely collaborative international interactions actually take place? The pertinent odds are seemingly low. The current situation of worldwide pandemic as <em>opportunity</em> is <em>sui generis</em> and difficult to accept. Yet, it rightfully brings to mind the wise and reinforcing observation of Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini: “The visionary is the only realist.”

In all that has been discussed and assessed above, irony abounds. But ironic observations need not in any way be disqualifying. Though it would seem inconceivable that any serious human benefits could be extracted from a virulent and unpredictable pandemic, there still remain certain latent opportunities for planetary gain in a commonly loathed disease adversary.

Because we could hardly seek to discover such a convenient foe in extra-planetary aggressions, national governments throughout the world should identify extended cooperation against the coronavirus as a propitious first-step toward wider forms of global collaboration. Here, in what political scientists and other scholars used to call “functionalism” or “structural-functionalism,” there could take place a dignifying “spillover” of cooperative world politics from one very specific and ubiquitous health problem to far more generalized affirmations of human “<a style="cursor: help" title="At this time, for example, Israelis and Palestinians are cooperating closely in the common battle against Covid-19.">oneness</a>.”

In the final analysis, such well-founded affirmations will prove indispensable to species survival. A corollary question of Karl Jaspers now presents itself: <em>Is it an end that now draws near, or a beginning?</em> The answer will depend entirely upon our willingness to see ourselves as fully coexisting voyageurs on a perpetually single and interdependent planet.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everybody knows that the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/special-coverage-of-covid-19/">Coronavirus</a> pandemic is an economic catastrophe. Small businesses are already failing and people are losing their jobs. The government can and should do everything possible to mitigate their suffering. But in at least one economic sector, there is another option.

The arts sector is struggling for the same reason many other sectors are struggling. Its lifeblood is ticket sales, and all public events are canceled. Many small arts organizations have already folded, and many more are on the verge of bankruptcy.

But the arts sector is also unique because it consists primarily of charitable organizations. And some of those charities have vast amounts of money. They just aren’t spending it. Now is the time.

The overwhelming majority of charitable organizations in the United States are grassroots public charities, small organizations with small budgets, run by a small number of people. But the overwhelming majority of charitable assets belong to private foundations, organizations created by wealthy people to support charitable causes.

Essentially, a private foundation is a pot of money that exists for the purpose of funding public charities. Federal law <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/4942">requires</a> private foundations to distribute 5 percent of their assets every year, on pain of heavy fines. Ideally, those distributions are grants to public charities, although some disreputable foundations spend heavily on “administrative expenses,” including salaries.

In practice, the 5 percent distribution requirement enables private foundations to distribute only their investment income. Investment income tends to exceed 5 percent, especially if you have a lot of money to invest. As a consequence, private foundations can exist in perpetuity, and even increase their endowment over time.

But 5 percent of assets is only the minimum distribution. Nothing prevents foundations from distributing more. Indeed, some private foundations intentionally distribute more than 5 percent, in order to spend themselves out of existence.

In this moment of crisis, arts foundations should immediately increase their financial support of the organizations they fund. Indeed, I believe the trustees of those foundations have an obligation to increase funding and save organizations that are on the brink.

One of the fiduciary duties of a trustee of a charitable organization is the duty of obedience, or the duty to make decisions in light of the charitable purpose of the organization. The only charitable purpose of an arts foundation is to fund arts organizations. When arts organizations are struggling to survive, arts foundations have a duty to keep them afloat. They have the money, and now is the time to use it.

Some arts foundations have already started to recognize this obligation. For example, the <a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/1436666/516-arts-to-distribute-60k-in-relief-grants.html">Warhol Foundation</a> has eliminated restrictions on the use of grant funds. While that is a start, it isn’t nearly enough.

I think every arts foundation should immediately double every grant it made for 2020. If an organization was worth funding, it’s worth saving. Yes, it will cut into the endowments of arts foundations. But that is precisely the reason they exist in the first place, to ensure that rainy day funds are there when they are needed.

If arts foundations don’t step up to the plate now, it will call the justification for their existence into question. They have no value or purpose other than funding the arts. Now is the time. “Hic Rhodus, hic saltus.”

		<title>Power and Fear: Strongmen and &quot;The Virus”</title>
		<link>https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/03/david-crane-covid-19/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[These are difficult times. The world is unraveling around the edges. Societies are reeling under the threat of “The Virus”. Fear is spreading faster than the virus itself. People are looking to survive. Survival instincts are or could start to set in. Citizens are also looking for decisive and strong leadership by those in power around the world.

This is a moment where national security becomes paramount.  Nations are looking to solutions, some based on law and in other ways—perhaps. In our age of the strongman, under the guise of nationalism with a dose of populism, this mixture of fear and preserving/securing the nation from the virus, advisers to these various strongmen across the globe see an opportunity to seize further power or at least maintain power.

Dictators, strongmen, and various tyrants who are in power understand deviously the implications of “power”. It keeps them in office and it is worth its weight in political gold. They also understand “fear." A populace that is afraid is easier govern. They look to the the strongman for guidance. Confronted with an external threat they will rally around the guidance of the head of state.

One tried and true technique by strongmen is using that power, coupled with fear, and focus it on an internal or external threat. I call this the “boogeyman”. Strongmen select a boogeyman to shift the populace’s unease on a perceived or actual threat, allowing that populace to focus their fear and frustrations on that threat. While their citizens are venting their frustrations and fear on the boogeyman, the strongman uses it to rally the nation against it, and seek further power to defeat the threat. The strongman knows all to well how this works—give me the power to deal with the boogeyman knocking at our door. I can save you and our nation if you let me, the strongman will say.  History shows us this works and works well.

So in this time of “The Virus”, strongmen have their moment using power, fear, and a boogeyman to not only survive, but thrive.  From the perspective of the strongman, this is almost too good to be true. The boogeyman is easy to identify—its “The Virus”. The fear is real and spreading. The move towards greater power all in the name of national security is already happening.  In large measure, in a liberal democracy the law does give a head of state, executive, or a commander in chief authorities to protect the nation. This is as it should be. Through this period of the pandemic we are seeing governments declare this power and handing that amazing power to an Executive to protect the nation and save the lives of its citizens.  All this is legal and appropriate.

Yet, we see in this age of the strongmen, subtle signs that various heads of state using the pandemic for their political gain.  A perfect example of this is watching the Prime Minister of Israel, an ersatz strongman, hide behind the the pandemic to remain in power to “save the nation”, using it as a shield from his political weakness and criminal indictment.  This is troublesome and bears watching. Certainly other strongman are watching and considering the possibilities.

In the United States we have a President who is an unabashed admirer of strongmen.  He would love to have the ability to consolidate power and be the sole authority over American citizens.  His advisers see the extensive powers he has and is being granted by our laws to face the pandemic as an avenue to take further power onto himself.  We are just a step away, perhaps within days, of this President in the name of national security, legally seizing our manufacturing system, distribution system, our medical infrastructure, using it to leverage practical and political advantage against and for desperate State governors.  Taking this a possible step further, again in the name of “saving the nation”, this President suspending the Constitution, abolishing free speech, political parties, and of course the 2020 election.  The ultimate power grab. Fantasy, fiction, a bad dream? Will a fearful and cowed nation allow this to happen?

With a different President it would be fantasy, but for this strongman-wannabe, the current President, it is not.  We are not there yet, but we need to be very wary of the possibilities.  A President who only governs for his own personal gain and vanity, can couple the boogeyman that is “The Virus” with that fear of that virus and make a move to consolidate his power over the short, medium, and long term. Beware.

Let’s heed the words of Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, Robert H. Jackson, in an article in 1953: <em>There is no such thing as an achieved liberty; like electricity, there can be no substantial storage and it must be generated as it is enjoyed, or the lights go out.</em>

&nbsp;

<em>David Crane is founding Chief Prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal in West Africa called the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  He is also a retired member of the Senior Executive Service of the United States and founder of the Global Accountability Initiative.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine you are in your third year of law school. The finish line of graduation is ahead of you and the most important test of your entire life looms on the horizon. You have gone through your law school classes for the last three years knowing that you will have to study for two to three months, take a two-day exam, and then wait until mid-fall before you can begin practicing law. Now imagine that a pandemic has made taking the bar exam unsafe and states have <a href="https://www.nybarexam.org/Press/PressRelease_NY_BarExam.pdf">started to cancel</a> the July 2020 bar exam. This is the reality that I and the rest of the graduating class of 2020 are living in as our third year is coming to a close with uncertainty on the horizon.

On March 27, 2020, the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-covid-19-updates/?utm_source=hootsuite&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=COVID3.23JulyBar">announced</a> that it will decide whether to deploy materials for the July bar exam on or around May 5, 2020. The NCBE also opened up the possibility for jurisdictions to administer the bar exam in the fall. This indecisiveness has left many members of the class of 2020 confused and stressed about what will happen to their employment offers if the bar exam is not administered on schedule. Most third-year students at this point have paid for their bar prep materials and have submitted their bar applications. The delay in a decision is causing undue stress and uncertainty in a time where it is needed most.

Delaying the bar exam until fall may also prove to be unsuccessful because researchers are expecting a second wave of COVID-19 to emerge in the fall. The National Institute of Health is working on clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine, but there is no telling when it will be ready for public distribution. It is unlikely that the NCBE will allow the bar exam to proceed as planned this summer because of the pandemic and no way to ensure it can safely be administered. However, the state of the world is unlikely to change between July and October. So, where does that leave the class of 2020? It would be impractical of the NCBE to expect students to wait until February 2021 to take the bar exam. Such a large delay would lessen the number of lawyers going into the workforce and would impact employment offers already extended to members of the class.

So, what other option does the NCBE have if it chooses to cancel the bar exam in July but also cannot reschedule it in the fall? A <a href="https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/292/63885/COVID19-and-the-July-2020-Bar-Exam.03.22.201-copy.pdf">working paper</a> from scholars at Ohio State University Moritz College of Law has attempted to provide an answer. The paper advocates for jurisdictions to consider six possible alternatives to the administration of the July 2020 bar exam. An option that has gained favor among the class of 2020 and others is enacting <a href="https://www.law.com/2020/03/26/no-bar-exam-thats-what-1000-law-students-want-ny-to-declare-amid-covid-19/">emergency diploma privilege</a>. Diploma privilege would allow graduates of ABA-accredited schools to obtain a bar license without having to take the bar exam. <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/scr/40/03">Wisconsin</a> is the only state in the US that currently has this rule. In Wisconsin, students who graduate from one of the two ABA-accredited Wisconsin law schools are eligible to join the Wisconsin State Bar Association. If enacted, diploma privilege should allow recent graduates who were going to sit for the July 2020 bar exam to practice in the state where they graduated from law school.

In 2009, almost 14,700 members of the State Bar of Wisconsin were admitted though diploma privilege. Erica Moeser, director of the Madison-based NCBE, has <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/state-s-longtime-diploma-privilege-challenged/article_e45f22e3-7cb0-5c2e-8b92-8b81bbdd8061.html">advocated</a> for Wisconsin to institute a bar exam because it prevents bad lawyers from “slipping through the system.” The use of diploma privilege has declined and it does not have the support of the American Bar Association. But does it have to be that way? There are so many academic journals and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeleef/2015/04/22/true-or-false-we-need-the-bar-exam-to-ensure-lawyer-competence/#12a08e99631f">studies</a> that show that the bar exam does not ensure that a person who passes the bar exam will be a competent lawyer. The bar exam tests how well a person can memorize a large amount of material in two to three months and regurgitate it all over the span of two days through answering essays and multiple-choice questions. In other words, the bar exam tells administrators which prospective lawyers are really good at taking tests, which are just okay, and those who are really bad at them. Some prominent leaders have failed the bar exam on the first try. Not because they were not smart enough, but because rapid memorization and regurgitation are not how some people learn. Diploma privilege will ensure that law schools are teaching information that will actually be helpful to students going into practice rather than pressuring students to take subjects that will be useful for the bar exam. Law schools may be more inclined to encourage students in their last year to take practicums and clinics that teach hands-on skills rather than encouraging them to take classes that will improve their chances of passing the bar.

I admit diploma privilege is not a perfect solution. There are likely prospective lawyers who have been able to get through law school without putting in hard work because they are good at school and taking tests. Admittedly, the abolishment of a bar exam may radically shape the legal landscape and how law schools recruit students. However, none of that should deter the NCBE from considering urging jurisdictions to consider adopting either temporary or permanent diploma privilege for people who were hoping to take the July 2020 bar exam. This change would give prospective lawyers security in the jobs they have accepted and would allow the class of 2020 to enter the job market in a time where lawyers will be needed to help deal with the legal issues that will come out of the pandemic. Recommending the cancellation of the July 2020 bar exam because August, September, or October may be a safer time is akin to the NCBE telling prospective lawyers that their livelihoods and need for security in this time do not matter. Regardless of whether the NCBE decides to cancel the July 2020 bar exam or recommend jurisdictions use diploma privilege, it should not wait until May 5.

I am not angry at the NCBE for creating unnecessary uncertainty. I am just disappointed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The world in a plague year is a world turned upside down. Everything familiar becomes strange, and everything normal becomes peculiar. Commodities become scarce and luxuries become worthless. Leisure becomes insufferable and labor becomes precious. The great become small and the small reveal their greatness.

But one thing is constant. The plagiarism police remain vigilant. Neither plague nor pestilence nor quarantine nor social distancing stays these soldiers from pursuing their self-appointed mission. If they cannot abide a plagiarist during normal times, they cannot abide a plagiarist during plaguetime either. Indeed, they must increase their vigilance, as none other will stand athwart copying and yell stop.

Why should we humor these curmudgeonly guardians of scholarly propriety? Oh, they would be delighted to explain it to you, in insufferable but trivially novel or well-attributed detail. We must protect readers from unscrupulous authors, who wish merely to entertain, rather than honor their predecessors. We must protect authors from scurrilous copyists, who wish only to siphon their fame. And we must protect copyright owners, who wish solely to pretend that anything is really new.

As would any cop, the plagiarism police target the weakest offenders, who have the least to lose. In their case, it is students, who observe plagiarism rules with the same diligence and respect they accord alcohol prohibition. And who can blame them? After all, nothing undercuts the legitimacy of a rule like hypocrisy. If anything, plagiarism rules are even more hypocritical.

We academics tell our students they must attribute every idea and expression they wish to use. But we all know perfectly well there is nothing new under the sun. All of human thought is a footnote. Even Plato was surely a copyist, we have merely forgotten his sources. Our students snicker, even as they genuflect. They know our garments are imaginary.

Why do we object to students copying? We insist they cannot learn without producing ideas and expressions <em>sui generis</em>, like spinning chaff into gold. But we never expect the same of ourselves, and for good reason. It is wasteful to reinvent the wheel, and we value our time, even if we don’t value theirs. We recycle because it is efficient and sensible, but pretend irrelevant citations make it hagiography. Spare me. Nobody cares about the footnotes, except the people they exalt.

We are scholars. But we are also teachers. And our only job as teachers - the only purpose of universities as schools - is educating students. Anything that helps students learn is good. Anything that keeps students from learning is bad. There is considerable evidence that copying promotes learning, and plagiarism norms prevent it. If you care about learning, you should embrace plagiarism, at least when it comes to students. In this case, we truly must destroy the norm in order to save it.

Students copy in order to practice writing skills, internalize an unfamiliar voice, or articulate ideas they cannot yet refine. We should encourage all of these practices because they are what is called “learning.” Plagiarism norms teach students only that certain professors in certain disciplines enforce incoherent and unpredictable rules with uncompromising severity. After all, in many disciplines, copying is not only tolerated but positively encouraged. In the arts as well as in lawyering, if you aren’t plagiarizing, you’re committing malpractice.

Perhaps in plaguetime we can reconsider even the rules of our little cartel. As academics, we love plagiarism rules. They are the only thing that allows us to own the idea we covet and cling to so preciously. But our desires are a small thing, and petty to boot. If we wish to continue persecuting each other, at least let us spare our students.

I encourage you to turn a blind eye to so-called plagiarism, so long as students are learning. To hell with plagiarism policies and honor councils. To hell with plagiarism detectors and pledges. Let students learn however it makes sense to them. If it means copying, so be it. They’ll do plenty when they start practicing law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“The world is contending with the increasing incidence and severity of a wide range of highly infectious diseases.” These words appear in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3299483">Responsibility for Epidemics</a>, an article I wrote in 2018. There have of course been dire warnings about a global pandemic for a while. In Responsibility for Epidemics, I argue that a broader conceptualization of responsibility is necessary to effectively deal with highly infectious diseases given their potential to become worldwide pandemics. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the latest to expose how the increasing interconnectedness of the world will make epidemic diseases progressively more difficult to contain. Highly infectious diseases like COVID-19 typically do not respect borders or passports. They do not distinguish between nationality, race, ethnicity, gender or other categories. They pose transnational challenges that require cooperation and action through law.

States at times turn to international law to confront problems that overwhelm and transcend boundaries. International law increasingly addresses every type of human activity, including those typically considered the exclusive domestic jurisdiction of states—like public health and the prevention, containment, mitigation and treatment of epidemic diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes why it is necessary to question the extant frameworks for responsibility for epidemic and pandemic diseases. Key considerations include how responsibility should be distributed amongst actors and which actors should be held responsible. A thorough analysis of the actors responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic would require that we be substantially on the other side of the curve. Accordingly, this post focuses on the issues implicated in trying to address the former. This post also begins to consider what responsibility should look like for epidemic and pandemic diseases. Another <a href="https://www.afronomicslaw.org/2020/05/12/africa-covid-19-and-responsibility/">post</a> will delve deeper into re-conceptualizing responsibility.

The legal framework for controlling highly infectious diseases is spread across multiple regimes internationally. The regime for allocating responsibility is located under the <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf">law of responsibility</a>, which provides that states that violate international law have “an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrong act.” Global public health law is the most specific field regulating infectious diseases and it sets out the primary obligations of states in the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246107/9789241580496-eng.pdf?sequence=1">International Health Regulations</a> (2005). Its main purpose is to “prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease.” The Regulations create a system of state surveillance and notification for certain infectious diseases. Another important framework is human rights law, which includes <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">protections</a> against the arbitrary deprivation of life and the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">right</a> of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Under human rights law, states are to take primary responsibility to prevent, treat, and control epidemic diseases.

The most common answer to how responsibility is allocated following epidemic or pandemic diseases is that no actor is held responsible and no allocation occurs. For example, states have generally not pursued legal action against other countries with claims of <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/69394/covid-19-and-international-law-must-china-compensate-countries-for-the-damage-international-health-regulations/">failure to comply</a> with disease notification obligations. Additionally, state actors tend to regard their human rights obligations as territorial, even though member states to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights are <a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL">supposed</a> to respect the enjoyment of the right to health in other countries. State parties are also obligated to prevent third parties from violating the right to health in other countries if they are able to influence third parties by way of legal or political means that do not conflict with other international obligations. Moreover, state parties must provide an environment that facilitates the discharge of responsibilities on the right to health. Yet, this often does not pertain.

Under the law of responsibility, every internationally wrongful act of a state comes with international responsibility. An internationally wrongful act of a state could be an action or omission. The first requirement is that the conduct in question be attributable to the state under international law. The second requirement for responsibility to attach to a state is that the conduct must constitute a breach of a primary international legal obligation of that state. The International Law Commission’s <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf">commentary</a> states that no specific mental state is required with respect to the breach of a state’s primary obligation, “only the act of a state that matters, independently of any intention.” It goes on to provide that the mental standard should depend on the circumstances and does not set out a presumption one way or another.

Similarly, the mental state requirement for analyzing responsibility for epidemics and pandemics should also be wide-ranging. Responsibility should not be limited to solely situations where it is the actor’s purpose or conscious objective to perform an action that causes or exacerbates the harmful effects of highly infectious diseases. The commentary similarly recognizes that no fault or intention to harm is required for attribution of state responsibility. A fulsome responsibility analysis then should also not simply contemplate situations where an actor has knowledge that their conduct will cause a harmful result, but the actor is indifferent to that result. The commentary acknowledges that in some instances whether there has been a breach of an international obligation may depend on the intention or knowledge of relevant state organs or agents, but does not require the mental state of knowledge as a general rule. An in-depth analysis of responsibility should also include reckless actors that are aware of the strong possibility that their behavior will produce harm but discount the risks and continues anyway. A thorough responsibility analysis must also account for situations of gross negligence where the actor is unaware and inadvertently creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm and this failure constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable actor in the same situation would exercise. A responsibility for epidemics analysis that recognizes a heightened standard of negligence would be beneficial because it would require the most egregious inadvertent actors to internalize the detrimental effects of the external costs they impose. A rigorous analysis should also expand to include negligent actors who are inadvertent and fail to exercise the standard of care that a reasonable actor would exercise in like circumstances. Allowing for regular negligence as a mental standard would incentivize actors to perform the <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/part-i-due-diligence-and-covid-19-states-duties-to-prevent-and-halt-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">due diligence</a> required in instances of highly infectious diseases. This broad approach to analyzing responsibility for epidemic or pandemic diseases would be better overall for society because it would incentivize more careful policies and actions. A comprehensive approach, which allows for the application of different mental states depending on the circumstances is compatible with extant principles of responsibility. It will also be sufficiently robust to capture the harms that result from direct and indirect action that are seen during pandemic and epidemic diseases.

Under the principles of responsibility, there must be a causal link between the internationally wrongful act and the injury. The International Law Commission has made clear in the commentary that responsibility is only warranted where the injury resulted from and is ascribable to the wrongful act as opposed to all consequences flowing from an internationally wrongful act. Few cases of pandemic or epidemic diseases are characterized by clear lines of causation. A narrow reading of causation would stop at the following inquiry: if the actor refrained from action, would the result have occurred anyway? However, causation so narrowly understood cannot offer the primary basis for conceptualizing responsibility. In the traditional but-for test, the focus is on whether the result would have occurred but for the actor's actions. Yet, this would elide the realities of highly infectious diseases, which are characterized by overdetermination. Instead, an inquiry aimed at allocating responsibility should consider: (1) whether the actor's actions were a substantial factor in producing the result, regardless of whether the outcome might have occurred anyway; (2) whether the actor's actions hastened the result; or (3) whether the actor's actions make survival less likely as a result. These queries are important because without examining them one would tend to stop at the first-level inquiry. However, it is critical to delve deeper. Failure to ask the right queries may lead to inaccuracies in identifying what actors are responsible. Thus, the inquiry should focus on whether a given set of actions and omissions were at least substantial factors in producing or contributing to serious adverse consequences witnessed during an epidemic or pandemic.

The commentary to the principles of responsibility also recognizes that causality, in fact, is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Thus, when determining responsibility internationally, causation usually will not be established where the result is so remote that it would be illegitimate to hold a specific actor accountable. The requirement of a clear causal chain that is foreseeable or proximate to hold an actor responsible for an injury is a fundamental principle recognized in the law of responsibility. A thorough causation analysis should thus consider the direct actions or omissions—be they domestic, international or internal with extraterritorial effect—that had reasonably foreseeable consequences—that resulted in exacerbating an epidemic or pandemic disease. The International Law Commission explained in its commentary that the allocation of responsibility for a wrongful act is legal and not only an analysis of historical or causal processes. Yet, a thorough accounting must necessarily lengthen the causal gaze temporally to fully account for the status quo vulnerabilities of health systems to highly infectious diseases.

A fulsome responsibility analysis would assign contemporary obligations not solely based on immediately preceding events, but also consider historic action that has undermined health systems and contributed to or facilitated the spread of epidemic and pandemic diseases. Broadening the timeline would necessitate consideration of whether the harmful effects of past actions are traceable to the outcomes and trajectories of epidemics and pandemics. This expanded approach to causation does not require trying to disprove all counterfactuals given the impossibility of knowing what would occur in an alternative universe with other circumstances. There is also the ethical reality that makes conducting a social experiment to determine such results impossible. What is most important is the determination of whether the actions or inactions are not too remote or accidental to have a just bearing on the determination of responsibility.

There are many challenges with applying the extant law of responsibility in instances of pandemic and epidemic diseases. First, the law of responsibility is too state-centric in terms of both account holders and power wielders and leaves important nonstate actors outside the circle of responsibility. The traditional principles of responsibility perpetuate the fallacy that states can cope with structural problems, including the increased incidence of epidemic and pandemic diseases. States are not self-sufficient. The deleterious effects of highly infectious diseases are informed in part by the actions or inactions of global institutions like international organizations, important transnational actors like pharmaceutical companies, public-private partnerships and other significant nonstate actors, as well as epidemiological factors, that may be well beyond the control of a given state. Emerging areas of the law of responsibility attempt to recognize concerted action resulting in internationally wrongful acts where there is shared responsibility between international organizations and states, or between international organizations. This attempt to develop the law only pertains to concerted action. The failure to provide for cumulative but nonconcerted action by multiple actors potentially allows states and nonstate actors, to engage in blame avoidance and blame shifting for their actions and inactions that result in exacerbating the consequences of highly infectious diseases. The law of responsibility, like other areas of law, is not neutral, as even non-attribution is a method of distributing responsibility.

When dealing with indivisible harms caused by epidemics and pandemics, there are inevitable challenges in attributing responsibility under traditional principles. Namely, it is difficult to determine what specific actor caused the exact action that later produced a definitive aspect of the damage witnessed. The International Law Commission clarified that it is up to the responsible state to demonstrate what proportion is not attributable to its conduct. The law of responsibility is inapt for addressing epidemic or pandemic disease because the individual actions of multiple actors may be distributed in a way that does not meet these legal requirements. The commentary recognizes that there are some instances where an identifiable element of injury can properly be allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone. Yet, it is generally not possible to bring a claim against the collective for cumulative injury. As explained in the commentary on the principles of responsibility, unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible state, then it is fair to hold an actor responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct. Thus, one could hold states jointly and severally responsible for the resulting harm irrespective of their own contributions. Theoretically, a state actor could be held responsible for the harm irrespective of the size of their individual contribution. Yet, the law on the books for responsibility is untenable for the realities of today’s world wherein responsibility likely needs to be distributed to several states and nonstate actors.

Formal determinations of responsibility for epidemic or pandemic diseases will also be difficult to come by not just because of the lack of political appetite to pursue outbreaks that are perceived as purely biological or natural occurrences. There are also many procedural and practical limitations. For example, all international dispute settlement mechanisms are premised on state consent. Claims with allegations of harms during an epidemic or pandemic disease would not be able to proceed against a state if it withholds its consent to jurisdiction internationally. A recent class-action lawsuit brought in a US federal court seeks damages for the COVID-19 pandemic against China. Yet, finding a domestic court that has and decides to exercise jurisdiction given sovereign immunity and other jurisprudential doctrines over the actors implicated in pandemics and epidemics will be challenging. Additionally, there could be numerous joinders of parties and counterclaims that would likely make litigation cumbersome. You could envision arguments put forward by accused governments that they acted in time to put other governments on notice regarding a highly infectious disease and those actors failed to exercise the due diligence required and to take necessary measures to prevent further harm. Further, even in situations where claimants are successful, they may face difficulty recovering from respondents. For example, when seeking damages for arbitrary deprivation of life or violations of the right to health during pandemics or epidemic diseases as some actors would likely be judgment proof given the potential amounts involved. This post demonstrates that reimagination of responsibility is required more generally and especially as applied to epidemic and pandemic diseases. It also indicates that more substantial international legal and institutional reform is necessary to provide full redress for violations witnessed with epidemic and pandemic diseases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the moment, there are over <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html">70.8 million people forcibly displaced</a> from their homes. The fast mobility of large populations is an inalienable part of humanity that is driven by drought, famine, earthquake, climate change, political opinion, massive violation of human rights, religious persecution, racial discrimination, ideological conflict, war, and pandemic diseases. People fleeing such a catena of crisis are called refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and stateless persons and they are recognized under international law. I refer to these classes of people with the abbreviation ‘RAMS’ to signify their collective plight of flight or transit. Measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 have been casting a significant impact on RAMS in the form of border closures, travel restrictions, and racial discrimination in refugee camps and against RAMS on move. Currently, around 20 percent of the global populations have been put under lockdown due to coronavirus. While the global COVID-19 pandemic unquestionably necessitates exceptional actions, many national governments have been executing their pre-pandemic policies of restrictionism and securitization driven by growing far-right nationalism and rabid populism across the world including India. The entry into Hungary’s transit zone, which has been suspended, amounts to deprivation of the <a href="http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/mmt/udhr/article_14.html">right to asylum</a> in the name of "risk related to the spread of COVID-19" in Hungary. Thousands of refugees and migrants confront detention in Bosnia in the newly built Lipa refugee camps close to the border of Croatia. The government has legitimized such measures as an act of "urgent measure[s] to prevent the onset of the disease caused by COVID-19," sparking fears over social distancing and access to water, electricity, and medicine in the refugee camps.

Similarly, South Africa revealed the construction of 40 kilometers of emergency border barriers along the international boundary of Zimbabwe to guarantee that ‘no undocumented or infected person crosses into the country’ which has been among the last countries to be infected by the global pandemic. There are some crucial challenges for both refugees and migrants in the states of reception that include access to healthcare, water, energy, and other basic needs in the wake of coronavirus due to the policies of restriction and securitization. The decision of the government of Portugal to grant <span><a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/29/coronavirus-portugal-grants-temporary-citizenship-rights-to-migrants">provisional citizenship rights</a> to all refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants with pending applications for residency certificates to facilitate their access to healthcare is one of the most exceptional and pragmatic initiatives for human dignity for all. In the context of these crushingly adverse policy developments, the novel coronavirus will excessively impact and engulf the entire community of refugees and migrants as it spreads like wildfire</span> in their camps and camp-like-facilities due to their jam-packed population. Further, there are apprehensions regarding access to healthcare services, strengthening the healthcare infrastructures, successful dissemination of information about the COVID-19 disease in the refugee camps. Therefore, it is challenging to follow social distancing and lockdown in refugee camps as these camps have become <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2020/sgsm20021.doc.htm">ultra-vulnerable populations</a>, and social distancing has come to be regarded as a privilege of socio-economically influential people, particularly in the developing countries.

Indeed, the volume of the measures carried out as of now, along with future actions and the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic <em>per se,</em> shall have all-embracing and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/five-ways-covid-19-changing-global-migration">sweeping corollaries</a> for refugee camps and RAMS. So far, there is a visible gap when it comes to unimpeachable evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on refugee camps and refugees and migrants moving outside the refugee camps. Refugees in the camps are not able to have access to relevant information on COVID-19 and answers to questions such as: how does this global pandemic create an extraordinarily hostile environment for them? How does available information to refugees in camps influence their decision-making about their migration, aims and ambitions during their migratory movements? Is Social Distancing the privilege and luxury of the citizens alone that refugees and migrants cannot afford, as evidenced by the COVID-19 lockdown worldwide? Are there lessons to be reflected by the national governments and citizens at large from the current pandemic crisis? Are there affordable alternatives for the refugees in camps and vulnerable migrants in the host states outside economic disparity? Can the global community of nation-states be ready to execute the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/new-york-declaration-for-refugees-and-migrants.html">Global Compact on Refugees</a> framework and stop its recurrences for once and all? Does it change the conditions under which refugees and migrants move, confront border closures, and strive hard to access their protection, healthcare and assistance in the destination countries?

Thus, the ground reality of distressed human mobility of RAMS and other forms of migrants during the coronavirus pandemic testify to the stark reality that only an elite fragment of the global demographic whole has sustainable resources, including in India. But poor and marginalized sections of the population who strive to eke out daily livelihood cannot afford to subscribe to Social Distancing Measures (SDMs). For example, in an open crowded camp in central Greece, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1060972&quot;">23 migrants tested positive for COVID-19</a> as reported by the IOM. The refugee camps in the Global North, particularly in <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/asylum-seekers-left-in-inhumane-conditions-in-german-refugee-center/a-48592696">Germany</a> and in the Global South, especially in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31395-9/fulltext">Cox Bazar Refugee Camp</a> in Bangladesh, have added salt to injury as these camps are already confronting many skin and respiratory diseases, which might convert into coronavirus infections. At the same time, the COVID-19 crisis, also an unprecedented wake-up call to the global community from its slumber on the health sector, presents an opportunity for national governance establishments to re-prioritize global targets and reformulate national health policies for human existence. However, SDMs are absolutely crucial to slow down the global coronavirus outbreak, minimizing the number of casualties. But, for millions of refugees living in overcrowded refugee camps worldwide, SDMs are impossible.

<strong>RAMS Right to Health under International Law</strong>

The rights of all RAMS have been adequately provided for under international law. The <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(symbol)/E.C.12.2000.4.En?OpenDocument">right to health</a> has developed rapidly under international law, and its normative amplification has substantial conceptual and functional repercussions for healthcare policies. The international human rights framework provides equality in treatment and justice with accountability. In 1946, the <a href="https://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf">Constitution</a> of the World Health Organization (WHO) was adopted by the comity of nations and it has recognized the “enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health” as a fundamental human right. <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Article 25</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights protects the right to health under all hostile circumstances including pandemics. Article 3, 23, 24 and 33 of the <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/v1crs.htm">1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees</a> is of vital importance and protects the rights of RAMS. <a href="http://docstore.ohchr.org/SelfServices/FilesHandler.ashx?enc=4slQ6QSmlBEDzFEovLCuW1AVC1NkPsgUedPlF1vfPMJ2c7ey6PAz2qaojTzDJmC0y%2B9t%2BsAtGDNzdEqA6SuP2r0w%2F6sVBGTpvTSCbiOr4XVFTqhQY65auTFbQRPWNDxL">Article 12</a> of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and <a href="https://www.escr-net.org/rights/health">General Comment</a> of the ICESCR guarantee state obligations to respect, protect and fulfill the right to health with its core elements like availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality. The right to health is also specifically enunciated in many other international human rights instruments, such as <a href="https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-2&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en">Article 5[e][iv]</a> of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/professionalinterest/cedaw.pdf">Articles 11[1][f]</a> of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">Article 24</a> of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CMW.aspx">Articles 28, 43[1][e], 45[1][c] and 70</a> of the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. At a regional level, there are many provisions for protecting the right to health such as Article 33 of the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man, Article 11 of the European Social Charter, and Article 16 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.

In the present context of unprecedented echelons of human migration, it has been argued that doctors and medical personnel must be redrafted as border security officials manning the borders of a welfare state instead of assuming the mantle of small potentates defining the degree of deprivation in their daily confrontations with RAMS. It poses ethical and moral questions for medical personnel and, therefore, healthcare and immigration policies are combined and both are regarded as a field of public policy. Therefore, rights of RAMS are perceived in a collective trajectory rather than in individual context. In other words, there is a conflict between individual human rights of RAMS and their migration status, which makes a case for a more <a href="https://www.hhrjournal.org/2016/12/interpreting-the-international-right-to-health-in-a-human-rights-based-approach-to-health/">human rights-based approach</a> (HRBA) to the right to health. Therefore, it must be critically appreciated that the human rights of RAMS guarantee them an inalienable right to health at all stages of their displacement and migration. It is axiomatic from the above deliberation that there is a link between the right to access healthcare and the right to asylum with an HRBA-driven asylum procedure. Yet, nation-states abuse the connection between individual human rights to healthcare services and the right to social security. Moreover, RAMS are often discriminated against in migration and upon arrival due to their migration status, deprivation of access to healthcare services is resorted to by the border check-posts to exclude RAMS from their right to seek asylum.

<strong>Recommendations for RAMS under COVID-19</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>That the rights of RAMS under international law and constitutional law have attained extraordinary attention. In the wake of exceptional times of the COVID-19 emergency, the same must be protected by the countries of reception;</li>
 	<li>That all RAMS in destination countries, detention centers, and repatriation facilities must be treated as permanent citizens during COVID-19 pandemic;</li>
 	<li>That all RAMS must have access to public services like seeking refugee status, socio-economic welfare benefits, healthcare, including mental healthcare, water and energy needs in the host countries.</li>
 	<li>That these measures require unprecedented medical preparedness of the countries of asylum to defeat and to minimize the risk of contagion between border security personnel and RAMS applicants;</li>
</ul>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The reasons for displacement and migration include severe weather conditions, climate change disasters, socio-political crises, conflict, war and struggle for basic necessities for human survival. There are more than 70.8 million people who have been forced to flee their country of origin. Receiving countries are not necessarily ready or in a position to provide protection to those who have been displaced. In order to improve the conditions for forcibly displaced people all over the world, there is an urgency to assess the reasons behind their displacement and migration as the same defines the migration status of RAMS under international law. In turn, migration status impacts the requirements of countries to grant asylum and provide for the rights to protection and assistance enjoyed by RAMS. Thus, the right to health is conceived in multiple terms in different human rights instruments for its protection with a relative degree of commitment. Therefore, the state obligations that arise from the ratification of these instruments must include the unfettered canopy of protection of RAMS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The COVID-19 outbreak has shocked and de-globalized the international community. The World Health Organization (WHO) has <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">declared</a> the outbreak a pandemic and several scholars have argued that China <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-outbreak-of-covid-19-coronavirus-are-the-international-health-regulations-fit-for-purpose/">breached</a> International Health Regulations (IHR) by not preventing the spread of the deadly COVID-19. The <a href="https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/">IHR</a> aim to aid the international community in preventing and responding to acute public health crises with the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The IHR work through an emergency committee that provides technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern,”  which is defined as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to require a coordinated international response potentially.” The views of the world community are that China has not complied with the IHR, in particular scholars maintain that China violated Article 7 of the IHR concerning information-sharing and Article 3 which categorically states that the IHR principles shall be respected with full dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms. This being the case, one could argue that China breached the human rights of its citizens by not respecting the IHR principles. The mechanism under Article 56 of the IHR provides for arbitration as a means of settlement of a dispute with the consent of the disputed state, in this instance obtaining the consent of China is highly unlikely; moreover, one of the prerequisites for Article 56 to be put into operation is the existence of a ‘dispute.’

<strong><u>The WHO and COVID-19</u></strong>

States could invoke Article 21 and 22 of the <a href="https://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf">WHO Constitution</a> as a basis for establishing the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Article 21 provides the World Health Assembly the power to establish regulations like the IHR. I am of the view that the assembly and the subsequent regulations constitute the <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198787822.001.0001/oso-9780198787822-chapter-2">subsequent practice</a> of the WHO Constitution; hence, the subject matter relates to the interpretation of the WHO Constitution. A State could in all probability bring multiple claims against China for violation of the WHO Constitution; firstly under Chapter XIV of the constitution, each state party is under an obligation to submit a statistical public health report. Further, Article 6(2) of the IHR states
<blockquote>a State Party shall continue to communicate to WHO timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to it on the notified event, where possible including case definitions, laboratory results, source and type of the risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed; and report, when necessary, the difficulties faced and support needed in responding to the potential public health emergency of international concern.</blockquote>
Similarly, Article 7 provides for information sharing. Therefore, any state willing to drag China to the ICJ could claim the breach of Article 6 and 7 of the IHR.

Moreover, one of the salient rules of treaty interpretation is the principle of good faith as codified under Article 31 of the <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201155/volume-1155-I-18232-English.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a>. With respect to the performance of the treaty mandate, China was in blatant violation of the good faith principle. Apart from Article 6 and 7 of the IHR being violated, States could also forward claims for the breach of Article 37 by not respecting the WHO by providing inaccurate data on COVID-19. Notwithstanding the potential for multiple claims against China, one has ascertained the jurisdictional compatibility of these claims.

<strong><u>The ICJ's Jurisdiction <em>vis-à-vis</em> COVID-19</u></strong>

The basis for the jurisdiction of the ICJ is Article 75 of the WHO Constitution, which states “Any question or dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Constitution which is not settled by negotiation or by the Health Assembly shall be referred to the International Court of Justice in conformity with the Statute of the Court unless the parties concerned agree on another mode of settlement.”

The state intending to drag China to the ICJ must satisfy the criterion of negotiation to invoke the jurisdiction of the ICJ. In the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/168/168-20190717-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf">Jadhav Case, </a>when interpreting the optional protocol to the Vienna convention on consular relation, the ICJ noted that recourse to arbitration is not a prerequisite to approaching the world court. Drawing from the <em>Jadhav</em> reazoning, the ICJ would exempt the negotiation criterion in Article 75 of WHO Constitution. The fundamental problem that states would encounter while pulling China to the ICJ is the establishment of a dispute, under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute. The function of the ICJ is only to decide international law disputes that states submit, popularly called <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195369380.001.0001/acref-9780195369380-e-1478">‘non ultra petita rule’</a>, and according to Article 36, paragraph 2 of the <a href="https://legal.un.org/avl/pdf/ha/sicj/icj_statute_e.pdf">ICJ Statute,</a> the court’s jurisdiction extends to all “legal disputes” that may arise between states party to the Statute having made a declaration under that provision. The existence of a dispute between parties is thus a condition of the court’s jurisdiction, and the<a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/74/074-19881220-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf"> burden of proving the existence</a> of the dispute falls on the applicant. Therefore, any state contemplating bringing a claim against China has to establish the existence of a dispute. The ICJ has applied stringent interpretation when determining the existence of a dispute. In the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/160/160-20161005-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf">Marshall Islands case</a>, the ICJ rejected the argument of the Marshall Islands by a vote of nine to seven on this precise question. Only if the issue of ‘dispute’ is settled can the ICJ proceed on the merits of the case.

<strong><u>Advisory Opinion – The Way Forward </u></strong>

The jurisdictional hurdles in the ICJ concerning the contentious cases could prompt the WHO to request an advisory opinion. Article 76 of the WHO Constitution provides that
<blockquote>Upon authorization by the General Assembly of the United Nations or upon authorization by any agreement between the Organization and the United Nations, the Organization may request the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on any legal question arising within the competence of the Organization.</blockquote>
The sole criterion to be fulfilled for requesting an advisory opinion is that the request should be a legal question within the scope of the activities of the requesting organ. In 1993, the WHO requested the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/93/093-19960708-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf">on the use of nuclear weapons by a State in war or other armed conflicts</a> for breach of its obligations under international law including the WHO Constitution. The ICJ concluded that the responsibilities of the WHO was necessarily restricted to the sphere of “public health” and therefore could not encroach on the responsibilities of other parts of the United Nations system. Since the present COVID-19 pandemic primarily falls under the ambit of “public health,” the WHO is competent to request an advisory opinion as it falls within its mandate. The advantages of requesting an advisory opinion are manifold. Firstly, to date the ICJ has rendered <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/advisory-proceedings">27 advisory opinions</a>. While advisory opinions are not binding on state, they lay down a path for the subsequent course of action. In the instant case, it could assist the General Assembly to pass resolutions condemning the passivity of China in controlling the spread of the pandemic. Secondly, in the landmark advisory opinion <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf">Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory</a>, the ICJ observed that victims can be provided reparations. Drawing the same analogy, China can be instructed by the ICJ to compensate for losses. Thirdly, the advisory opinion does not require the consent of states; this can offer scope for judicial activism and transcend the passivity that is associated with contentious cases. Fourthly, in an advisory opinion every state is provided with an opportunity to submit relevant evidence and facts. The court gets to decide on the basis of all the available evidence at its disposal thus ensuring evidentiary propriety.

<strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>

The present crisis can allure states to approach the ICJ against China; however, the probability of success is very slim because the question of dispute, as pointed out above, would be difficult to establish. Secondly, assuming that the ICJ decides on the merits, the enforcement happens at the Security Council, China as a permanent member of the UN could veto the enforcement of the judgment as <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/70/070-19841126-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf">previously witnessed</a> in the ICJ. Therefore, it will be a safe bet to place the ball in the court of the General Assembly for further course of action through an advisory opinion from the ICJ. Further, by rendering an advisory opinion on such a massive issue the ICJ could set a right precedent by regulating the conduct of states and thus participate proactively in the fruitful functioning of the United Nations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, it takes a crisis to make a change. Especially for the legal profession, which is notoriously allergic to change, no matter how necessary. For decades, the legal profession has debated how and why to evaluate attorneys before admitting them to the bar. But it looks like the COVID-19 pandemic may finally force its hand.

COVID-19 has already massively impacted legal education. Every law school in the country suddenly went online in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester, some with a week or less notice to students and faculty. Professors are struggling to learn new technology and teaching methods on the fly, and students are struggling to learn already difficult ideas in a new and unfamiliar setting.

As a consequence, most law schools have decided to abandon the traditional law school curve, and adopt mandatory pass/fail grading for the Spring 2020 semester. It is hard to overstate how momentous a change that simple - and frankly, obvious - decision reflected. After all, ranking is embedded deep in the DNA of the legal academy. Many professors resisted, and even some students, but good sense soon won out. After all, in the best of circumstances, law school grades are notoriously unpredictable and comically divorced from any reliable assessment of knowledge or understanding. Chaos just made the pretext of objectivity untenable.

But what about the bar exam? Most graduating law students take the bar exam in July. Even before law schools went online, people <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/03/an-open-letter-to-the-national-conference-of-bar-examiners/">started wondering</a> whether a July exam was realistic. And the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) has now rescheduled until Fall 2020, circumstances permitting.

While the NCBE was right to postpone, its proposal is still unrealistic and unsafe. The pandemic may still be raging, and large gatherings of people will almost certainly be dangerous. A 2020 bar exam probably will not, and should not happen.

That is a terrible burden on graduating law students, who have invested immense amounts of time, money, and labor in the expectation that they would be able to practice law. No bar exam means no bar admission, which means no practicing law. Students are already losing job offers left and right and scrambling to find work, even as it dries up everywhere.

Not to mention the disruption in their studies. Law schools have already acknowledged that the pandemic makes it impossible to grade students on the traditional curve. But studying for the bar is no different, and the NCBE should admit the same. Students won’t receive the same educational resources, because their schools are closed. And many students will experience personal burdens that make it even harder to study for the bar exam.

So why have an exam at all? Why not just admit every student who graduates from an accredited law school in 2020 to the bar? After all, the “diploma privilege” is nothing new. Wisconsin adopted it in 1870, and New Hampshire joined in 2005, admitting any applicant who graduated from an accredited in-state school.

Many students have already called for a diploma privilege for 2020 law school graduates. And on April 5, a group of law professors circulated a <a href="https://twitter.com/j_witmerrich/status/1246887115293679617">petition</a>, arguing not only that administering a bar exam would be unfair and unsafe, but also that we will need all of those new lawyers to help resolve the legal issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. After all, the number of unemployment, eviction, insurance, and tort claims, as well as bankruptcies, are likely to explode, and many of the people affected will need low-cost or pro-bono representation. Why not ensure more new lawyers sooner, who are ready to address the problem?

But maybe this is also an opportunity to ask why we don’t adopt a permanent, universal diploma privilege. After all, if a student has graduated from an accredited law school, they should be qualified to practice law. What is the purpose of administering yet another test, other than limiting the number of attorneys admitted to practice? While restricting competition is attractive to existing attorneys - especially the lowest quality ones - it is not a legitimate reason for limiting admission to the bar.

Of course, the ostensible purpose of the bar exam is to ensure that attorneys are competent to practice. But no one seriously claims it achieves that goal, except maybe accidentally. Sure, another test is yet another signal of a prospective attorney’s willingness and ability to memorize esoteric rules they will never apply in practice. We have plenty of those already.

A bar exam that actually tested objective competence might be justified. But that’s not the bar exam we have, and it’s obviously not the bar exam the profession wants. After all, when the bar increases the “cut score” on the bar exam, supposedly in order to police attorney competence, it doesn’t make the increase retroactive. If a particular score reflects incompetence this year, surely it reflected incompetence last year, and ten years ago as well? And if a prominent law professor can fail a bar exam, simply for want of time to memorize state-specific rules, who can seriously argue the exam is measuring competence?

If the legal profession cared about attorney competence, it would do more - anything, really! - to police the competence of the attorneys already admitted to the bar. While I teach professional responsibility, the real title of the class is “managing the legal cartel.” The bar exam is an integral part of that project. To my mind, that’s no endorsement. We should have abandoned it a long time ago, but there’s no time like the present.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the astonishing speed of the spread of COVID-19 – affecting more than 199 countries, 1,315,989 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 74,000 deaths – many countries are <a href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/sg_report_socio-economic_impact_of_covid19.pdf">implementing</a> extraordinary measures to meet this unprecedented challenge and to cope with the severe implications of the coronavirus crisis. The key measures of the containment strategy have entailed multiple <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/human-rights-dimensions-covid-19-response">restrictions</a> on the enjoyment of fundamental civil and political liberties, such as freedom of movement, and freedom of assembly and association.

Besides enforcing these restrictions to prevent the exposure of individuals to the coronavirus, the explosive spread of the virus presents a serious challenge to governments’ capacity to adopt measures that ensure the full and effective protection of all those infected or potentially exposed. It is particularly challenging to ensure the care of <span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/coronavirus-how-human-rights-help-protect-us/">vulnerable populations</a></span> – such as older people, people living in poverty, people in jails and immigration detention centers, and health workers on the frontline of this pandemic – who are at greater risk of severe illness and death.

In the midst of this emergency situation, increasing attention is being paid to whether the temporary disruption of fundamental freedoms is in compliance with <span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/law-in-times-of-crisis/974A70D71A5F4599717675E87CA935DC">international law</a></span>, both health-related obligations under the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/international-health-regulations-(2005)-third-edition">International Health Regulations</a> (IHR) and human rights protections included in instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25668&amp;LangID=E">emphasized</a> by the <span>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</span> “COVID-19 is a test for our societies, and we are all learning and adapting as we respond to the virus. Human dignity and rights need to be front and center in that effort, not an afterthought.”

<strong>State of Emergency, International Health Regulations and Human Rights Limitations</strong>

States primarily look to the 2005 IHR to shape their responses to the global spread of disease. This binding and global universal instrument, implemented on 15 June 2007 with 196 states parties, is based on an “<span><a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-outbreak-of-covid-19-coronavirus-are-the-international-health-regulations-fit-for-purpose/">open-ended approach</a></span>” to ensure “effective and proportional public health responses.” The declaration of the coronavirus outbreak as a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) guided the WHO’s Director-General to adopt recommendations about travel and trade and made the international community aware of the need to urgently react to prevent disease spread and to enhance global cooperation.

Since the declaration of a PHEIC on 30 January 2020, the major locus of activity has been the state and several countries have declared a “state of emergency” to adopt <em>ad hoc</em> legislation and to vest vast authority in the executive branch. If this is understandable in managing front-line legal responses in the midst of what is undoubtedly <span>an emergency situation</span>, there is an implicit need to prevent governments from “exploiting momentary panic to impose <span><a href="https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4900&amp;context=ylj">long-lasting limitations on liberty</a></span>.” A group of <span>UN experts</span> <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25722&amp;LangID=E">warned</a> on 16 March 2020 that:
<blockquote>emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a basis to target particular groups, minorities, or individuals. It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health ... and should not be used simply to quash dissent.</blockquote>
This is a challenge confronting all democracies, specifically due to the fact that countries seem to <span>lack not only political and social immunity</span> but also a “normative” immunity.

The overall picture of the emergency powers frameworks seem to divert under several profiles: first, in terms of their definition of limited regimes and their path toward termination. For instance, the time of necessity that legitimates the allocation of emergency powers varies, for instance, from 14 days in Portugal to two months in France to two years in the UK to “without any end” in Hungary, which poses the concrete risk of normalizing emergency measures. But most importantly, the logic of pandemic-talk that is leading to the design of emergency frameworks reveals a fragmented legal landscape that risks becoming a two-edged sword if adequate limits – such as proportionality and necessity – are not respected in balancing collective needs and individual liberties. Italy, one of the worst affected countries in terms of numbers of infections and deaths (132,547 confirmed cases and 16,523 deaths as of 6 April), was one of the first European countries to adopt strict containment measures. Faced with the absence of a constitutional text regulating an <span><a href="http://www.questionegiustizia.it/stampa.php?id=2389">emergency regime</a></span>, the Italian government adopted a technocratic approach with the primary objective of ensuring a collective and effective response, which gradually subjected its entire population – 60 million people – to unprecedented restrictions of their fundamental freedoms.

The entry point in the public health emergency has been, even before the declaration of a PHEIC, the adoption of several <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/03/italy-coronavirus-covid19-west-europe-future/607660/">mobility restrictions</a></span> - travel bans, borders protections, together with the suspension or rerouting of flights from China –  to prevent the spread of COVID-19. As of 5 April, the <span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/01/more-than-nine-in-ten-people-worldwide-live-in-countries-with-travel-restrictions-amid-covid-19/?utm_source=IOM+External+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=e6143cfa35-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_02_04_19&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9968056566-e6143cfa35-43546485">majority of countries</a></span> have adopted<span> travel restrictions</span> that affect freedom of movement which includes the freedom to leave any country, the freedom to enter one’s own country, and the right to move freely in the whole territory of the country (<span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">art. 12</a></span> of the ICCPR). While initially most of these restrictions targeted foreigners who live or have visited “virus hubs”, they are now being applied to entire countries. Serious concerns have been raised about not only their effectiveness in controlling the spread of the disease but especially about their potential detrimental effects. Both in the <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25358040">shorter term</a></span> – by delaying the spread of the virus by only a few weeks in other countries and disproportionately harming the most vulnerable - and in the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30373-1/fulltext">longer term</a> – the lack of adherence to international law risks “undermining the <span>broader rules-based</span> world order.”

In fact, many national regulations are deviating from the <span><a href="Updated%20WHO%20advice%20for%20international%20traffic%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20outbreak%20of%20the%20novel%20coronavirus%202019-nCoV">WHO</a></span> recommendation that continues to advise “against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.” As stated, “travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact.” In this context, only 23 countries have reported mobility restrictions to the WHO in line with legal requirements, and this knowledge gap significantly impacts the ability to understand the legal implication of the deviations from such recommendation. As argued by <span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30373-1/fulltext">Habibi et al</a></span>., the adoption of preventative measures that interfere with human freedoms requires scientific evidence and even if more restrictive measures could be adopted they need to be “commensurate with the risks involved, and anchored in human rights” (art. 3.1 IHR).

The UN Human Rights Committee adopted two general comments on <span>states of emergency</span> and <span><a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/45139c394.html">freedom of movement</a></span> that provide guidelines to define the scope of human rights limitations and <span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/international-human-rights-law/derogations-in-time-of-public-emergency/F272993A6394AE61268F07DBD4BEFC31">derogations</a></span> in emergency situations. According to Article 2, Paragraph 3, limitations may be designed to meet a specific objective – to protect public health -  without undermining the essence of the right. They need to be grounded on a legal basis and to meet the test of necessity and proportionality (to temporally limit the spread of the coronavirus). So far, it is currently <span><a href="http://www.sidiblog.org/2020/03/27/nous-sommes-en-guerre-la-lotta-globale-alla-pandemia-alla-prova-del-patto-internazionale-sui-diritti-civili-e-politici/">debated</a></span> if the containment measures adopted until now are taking place through prudent limitations – so with a less severe effect-  or instead through derogations that are only admissible in times of public emergency threatening the life of a nation by affecting the core security and independence (art. 4 ICCPR). In this exceptional case countries are required to report those measures to the <span>United Nations Secretary General</span><span>.</span>  As of 5 April, 7 countries (Armenia, Ecuador, Estonia, Guatemala, Latvia, Romania, Peru) have exercised their right of derogation from obligations under Article 12 of the ICCPR. The current scenario is clearly in a state of flux.

The current practice of declaring a state of emergency has varied impacts on human rights, which makes identifying how to limit their normative expansion crucial. For instance, already, in a number of states in Europe, elections (generally municipal ones) have been delayed on account of the pandemic. <span><a href="https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4900&amp;context=ylj">Acherman</a></span> suggested that certain liberties could be exempted from the regime of derogation by “insulating political expression” for instance, crucial to ensure the vitality of our democracies. The human rights treaties “<span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/human-rights-in-emergencies/introduction/0799E2E4B85C4B6827C219F35D1163EC">don’t speak with one voice</a></span>” in making a distinction between derogable and non-derogable rights. The American Convention of Human Rights alone characterizes as non-derogable the right to participate in government, but it is not the case in the ICCPR or the ECHR. This remains a point that merits closer consideration.

Although the twenty-first century has been affected by severe outbreaks (eg. Ebola, Zika), many countries in Europe appear unprepared, victims of a kind of “Promethean illusion” to be invulnerable to infectious disease and a normative inertia affected the ability to reform the legal framework. The national plans for pandemic preparedness and response are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28935231">highly fragmented</a>, not always anchored in domestic pandemic legislation as encouraged by the WHO, and this can seriously compromise the collective capacity to meet global threats, as global pandemics. The Italian case alerts us to the potential impacts of this inertia: the government had an emergency plan, not implemented and “painfully inadequate,” that requested to operate in an uncharted territory. Other countries, most notably Switzerland, are framing their response in increasingly sophisticated ways within a <a href="https://jusletter.weblaw.ch/fr/juslissues/2020/1017/la-loi-sur-les-epide_e5389a92d7.html__ONCE&amp;login=false">pandemic response framework</a>. Until now, the Swiss government responded without enacting a coercive lockdown and by emphasizing how effective responses need to reinforce cooperation with science. To this end, the  <a href="https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-78626.html">COVID-19 scientific taskforce</a> has been recently launched to provide scientific support to the government by coordinating national research in the academy.

At the end of the day, it will be difficult to return to normalcy, but we should take advantage of the destabilization we are facing to frame a response that minimizes regression by maximizing long-term protection of individual freedoms in an international system characterized by connection rather isolation. As <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">reiterated</a> by <span>WHO’s Director-General</span>, there are keywords that matter, and that are actionable: “Prevention. Preparedness. Public health. Political leadership. And most of all, People.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since its founding in 1959, the European Court of Human Rights — a court of last resort for disenfranchised people battling the power of often repressive regimes — has safeguarded rights and freedoms in its member states, now some 50 countries strong. Over the years, the court has forced reforms in Russian prisons, come to the aid of families of the disappeared in Chechnya, and pushed Cyprus to take steps to combat sex trafficking. The judges’ track record has made the court the venue of choice for human rights advocates.

Now, the court is facing fire from a little-known organization with ties to some prominent figures on the American far-right—including Jay Sekulow, who served as lead lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump in his recent impeachment trial.

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In February, a group called the European Center for Law and Justice (ECLJ) published a <a href="https://static.eclj.org/pdf/ECLJ+Report%2C+NGOs+and+the+Judges+of+the+ECHR%2C+2009+-+2019%2C+February+2020.pdf">report</a></span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">accusing several prominent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) of having undue influence on the court. While the ECLJ itself is somewhat obscure, its handiwork was widely circulated by conspiracy theorists and conservative outlets such as the right-wing French magazine <em>Valeurs</em>. </span>

The ECLJ tries to paint a picture of a left-leaning, biased court dominated by civil society actors. Among the report’s foremost targets: George Soros – an American investor, philanthropist and human rights champion – and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), an international grant-making network supporting press freedom, democracy, and civil society throughout the world.

Since 1997, OSF has spent over $15 billion on these endeavors. But in these times of populist hysteria, George Soros has become a figure that authoritarian governments love to hate. He’s maligned by the far-right, accused of being the puppet master behind an array of socialist movements. More often than not, attacks on him are shot through with falsehoods and propaganda, and the anti-Semitic undertones are hard to miss.

In the latest attacks, the ECLJ accuses Soros, OSF and other influential organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch of being part of a larger conspiracy to manipulate the decisions of the Court and corrupting the selection of its judges.

The ECLJ happens to be the European arm of the American Center for Law and Justice, founded by the American televangelist Pat Robertson, who himself has pushed <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-10-10-me-636-story.html">theories</a> of Jewish world domination. Its director, Gregor Puppinck, is known for his impulsive <a href="https://c-fam.org/?s=Gr%C3%A9gor+Puppinck&amp;post_type=turtle_bay">conspiracy theories</a>, and its chief counsel, Jay Sekulow, was a longtime advocate for the evangelical Christian right before signing on as Trump’s counsel.

The ECLJ report is littered with inconsistencies and peddles outlandish fallacies and fabrications. It eagerly asserts the anti-liberal narrative that Soros, and the human rights community in general, is corrupting the selection process of ECHR judges. In doing so, the report resorts to tabloid-style speculation and ignores facts:

Fact one: Article 21 of the court’s mandate provides that “the judges shall be of high moral character and must either possess the qualifications required for appointment to high judicial office or be jurisconsults of recognized competence.”

Fact two: The judicial election process starts at the national level where three potential candidates are identified. The candidates must generally demonstrate “professional reputation of the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms” and “high moral character, impartiality and integrity.”

Fact three: Once candidates pass through the national nomination stage they face a number of other checks. Thus, before the vote, candidates must undergo a series of <a href="http://www.assembly.coe.int/LifeRay/CDH/Pdf/ProcedureElectionJudges-EN.pdf">interviews</a> before the Subcommittee on the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly.

Fact four: The Parliamentary Assembly can reject a proposed national election list altogether and, in fact, does so quite <a href="http://website-pace.net/documents/1653359/1653617/TableForthcomingJudgesElections-EN.pdf/775de55c-67b8-4f46-befd-1063dca1b5e0.">frequently</a>. For example, through the election process between 2013 and 2018, the Assembly rejected lists from Albania, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Slovakia and Turkey.

Fact Five: Although the judges who are ultimately elected tend to show a degree of activism, they also represent an exceptional diversity in political affiliations, ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. The only main area for improvement is gender diversity.

The ECLJ report also sets out a very dubious assertion of judicial bias because of the alleged “affiliations” of the judges, either as plaintiffs, through amicus curiae, or as third parties. According to their logic, these judges should be blacklisted and prevented from serving on the Court, even if these affiliations were terminated 10, 20 or more years ago.

The notion that a distant past association renders a judge incapable of impartial justice is absurd. There are, of course, circumstances in which judges are required to recuse themselves. However, while international standards remain vague, across Europe grounds for recusal are really quite limited.

The accusations about George Soros are more outlandish still. The ECLJ report suggests the reason Soros’ Central European University is relocating from Budapest to Vienna is heavy taxation by the Hungarian authorities. This claim conveniently overlooks the fact that Hungary has undertaken unparalleled attacks on the rule of law, civil society and political participation, in a concerted effort to drive NGOs out of the country. And Hungary’s leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has sought to demonize Soros, passing a so-called “Stop Soros” law that criminalizes activities supporting asylum applicants and blaming him for what Orbán calls the “Muslim invasion into Christian Europe." Such attacks, part of Orbán’s drive to “make Hungary an illiberal state,” have shrunk the space for civil society in Hungary, diminishing the power of NGOs to defend themselves against this trend.

No system is perfect, and this certainly applies to the European Court of Human Rights. However, this biased and distorted report offers no constructive suggestions for reform. Instead, the ECLJ’s partisan, political bias leads it to distort the realities of civil society organizations and, in keeping with the agendas pursued by autocratic governments, attempt to undermine the Court and the international community at large. The group’s report is also sadly another example of the vilification of George Soros, who personifies the liberal values of civil society, freedom and democratic governance – values that are anathema to autocrats.

		<title>OK, Landlord: Copyright Profits Are Just Rent</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like everyone, the copyright cops want to have their cake and eat it too. They claim that copyright is a kind of property, so the law should protect it just like any other kind of property. But they also claim that authors are morally entitled to copyright ownership because of their special contribution to society. I find both claims uncompelling, but in any case, they can’t have it both ways. If copyright is a property right, they have to own it and can’t claim the moral high ground.

Since time immemorial, copyright owners have argued that copyright is a property right, which should receive the same protections as any other property right. The Supreme Court agrees. Copyright is a bundle of exclusive rights, freely alienable, like any other property right. If it walks like property and quacks like property, surely it’s property, right?

Of course, copyright skeptics have always objected to the property metaphor, observing that works of authorship aren’t like other kinds of property because consumption doesn’t decrease supply. After all, when you consume an apple, there’s one less apple, but when you consume a work of authorship it’s still there, undiminished. If the purpose of property is to encourage efficient consumption, what is the point of property in non-rivalrous goods or, more simply, goods that don't diminish with consumption?

But the copyright cops persist, insisting that copyright is property, so copyright owners are entitled to the entire value of the works they create because that’s what property means. Accordingly, copying a work of authorship without permission is theft, even though it only increases the number of copies, because the copyright owner didn’t profit. And even consuming a work of authorship without permission is wrong because copyright owners are entitled to profit from every use of the work they own.

The circularity of these claims should be obvious: copyright is property because copyright owners receive exclusive rights, and copyright owners receive exclusive rights because copyright is property. But let’s run with it. Okay, copyright is property and copyright owners are property owners. Why are copyright owners entitled to profit from the use of their property?

Because they’re landlords. Copyright owners want to own the property metaphor? Then, let ‘em own it. If copyright is property, then they are landlords and copyright profits are rent. Just like landlords, copyright owners simply make a capital investment in creating or acquiring a property, then sit back and wait for the profits to roll in.

Of course, copyright owners and their proxies object that my analogy is unfair. They’re right, it’s unfair. To landlords.

After all, real estate is a far riskier investment than a commercially valuable work of authorship. For one thing, real estate requires regular maintenance, while intangible works of authorship require nothing but possible policing. For another, real estate is far more volatile, as we’ve seen in recent memory, and are likely to see again in the near future, while valuable works of authorship tend to retain their value. So much so that securitization is pointless, with the notable exception of novelties like Bowie Bonds.

An example. As the COVID-19 pandemic loomed, one small landlord asked the popular website “Am I the Asshole” whether he was wrong to object to the refusal of his newly-unemployed tenants to pay rent. The overwhelming consensus? Oh, hell yes. Indeed, Twitter treated the hapless landlord to a relentless stream of abuse. And Twitter was right! In a moment of crisis, landlords should recognize that their tenants are also in dire straits, and work with them to mitigate their mutual problem.

By contrast, when the Internet Archive created the <a href="https://archive.org/details/nationalemergencylibrary">National Emergency Library</a>, a repository of ebooks intended to provide access to consumers who couldn’t visit the library, the copyright cops went berserk. A claque of authors immediately objected that the Internet Archive was unfairly depriving them of the revenue they needed to survive. And everyone accepted their baloney.

The reality is, those authors were making exactly the same argument as the vilified landlord. Never mind Mike Masnick’s explanation of why the authors were wrong on the merits of what the Internet Archive actually offered. And never mind that none of the authors provided any evidence demonstrating that they actually lost profits because of the Library. Let’s focus on the fact that the authors were complaining because they were worried about an interruption in their revenue stream. Or rather, their potential revenue stream. An observation: when you find yourself criticizing libraries, it’s probably time to step away from the keyboard.

What were they really complaining about? The idea that maybe we shouldn’t think about copyright as a sacrosanct privilege, rooted in the moral virtue of authors, and worthy of protection against all comers. Why do they hate being compared to landlords? Because it hits way too close to home. Landlords can claim the moral high ground. But they rarely succeed. For better or worse, no one likes a landlord. Should we like copyright owners any better?

Now, let me stipulate that I have nothing against either landlords or copyright owners. Both have their place, and both play an important economic role, historically and today. But let’s not pretend that authors are any better than any other kind of property owner. If property is property, it’s time to admit it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Law students across the country are rallying like never before, launching ground-up, grassroots movements urging their respective state bars to forgo the traditional bar exam in favor of emergency diploma privilege in light of the COVID-19 crisis. One <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PwPF3xULlo3jd3YWV1IQ4WDMC_tHEJ1OPJyV4sVy8iQ/viewform?edit_requested=true&amp;fbclid=IwAR3UmRu-O_nyX-IFXmargRZZOxf6FG9EvB-wWYg7PFJJp0ApD5Q0bmyu7UA">letter</a> addressed to the NCBE has amassed over 2,000 signatures. Another <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNgaQEcYzrDxiIaniNO5KE6bXA88Uwj1h0Xw_U4jrjg48TWg/alreadyresponded">letter</a>, sent to the California State Bar, has over 1,300 signatures. States with a small number of bar-takers, like Kentucky, have garnered a significant number of <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Of0oODqEur1wq4Lypx_-UWTrp4IbbMR6-7p4PeAraME/edit">signatures</a> in favor of emergency diploma privilege. A trio of law professors has even started their own <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7Nc7wiDGLYizszyaShcSNpZwy0KdIlV1h5YD4YwVcFklbEQ/viewform">petition</a> and have amassed over 300 signatures from law faculty across the country.

In the coming months, there will be a critical need for lawyers as people continue to feel the physical, social, and economic impact of COVID-19. This global pandemic, coupled with no new lawyers entering the profession if the bar is postponed or canceled, is only going to exacerbate the lack of access to justice issues in this country. Many courts across the country have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/14/815778399/what-happens-to-peoples-legal-cases-as-coronavirus-shuts-down-courts">shut down</a>, which means an immense backlog of cases in the legal system is inevitable. The police are not going to stop arresting people, and prosecutors are not going to stop asking for high bonds to keep poor people in jail pretrial. Some jurisdictions, like D.C., have threatened to throw people in jail for up to 90 days for violating stay-at-home orders, even though sitting in jail pretrial during a global pandemic could very well be a death sentence. Holding—or postponing—the July 2020 bar will have a devastating impact on marginalized communities and law students alike.

<strong>Is the bar exam really needed? </strong>

The most popular argument <a href="https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/04/08/making-the-case-for-provisional-bar-licenses-in-the-coronavirus-pandemic/?fbclid=IwAR0DyON989oHl-NMVV1yxb7fTUdoQ6_1jvsLgTxcH3NrQyBrkvEC2Z3kfgk">advanced</a> against diploma privilege is that the bar exam acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring the quality of legal services and protecting the public from incompetent lawyers. Yet, the California State Bar has admitted—albeit in a significantly downplayed <a href="http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/reports/2017-Final-Bar-Exam-Report.pdf">2017-report</a>—that its bar exam does not actually protect the public from incompetent lawyers. This begs the question: if the exam, as admitted by the California State Bar, is not actually protecting the public from “bad” lawyers, what purpose is it serving?

We find it troubling and impossible to reconcile the California State Bar’s 2017 report findings with its purported purpose of the bar exam. The most probable answer to such an inconsistency is that the bar exam is arbitrary and does not actually prepare lawyers to practice law in any meaningful way. States did not even require a written bar exam to practice law before the late nineteenth century. Before then, lawyers—even “great” ones like Abraham Lincoln—“read” the law, meaning they did not attend law school and certainly did not take or pass a written bar exam. Accordingly, scholars have pointed out that there is no research to suggest that legal malpractice is any less frequent today because of the bar exam than it was before the bar exam as we know it existed.

Some state bars have attempted to measure incompetence by the number of disciplinary actions taken against a lawyer. Even if a positive correlation existed between disciplinary actions and lawyer incompetence, the metric would still be problematic considering that state bars do not <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/california-bar-study-finds-racial-disparities-in-lawyer-discipline">discipline</a> white lawyers at the same rates that they discipline lawyers of color. But, even with that, there is also no research to suggest that Wisconsin and New Hampshire—the two states that presently employ diploma privilege—have a higher incidence of attorney misconduct.

<strong>Why is diploma privilege the best alternative?</strong>

One of the most common bar exam alternatives being considered by states across the country is postponement of the exam to fall 2020. However, current models suggest that large group gatherings may not return <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-social-distancing-over-back-to-normal/608752/">this calendar year</a></em>. Experts expect second and third waves of COVID-19 infections, extending into the fall and winter until a vaccine is made commercially available. Moreover, bar exams nationwide are held in large venues, often accommodating over 1,000 exam takers in a single room. The enormity of the bar exam in tandem with the potential for subsequent waves of the virus place students and test administrators at grave risk of infection, and in turn is likely to place public health and safety at risk. The last thing that the public needs is a COVID-19 outbreak at a massive testing site for an exam that admittedly fails to protect the public from bad lawyers.

Small group administration is another option some are calling for. This option is, however, overwhelmingly impractical, especially in states the size of California or New York. The bar administration, in just a few months, would need to find hundreds of small venues willing and able to administer the exam, in addition to hiring and training countless test administrators. Will enough test administrators be willing to risk their safety and health to staff the hundreds of concurrent bar administrations throughout the state? The cost and feasibility of this option are prohibitive. This option also fails to consider the impact that COVID-19 may have on the health of law students. How many students, if offered this option, would be willing to defy shelter-in-place orders to take the exam?

The potential to administer an online bar exam has been met with appropriate skepticism. Judith Gundersen, the head of the NCBE, noted that the feasibility of administering an online bar exam is questionable. An online bar exam opens the door for cheating, unequal access to computers and the internet, and software glitches during exam administration. In the few short months, bar examiners would have to put together a framework for online administration and in all likelihood numerous, important questions about the feasibility and logistics of the online exam would arise. Bar examiners are wholly unprepared to answer these novel questions in the narrow time-frame before the summer exam administration.

Supervised practice also presents issues, given that many of those who have advanced this approach do not address how this would differently affect certain types of practice. For example, students hoping to begin a solo practice would not have an attorney supervisor. Would the potential to open a solo practice be hindered? Also, students who will enter public service as Public Defenders and District Attorneys are unclear as to whether they would be able to appear on the record as an attorney on behalf of clients and the state.

Diploma privilege is the only humane option. It protects the health of students while also ensuring fair and equitable admission to the bar. It is also the only practical method of licensure in the midst of COVID-19. With diploma privilege, students can enter the profession to zealously meet the needs of clients, especially those individuals and families who need legal aid the most.

<strong>But aren’t you just entitled millennials asking for a handout?</strong>

As with any movement that is in direct opposition to the status quo of the power structure, there is vehement opposition to emergency diploma privilege. Opposition groups have had a seemingly allergic reaction to the thought of emergency diploma privilege, chalking it up to entitled, lazy millennials taking advantage of a global pandemic. Asking for compassionate relief during the largest disruption of society since WWII is not asking for a handout. Many students would gladly take the bar exam, as we have always anticipated doing if it were possible to administer the exam in a timely and safe manner. However, during this unprecedented national crisis, a safe, timely bar administration is not possible. What we are asking for is not a handout, but a way to continue along the pathways we have charted for ourselves and our communities and to honor the commitments we made when we anticipated sitting for the July bar exam.

What we are asking is for bar administrators to allow us to serve our communities, that are, and will be, in greater need of legal services than ever before. Our clients are numerous and diverse: tenants at risk of eviction, workers entitled to protection or back-pay, small businesses that need tax advice, presumed innocent individuals awaiting a Constitutionally-guaranteed speedy trial, and immigrants that await postponed bond hearings. These examples are illustrative and non-exhaustive, indicative of a spike in the need for legal services that we want to address as quickly as is possible.

It bears repeating: in order to dispel the air of entitlement many associate with millennials—we would gladly take the July bar if we could. But, we cannot. And we cannot allow COVID-19 to further disrupt the vital legal services we are trained for and experienced in giving. We implore the granting of diploma privilege as the humane, fair, and appropriate option for both students intending to sit for the summer bar exam, and for the communities we will serve as lawyers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a truism that when lobbyists push a bill supposedly intended to help the disadvantaged, the real beneficiary is someone else. After all, lobbyists don’t work for free, and the disadvantaged can’t afford to hire them.

The<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2426/text"> Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement</a> (CASE) Act is no exception. At least, in theory, the CASE Act is intended to help small copyright owners enforce their copyrights by providing a low-cost alternative to litigating in federal court. But in reality, the CASE Act will just help predatory law firms extract even more unjustified settlements from unsuspecting businesses and charities.

The CASE Act would create a “small claims copyright court” in the Copyright Office, where small copyright owners could file infringement actions. But most small copyright owners don’t want or need any such thing. If someone infringes one of their copyrights, they just want that person to stop. Usually, a friendly letter does the trick. If not, a stern reminder is even more successful. If the infringer persists, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17">Copyright Act</a> provides generous statutory damages, up to $150,000 per infringement. And copyright owners can recover actual damages from commercial infringers.

In other words, the CASE Act is a solution in search of a problem. Most copyright infringement disputes are resolved amicably by the parties, often without the involvement of lawyers. More often than not, they are the result of a misunderstanding. Sometimes, different creative communities have different expectations about use and attribution, and people need to negotiate a mutually agreeable compromise.

But the CASE Act is catnip for copyright trolls, or law firms that threaten meritless copyright infringement actions in order to extract settlements. For example, I am a board member of a grassroots charity focused on art film. About a year ago, we received a threatening email from a law firm. One of our interns wrote an article about one of the movies we were showing and illustrated it with a photograph from the internet, which appeared to be a publicity still for the movie. The law firm claimed to represent the photographer and said it would file a copyright infringement action for $150,000 unless we settled for $5,000. We immediately removed the image from our website, but the law firm didn’t care, they only wanted money.

As a copyright law professor, I advised the charity that using an image from a movie to illustrate an article about that movie is generally a non-infringing fair use and told the law firm to go pound sand. But many businesses and charities don’t have law professors offering free legal advice and are bullied into settlements.

The CASE Act will only make it cheaper and easier for copyright troll law firms to pursue meritless claims and enable them to extort settlements from blameless defendants. Trolls won’t even have to file an actual complaint in federal court, just what amounts to an administrative action before an agency appointee. That’s a mighty big stick, compared to a threatening letter. Add to it that asserting fair use is already a gamble for defendants, as federal judges often don’t understand the doctrine and are reluctant to apply it. Administrative officers are even more likely to rule in favor of copyright plaintiffs, even when equity favors the defendant.

The last thing we need is more copyright litigation. The CASE Act is a terrible idea. If it becomes a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic, it won’t be missed.

		<title>Immigrant Detention and Removal Are Not Essential</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court has temporarily <a href="/news/2020/04/the-supreme-court-postpones-oral-arguments-scheduled-for-april-as-a-result-of-coronovirus-pandemic/">postponed</a> oral arguments; most state and local courts have as well. Yet, despite the risk posed by COVID-19, immigration courts across America continue to hold in-person removal proceedings. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-17/for-ice-agents-its-business-as-unusual-day-after-sweeping-coronavirus-order">continues</a> apprehensions. Individuals are still being placed on international flights and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/08/world/americas/ap-lt-virus-outbreak-guatemala-deportations.html?searchResultPosition=1">deported</a> to their home countries.

The Trump administration began <a href="/special-coverage-of-covid-19/#public-orders">issuing</a> country-specific travel restrictions in early February. On March 15, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended no gatherings of more than 50, a day later it reduced the recommended gathering size to no more than 10. Both of the US land borders have been closed to all but essential travel since March 20. As of April 7, all but 8 states have issued state-wide stay at home orders. Yet, immigration courts remain open and deportations continue.

We have all heard by now that we should only leave our homes for essential business. What is essential? Healthcare is essential. Our medical system relies on immigrants. In 2015, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states">17 percent</a> of those working in the medical field were foreign-born. It is not just low-skill workers; 28 percent of physicians and surgeons are immigrants. Immigrants are also essential to our food supply from <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states">farms</a> to <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states">retail</a> stores. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients work on the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states">frontlines</a> of this crisis while <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-health-care-workers-united-states">waiting</a> for a Supreme Court decision that may end the program. Essential businesses rely on foreign-born workers. These workers are essential.

Immigration detention is not essential. Under the Trump administration, immigration detention has not only <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/601/">increased</a>, but detention <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/601/">priorities</a> have shifted as well. The majority (60 percent) of individuals in immigration detention have been charged with no criminal offense. Of those with a criminal charge, the majority are misdemeanors or petty offenses. Less than 10 percent of the more than 38,000 people currently in immigration detention have been charged with what ICE considers a major (level-1) crime. And now, there are <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/601/">reported</a> cases of COVID-19 in immigration detention facilities.

ICE employees have been <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/601/">infected</a>. Detained individuals are transported by detention facility staff to immigration courts to stand before immigration judges and ICE attorneys, and, if they are lucky, beside their own lawyer. Every removal proceeding puts an untold number of people at risk. On March 15, the National Association of Immigrant Judges (NAIJ) <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/601/">filed</a> a joint memo with the American Immigration Lawyer Association (AILA) and the American Federal Government Employee (AFGE) union calling for immigration courts to be closed. Immigrants’ rights organizations have <a href="/news/2020/03/aclu-pushes-for-protection-of-inmates-and-at-risk-immigrants-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">filed</a> a number of lawsuits demanding the release of vulnerable individuals. On April 8, AILA and others <a href="/news/2020/03/aclu-pushes-for-protection-of-inmates-and-at-risk-immigrants-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">filed</a> an emergency temporary restraining order to close the immigration courts. Yet, the courts remain open, the detention centers remain full, and deportations continue.

In the face of such injustice, it is necessary to ask who benefits from this? Clearly, not the American people who rely on immigrants as essential workers. Not the federal employees and immigration advocates that have called for the closure of the courts. The prison industry and President Trump’s political career benefit.

The Trump administration has cracked down on all forms of immigration. These policies cater to his nativist, anti-immigrant base. In the face of widespread public outrage, the administration has not backed down; following up on the Muslim travel bans by separating children from their families and then creating Remain in Mexico and Third Safe Country policies that defy international asylum standards. It is no surprise that a deadly pandemic has done little to change his anti-immigrant stance. His base will not mourn the loss of migrant lives. But how will they justify the collateral damage?

Since Trump took office, the private prison industry has <a href="/news/2020/03/aclu-pushes-for-protection-of-inmates-and-at-risk-immigrants-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/">flourished</a>. Could the profits of the private prison industry be worth more than the health and safety of the individuals involved in the immigration system? How much money would be lost if the government ordered the release of all detained immigrants with no criminal charges? What if all the detainees held for petty offenses were released? Is the administration afraid that if it declares immigration detention and deportation non-essential the people will realize that it was unnecessary from the start? What will happen to the profits of GEO Group and CoreCivic, the two largest private detention corporations? To Trump’s nativist base?

COVID-19 is forcing a conversation in this country about what is essential. For me, when it comes to immigration, the answer is clear. President Trump’s political career and the private prison industry are not essential. Immigrants are essential, immigration detention and deportation are not essential. The health and safety of the people involved in the immigration system are essential.

I add my voice to the NAIJ, AILA, and AFGE and call for the immigration courts to temporarily close. I join the <a href="/news/2020/04/democratic-lawmakers-urge-reduction-of-immigrant-detainee-populations/">Democratic Representatives</a> and immigration advocates that are calling for an immediate reduction in the number of individuals in immigration detention. The status quo serves no legitimate interest and puts us all at risk.

		<title>The COVID-19 Apocalypse - Rules for Survival</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The cult horror film classic, <em>Zombieland</em>, begins two months after a virus turns people into zombies that overrun the US. The lead character learns how to stay alive by living by a code of rules he has created to survive the Zombie Apocalypse. The rules are practical. For example, Rule No. 1 stresses the importance of cardio because sometimes you have to outrun your zombie attacker, while Rule No. 3 urges extra care while visiting a restroom because it involves a closed room with only one route of escape.

Both entertaining and chilling, <em>Zombieland</em> offers a look into a world plunged into chaos and examines how various individuals respond when everything they know has been taken away.

Currently, the global COVID-19 crisis has us living through our own real-life apocalyptic nightmare. Because of its rapid spread, and deadly and highly-contagious nature, many feel that their normal way of life is a thing of the past, never to return. While the coronavirus has not produced zombies, it has certainly created turmoil in many different parts of society.

One of these areas concerns how to handle the population in Texas county jails, a situation that is confronting multiple jurisdictions throughout the US. With Texas having the <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/advocates-fight-to-protect-texas-inmates-from-covid-19/2344887/">second-largest</a> prison population in the country, the Dallas Morning News recently <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2020/04/05/covid-19-spreads-with-close-contact-so-what-do-we-do-about-those-in-jail/">asked</a>, "What should we do about the jail during a pandemic?”

During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 many Texas jails went on lockdown, a practice that is also standard operating procedure during severe flu seasons. Yet, advocates seeking to protect inmates from COVID-19 claim that these measures are insufficient for the disease.

Seeking alternatives for the jail population, counties have been struggling to find a workable strategy, with the solutions having a "feeling their way in the dark" quality. Initially, counties slowed down arrests. Next, they began to refuse to make arrests for certain crimes including theft. Subsequently, some counties began taking more extreme measures, which is when the wheels began to fall off.

On March 29, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-13_jails_and_bail_for_COVID-19_IMAGE_03-29-2020.pdf">executive order</a> which suspended portions of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure pertaining to bail. This was in response to growing outrage stemming from the <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Harris-County-judge-releases-murder-suspect-on-PR-15146741.php">granting</a> of a personal recognizance (PR) bond to a murder suspect by a Harris County District Court judge because of the defendant’s professed fear of contracting COVID-19 in jail.

In effect, Governor Abbott's order precluded judges from releasing certain defendants on PR bonds if they were either charged with or previously convicted of a violent crime or an attempted violent crime.

On April 1, with the coronavirus crisis extending around the globe, Harris County Judge Lena Hidalgo issued an <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/harris-county-jail-inmates-coronavirus-hidalgo-15172131.php">order of release</a> for the purpose of freeing what she called "low-risk inmates" from custody "in order to protect inmates, staff and the public."

Her order was put aside two days later when the 337th District judge, Herb Ritchie, <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2020/04/03/list-inmates-who-will-be-released-from-harris-county-jail-amid-coronavirus-crisis/">voided</a> Judge Hidalgo’s order. Judge Ritchie's order reversing Judge Hidalgo's action applied to felony inmates or probationers in the custody of Harris County officials and under the jurisdiction of the county and district courts.

In response to Governor Abbott's executive order, some judges began setting very low bonds. In one example, a man accused of robbery with bodily injury -- a violent crime -- had <a href="https://abc13.com/inmates-charged-with-violent-crimes-were-found-issued-$300-$500-and-even-$10-bonds-over-the-last-two-days./6070050/">bail set</a> at 10 dollars.

Anticipating that these actions would have a negative impact on crime, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmwahIHUv_s&amp;feature=emb_logo">stated</a> at a press conference that until the coronavirus was resolved, criminals should “chill” and take a break.

In the rush to release defendants from jail, there was no plan regarding what to do with habitual criminals, according to Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2020/04/02/houston-police-chief-burglaries-up-20-percent-after-coronavirus-stay-home-orders/">noted</a> that burglaries in the city had spiked 20 percent as of April 2. Other areas have experienced similar results, with the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-sees-more-burglaries-of-businesses-under-coronavirus-emergency-measures-11586008801">noting</a> that reports of crimes against businesses are up by 75 percent in New York City since the coronavirus shutdown. In addition, <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2020/03/25/covid-19-online-game-players-were-top-target-for-scammers-during-chinas-coronavirus-lockdown">online fraud</a> has increased substantially.

Perhaps most disturbing of all is the increase in domestic violence cases, no doubt exacerbated by the prolonged isolation of family members and other individuals in close quarters. Since mid-March, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200410/us-lockdowns-trigger-surge-in-domestic-violence#1">reported</a> receiving more than 2,300 calls in which the coronavirus was cited as a contributing factor to abuse. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html">worldwide surge</a> in domestic abuse has caused the United Nations to call for urgent action.

In trying to deal with the coronavirus crisis, authorities in numerous jurisdictions around the country seem focused on preventing the virus from getting into the county jails and have neglected public safety. As we have seen with seasonal flu outbreaks, completely stopping the entry of a viral contagion is not possible, and so far, this approach has not worked with COVID-19. As of this writing, <a href="https://abc13.com/health/harris-co-reports-3rd-inmate-to-test-positive-for-covid-19/6072312/">three Harris County inmates</a> have tested positive and another 30 have symptoms consistent with the virus and are awaiting results. In the Dallas County Jail, <a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/confirmed-covid-19-cases-at-dallas-county-jail-now-up-to-28">28 inmates</a> have been confirmed positive for COVID-19. All of this is happening while the crime rate escalates. The coronavirus must not be allowed to be used as a means to obtain a "get out of jail free card."

Public safety must never be regarded as a secondary priority. With isolation orders now extended, our policies must change and adapt as well. The worst thing that could happen would be for the public to take matters into their own hands. Allowing chaos to expand could be the match that sets-off a disastrous sociological wildfire that forces counties to take extreme action.

Texas has a strong castle doctrine, which allows landowners to use lethal force to protect their property. Given the circumstances, one can expect this same instinct for self-preservation to extend to business owners when it comes to safeguarding the means by which they earn a living. There are warning signs that the public is becoming increasingly nervous, apprehensive and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109190/covid-19-pandemic-share-of-persons-worried-about-rioting-and-looting/">worried about COVID-19</a>. The very real possibility of riots breaking out is growing. There are also signs that the public is becoming more aggressive. At some point, the risk of an unruly public will force a change in current policies.

Now is the time to develop strategies to be implemented over the upcoming months. Policies must be put in place that balance the risk of public safety against the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in the jails. Although we all hope they are never needed, counties must make plans now and prepare for a constantly changing environment. It must begin with jurisdictions being diligent in the testing of everyone entering facilities, both defendants, as well as employees. But testing alone is not enough.

So what else can we do to cope with the most widespread pandemic of our lifetimes?

<em>Zombieland's</em> rules of survival can serve as an inspiration for us to lay out our own set of rules to make it through these challenging days. Here are a few:

<strong>-- Rule No. 1 - A Temporary Bail Schedule is Your Friend</strong>

Historically, individuals have been directed away from jail through use of a bail schedule. This allows those who can post a bond according to the scheduled amount to avoid being processed in detention facilities. Instead, they simply follow a walk-through process. Efficient and time-tested, this should be implemented on a temporary basis at the very least.

<strong>-- Rule No. 2 - Do Not Be Camera Shy</strong>

All initial magistration should be accomplished via video conference, thus reducing unneeded in-person exposure to all those involved. With all due apologies to the zombie population, this is a total no-brainer.

<strong>-- Rule No. 3 - A Tracker is Not Just a GPS Device</strong>

Even under normal conditions, tracking who is being held preconviction and for how long is one of the most important challenges facing jails and courts. During the current coronavirus crisis, it is even more important. With courts now having a limited schedule, case backlogs will continue to increase. Tracking is critical because defendants should not be kept in jail longer than any potential sentence that could be imposed.

<strong>-- Rule No. 4 - Diverting Doesn't Mean Avoiding the Problem</strong>

Mental health and drug issues plague a huge percentage of defendants moving through the criminal justice system. Judges should look for ways to redirect these individuals in order to help them find the treatment they need, which will also relieve undue pressure on our courts.

Just as <em>Zombieland's</em> rules evolved out of the harsh reality that was playing out before the characters, the myriad challenges that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic mean we must be astute in continuing to adopt additional rules to effectively deal with them.

The lead character of <em>Zombieland</em> manages to stay alive because he resolutely adheres to his own rules of survival, which he has created on the fly and out of single-minded, practical necessity. Sure, it's just a movie, but one with a lesson from which we can learn in these crazy times.

Ultimately, counties need to think long-term. While the current health crisis calls for quick action, decisions must not be implemented haphazardly or recklessly, nor should they create problems for the future.

As much as we would like to snap our fingers and make all the problems that have emerged from COVID-19 disappear overnight, that is unlikely to happen. When it comes to the best way in which we should deal with the jail population during this time, we must implement reasoned, workable solutions that address the situation in a way that meets the needs of inmates while also ensuring public safety.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The Crisis</h4>
The COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that insufficient resources exist to combat the likely tidal wave of hospital admissions will force unprecedented decisions to be made in Canada. This article recommends bioethical and legal guidelines intended to assist those responsible for the allocation of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. Whether or not to admit a patient to the ICU and initiate mechanical ventilation is a life or death decision and a responsibility that must be met with thought and care.
<h4>The Bioethical Guidelines</h4>
The first step is to decide whether mechanical ventilation is medically indicated. Even before a patient takes a downward turn necessitating ICU admission and ventilation, however, a list of patients suitable for ICU admission should be prepared using objective criteria and a system that awards points on a scale of one to nine, to minimize the prospect of a tie between patients.

A list of suggested factors that might inform the criteria includes: patient wishes; the patient’s advance care directives; the patient’s instructions regarding medical assistance in dying; whether the patient has elevated co-morbid conditions, such as class IV heart failure, severe chronic lung disease, end-stage renal disease, severe cognitive impairment, the impairment of other organs and systems and their reversibility; the severity of the disease; the functional status of the patient; whether the patient has essential responsibilities to saving lives of others; and, whether the patient performs tasks vital or essential to the health or welfare of society.

When a patient is chosen for ventilation, the patient must be informed that the treatment is on a time-limited trial basis, subject to re-evaluation after a reasonable period, to assess whether or not there is a benefit to continuing the treatment. This sets appropriate expectations and permits the withdrawal of the ventilator when further treatment would be futile.

An independent Bioethics Committee of at least three individuals should make the rounds, investigate the background and condition of each patient, and have the specific responsibility of making these very difficult triage decisions.

Physicians and nurses must not make these decisions, as their role is to “do no harm” to their patients. Their role must remain as fiduciary advocates, who speak on behalf of their patients who cannot speak for themselves.

Questionable criteria that are not recommended for inclusion in the criteria are: “first come, first served” access to the ICU; greatest life expectancy; wealth; age; race; color; sex; religion; physical or mental disability, ancestry; place of origin; gender orientation or identity or expression; marital or family status; profession; celebrity status; and, social connections or social status. Perhaps even more problematic are criteria designed to automatically and arbitrarily exclude certain classes of patients from the ICU, such as: criminal history; severe illegal drug addiction; mental health diagnosis; legal or illegal status in the country; is over the age of 65; and ability to pay for health care if uninsured.
<h4>Legal Considerations</h4>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every human being in Canada is entitled to life, liberty and security of the person. Everyone has a constitutional guarantee to the sanctity of their life. The concept of psychological and bodily integrity is included within the concept of security of the person. The right to liberty encompasses the value of personal autonomy to make choices affecting one's health. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every individual human being in Canada is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination. Discrimination on enumerated or analogous grounds is forbidden: race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">These rights are enforceable against government authorities that are subject to the </span><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>. H<span data-preserver-spaces="true">owever, the government may pass a law that is exempt from constitutional scrutiny by invoking the “notwithstanding” clause. Even if this clause is not used, if an individual’s constitutional rights are found by a court to be violated, the law may be saved by another provision of the charter that justifies the infringement of rights and freedoms by reasonable limits prescribed by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Moreover, to date, no laws have been passed that exempt physicians and other first responders from the reach of civil and criminal law that imposes liability for wrongful acts or omissions.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each province and territory has its own jurisdiction to protect the human rights of people. For example, in British Columbia, the </span><a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/00_96210_01">BC Human Rights Code</a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> prohibits, without a </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">bona fide</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and reasonable justification, denying to or discriminating against an individual person or class of individual persons in a service or facility customarily available to the public because of the race, color, ancestry, place of origin, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age of that person or class of persons. Similar provisions exist in human rights legislation in force throughout Canada.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While healthcare workers, administrators and other decision-makers may desire legal immunity to insulate themselves from liability, civil and criminal laws exist to meet all circumstances so that no one can place themselves above the law. Abandoning the rule of law to justify human behavior in exigent circumstances would prove that the law is not worth the paper it is written on and would bring the entire justice system into disrepute. Necessity can never be a defense to murder, outside of the very narrow exception of self-defense. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Healthcare providers and individuals in public health risk criminal liability unless there are statutory provisions granting immunity. Otherwise, criminal negligence may be an appropriate charge where planners have failed to act prudently and reasonably, and instead have arguably acted recklessly by not ensuring sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment and medical resources such as ventilators, hospital beds, test kits, lab facilities, and medication that are in short supply today. </span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Giving healthcare workers and the public incorrect information about the asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 and the benefits of using a face-mask is just one example of how lives can be lost. While the motive may have been to preserve the scant supply of medical-grade masks for healthcare workers and first responders or to promote a false sense of security, the incorrect guidance given to the public and the government about the need to wear masks enabled the exponential growth of the pandemic.</span>

<span></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unconditional access to a ventilator followed by withdrawal of that support in favor of benefiting another patient may also result in a charge of criminal homicide, ranging from manslaughter to murder, depending on the underlying facts. Criminal liability is established by both an act, such as the actual removal or agreement to remove a ventilator, and knowledge of the nature and consequences of that action, such as knowledge that removal of a ventilator will shorten the life of a terminally ill patient. It is comparable to a dilemma faced by physicians who know that by removing the lifeline for one patient, that patient’s life will be sacrificed for the benefit of another patient who may or may not live longer. If both of these patient’s lives are presumed to be equal before the law, criminal liability will be imposed.</span>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Civil liability is another serious concern. Denial of a patient’s access to the ICU and the life-saving resource of a ventilator invites lawsuits against hospitals and triage decision-makers. Denial of an available resource that may have saved the life of a loved one may be found by a court to be a harmful departure from the standard of care required of healthcare providers. The court will need to decide if the patient would have survived but for the denial of the needed medical treatment. This “causation” test is not always possible to meet. It is impossible to know in advance how a lawsuit will go and whether liability will be imposed This results in added stress and uncertainty for healthcare workers already suffering from emotional and psychological trauma from unavoidable “battlefield” triage situations that were not designed for a pandemic of this nature. </span>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
The legal considerations strongly weigh in favor of a set of objective national bioethical criteria that removes decision-making and accusations of “playing God” from physicians, nurses and other patient advocates. The challenge is to quickly assemble independent teams of "Bioethics Committees" that will collectively implement the objective criteria that are encouraged to be adopted by physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators. Time is of the essence as this pandemic is accelerating at an exponential pace. It is time to be proactive and to anticipate what will be needed in the near future. The past pattern of reactive responses, with rare exceptions, has resulted in appalling mismanagement at the cost of human lives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the saying goes, “history repeats itself.” In 2002, the SARS epidemic spread from the Guangdong province of China and affected 29 nation-states by the year 2003. There were 774 human casualties from the disease. The world realized this loss of human life could have been avoided had China not suppressed vital public health information for several weeks. This ill-fated event led the World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states to adopt the<a href="https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/"> International Health Regulations</a> (IHR) in 2005.

Worldwide a total of 1,310,205 people have been infected with and 72,578 have died from COVID-19, and the numbers are rising exponentially. Doctors and other healthcare providers, sanitation workers, and police personnel have been racing against the time to save thousands of lives. It is claimed that China knowingly and deliberately failed to adhere to the IHR in preventing the spread of this novel coronavirus. This article will examine the possibility of holding China accountable for its acts and omissions in an international tribunal. It will investigate whether China violated the rules of the IHR, whether it can be held responsible under general international law and whether paying reparations to countries that have suffered an enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic slowdown is a viable remedy.
<h4>Jurisdictional Challenges of International Adjudication</h4>
Generally, international dispute adjudication is a consent-based process. This is the primary challenge of international dispute adjudication. The parties must agree for their dispute to be submitted to and adjudicated by an international tribunal. Consent may be given in a treaty or by concluding an agreement

Article 75 of the <a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/bd/PDF/bd47/EN/constitution-en.pdf?ua=1">WHO Constitution</a> refers to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for the settlement of disputes. It provides that any question or dispute relating to interpretation and application of the Constitution shall be referred to the ICJ if the same is not settled by negotiation or by the Health Assembly. The ICJ has <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/126">held</a> that it is empowered to deal with any question or dispute relating to interpretation and application of the WHO Constitution. Thus, any dispute concerning interpretation and application of the instrument can be settled by the ICJ.

Recently, the ICJ gave an alternative <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/166">interpretation</a> of the preconditions that must be fulfilled for it to exercise jurisdiction. Namely, fulfilling either the negotiation or the World Health Assembly condition would trigger the court's jurisdiction. If we interpret Article 75 of the WHO Constitution as the ICJ recently did, a failed attempt at negotiation could trigger ICJ jurisdiction.
<h4>Violation of the International Health Regulations and Claims under the WHO Constitution</h4>
A State is obliged under article 5 of the IHR to develop, strengthen, and maintain its public health infrastructure and aid in detecting, monitoring and reporting the events of a potential global health crises. Article 6 covers public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC). In the event of a PHEIC, a state must communicate all public health-related information and events taking place within its territory to the WHO within 24 hours of the assessment. A state must keep the WHO informed with accurate and detailed public health information, including the source of the risk and the nature of the threat it poses, the number of cases and deaths, and any measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Article 7 imposes an obligation upon states to share public health information with the WHO even when the origin or the source of a disease is unknown to a state.

A novel influenza-like illness was found in the body of workers and customers at Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in mid-December 2019. On December 30, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, at the Wuhan Central Hospital, revealed the information online. Although Wuhan public health authorities solicited information about the spreading of a “pneumonia of unclear cause”, it suppressed Li Wenliang’s alarm about the novel disease. Many medical professionals and journalists who tried to disclose information about COVID-19 were silenced and detained by the Chinese authorities. On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission wrongly claimed that there is no human to human transmission of COVID-19.

Furthermore, the Commission described it as seasonal flu which is preventable and controllable. China waited to February 14, 2020, to disclose that around 1700 healthcare workers had been found to be positive for COVID-19. It is more than apparent that the Chinese government suppressed and withheld important public health information for almost two months. As such, one  may conclude that China intentionally as well as deliberately failed to communicate information to WHO as is required in the event of a PHEIC.

According to article 37 of the WHO Constitution, the Director-General of the WHO shall be independent and impartial while exercising powers and functions. In order to remain independent and impartial, they shall not seek or receive instructions from any government or from any external authority. Member states are obliged to respect the international character of the Director-General including WHO staff and must not to influence them. An affected state could make a potential claim that China deliberately tried to influence the Director-General of the WHO and WHO staff by allegedly withholding information, providing inaccurate or false information, and by not providing information at the crucial time.
<h4><strong>Draft Articles on State Responsibility and the Accountability of China</strong></h4>
It appears that China's conduct was wrongful and in violation of international law. If this is the case, then what kind of remedies are available to states harmed by the breach?

The <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf">Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts</a>  was adopted by the International Law Commission at its 53<sup>rd</sup> session in 200,1 and submitted to the UN General Assembly. Although the Draft Articles is not legally binding on states, the document is authoritative and has persuasive value. The ICJ often takes recourse to the Draft Articles in interpreting international law and solving disputes between states, so much so that its provisions have attained the status of customary international law. Article 1 says every internationally wrongful act of a state entails international responsibility of that state. Under Article 2, the wrongful acts are those actions or omissions which constitute a breach of international obligations required under international law. Responsibility emanates from the local Wuhan authorities to the Chinese central government which are all organs of the Chinese state and their alleged wrongful conduct can be attributable to China. China’s alleged willful and intentional failure to share information expeditiously with the WHO in the event of PHEIC in accordance with IHR constitutes breach of international obligations under article 12 of the Draft Articles. China could even be found to be in violation of Article 14 for the continuing breach of its obligation. A study at the University of Southampton revealed that timely intervention one, two, or three weeks earlier in the crisis could have reduced the cases by 66 percent, 86 percent, and 95 percent respectively. Thus, had China intervened responsibly and in a timely fashion, the number of people affected could have been reduced. The state is under obligation to make full reparations for both material and moral injury caused by its wrongful acts under article 31.

The ICJ in the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/case/1">Corfu Chanel case</a> held that no state may knowingly allow its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of the other states. Simply speaking, China allowed activities to take place within its territory that harmed other states. Reparations should be in the form of restitution, compensation, satisfaction, and even in the form of assurance of non-repetition of the wrongful acts. Restitution as a form of reparation means, the state is responsible to re-establish the situation which existed prior to the commission of the wrongful act. If restitution is not possible or not a suitable form of reparation in a particular case, the injured state should be entitled to compensation, which will cover financially assessable damage. If both types of reparation fail to make good, the wrongful state should make good in the form of satisfaction, which may consist of an acknowledgement of breach, an expression of regret, or a formal apology.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Taking a State to the ICJ or any other international tribunal is a herculean. It is highly unlikely that China would submit the dispute to an international forum. The challenge is all the more painstaking when the perpetrator-state is powerful and militarily and diplomatically influential. One must not forget that China holds permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which enables China to invoke veto power. Even if China agrees to the ICJ’s jurisdiction and the court finds China responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak, there would still be a question as the enforcement of the judgment. The UN Security Council as a custodian of world peace plays a vital role in implementing the ICJ’s decisions. Article 94 provides that in case of failure or non fulfilment of the obligation under the judgment, any party may seek recourse in UN Security Council and the Council will take necessary to enforce the judgment. But, as a P5 member, China has the power to block any action that the UN Security Council might take to give effect to an ICJ judgment. Another less vigorous way to hold China responsible is resorting to advisory jurisdiction of the ICJ. Invoking the advisory jurisdiction of the ICJ does not need consent from the disputant parties. Under Article 96 of the UN Charter, the UN General Assembly, Security Council, or other organs of the UN may be authorized to seek advisory opinions of the ICJ on any legal question. The problem with an advisory opinion from the ICJ, however, is that it lacks binding authority. Thus, it leaves enforcement to good faith.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

<a style="cursor: help" title="Per the World Health Organization, common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose, etc. COVID-19 mainly spreads through the sneezing of an infected person or droplets of saliva.">Coronavirus (COVID-19)</a> is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a newly discovered form of Coronavirus. There is currently no vaccine or any other medicine discovered for the <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">treatment</a> of COVID-19. The first case of COVID-19 was <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/first-covid-19-case-can-be-traced-back-to-november-2017-in-chinas-hubei-province-report/articleshow/74608199.cms?from=mdr">identified</a> in China during November, 2019. COVID-19 has now spread across more than 200 countries affecting more than 1,400,000 people and killing more than 85,000. People across the globe have criticized China for its non-transparency and delay in making the disease public. COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the lives of the people and the economy of many countries across the globe. This Paper is an attempt to dig deeper into the question of whether China has violated any obligations under international law and can China be asked to compensate the countries which have been affected by the pandemic.

<strong>China’s Response to the Outbreak of COVID-19</strong>

The first case of COVID-19 happened in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province of China on November, 17, 2019. Since then one to five cases came up every day and by December 31, 2019, the numbers cases went up to 266 in Hubei province, but lockdown wasn't imposed until January 23, 2020. A doctor named Li Wenliang was the first person to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30382-2/fulltext">warn</a> his fellow doctors on group chat about a possible outbreak of an illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Wuhan. Following this, Dr. Wenliang was summoned by the local police and made to sign a statement accusing him of making false statements that disturbed the public order. Subsequently, Dr. Wenliang was diagnosed with COVID-19 on January 30, 2020 and subsequently, succumbed to it. He had posted about his own case of infection with COVID-19 on a social media platform called Weibo. People across China were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51409801">engulfed</a> with rage and anger when they learned about the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. The hashtags of “Wuhan government owes Dr. Wenliang an apology” and “we want freedom of speech” were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51403795">trending</a> on the social media websites of China for many subsequent days. Despite the fact that there were 266 case by late December 2019, the Chinese government censored social media posts indicating plausibility of an outbreak of a SARS-like disease. Rather than taking any serious measures or even recognizing the imminent threat to the health of the people, the government allowed the people to celebrate lunar new year and denied evidence of any community transmission of the disease.

<strong>China’s Obligations under Public International Law</strong>

The only binding legal regulation which addresses the prevention, protection and control of the international spread of disease is the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1031116/retrieve">International Health Regulations</a>, 2005. According to Article 6 of the International Health Regulations, a State has to assess events occurring in its territory and if there is a possibility of the events constituting a public health emergency, they must notify WHO about it within 24 hours of the assessment. Following this notification, the State has to continuously communicate to the WHO timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to it on the event. Also, according to Article 7 of the International Health Regulations, if a State Party has evidence of an unexpected or unusual public health event within its territory, irrespective of origin or source, which may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, it shall provide to the WHO all relevant public health information in accordance with Article 6.

By the end of December 2019, there were more than 250 cases of corona virus in Wuhan province of China and there was a warning from a doctor that it seemed to be a SARS like disease. These were serious events which deserved to be assessed by China in accordance with Article 6 of the International Health Regulations and China was under an obligation to report it as soon as possible to the WHO. On 31st December 2019, China notified the WHO about several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, but said that there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission and only <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/10/21124881/coronavirus-outbreak-china-li-wenliang-world-health-organization">suggested</a> that this was spreading from animals to humans. This information cannot be true because according to the reports by this time more than one-third of the patients had no history of visiting the Wuhan food market. Apart from not reporting correct and sufficient information to the WHO, China also rejected repeated offers from the WHO for epidemic investigation assistance until late January. On top of that China was not <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/china-is-legally-responsible-for-covid-19-damage-and-claims-could-be-in-the-trillions/">sending</a> details that were expected and needed by WHO officials. According to research, various scholars have argued that if China had taken proactive measures to contain and suppress COVID-19 earlier in December 2019, the number of cases could have been mitigated by up to <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/covid19-made-in-china-pandemic-63531/">95%</a>. These facts show that China has violated Article 6 and 7 of the International Health Regulations, 2005.

<strong>Responsibility of China for its Internationally Wrongful Act</strong>

According to Article 1 of the Draft Articles on <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/9_6_2001.pdf">Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts</a> a breach of international law by an act, omission or combination of both, of State entails its international responsibility. According to Article 2, an act or omission qualifies to be an internationally wrongful act only when that act or omission can be attributable to the State under the international law and constitutes an international obligation of the State. Under the International Health Regulations, 2005, China owed an international obligation under the International Health Regulations, 2005 to report timely, accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information about the events happening in its territory to the WHO. But China failed to perform its obligations and therefore, it is responsible for an international wrongful act.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes, it takes a troll to make a point. It can certainly get people thinking, anyway. Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule’s most recent essays are a case in point.

For better or worse, “originalism,” or the idea that the United States Constitution should be interpreted in light of its meaning when it was ratified, is the alpha and omega of conservative constitutional thought. Liberals rightly lampoon originalism as results-oriented nonsense. But unfortunately, their alternatives are every bit as results-oriented, but without the theoretical window dressing. As the saying goes, “It takes a theory to beat a theory.” And even a bullshit theory is better than no theory at all. The rip-roaring practical success of originalism brooks no argument. These days, even liberals make originalist arguments. They don’t really have a choice.

Enter Vermeule. In his recent <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/common-good-constitutionalism/609037/">essay</a> for <em>The Atlantic</em>, “Beyond Originalism,” Vermeule argues that conservatives should abandon originalism for “common-good constitutionalism,” or an interpretation of the Constitution that requires everyone to respect certain normative values. Essentially, he implied that conservatives should interpret the Constitution to impose Catholic integralism, damn the torpedoes.

Unsurprisingly, everyone was horrified. And for good reason! Liberal scholars complained that Vermeule’s expectation of “respect for the authority of rule and of rulers” was a recipe for fascism. Some even tried to make him a pariah, arguing that he should be ostracized and his ideas should be ignored.

As usual, the commentariat tagged along, dragging Vermeule as a fascist authoritarian. After all, his preferences suck, and lots of prestigious legal scholars insist he’s wrong. Good enough.

But conservatives were just as upset. Sure, Vermeule was asking for what they wanted. But for the wrong reasons! Originalism says the Constitution requires conservative values. Vermeule says the Constitution is a blank slate, and conservatives should make it their own. Sometimes, the curtain is a welcome distraction from the truth.

Many might call Vermeule an iconoclast who thrives on shocking the conscience of the academic consensus with his attacks on its most cherished social norms. Or rather, in the vernacular, he’s a troll. As Rick Hills has <a href="https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2018/05/adrian-vermeles-anti-liberal-chic.html">observed</a>, Vermeule uses “anti-liberal chic” to mock the pieties of the liberal elite. Free speech, individual liberty, and personal choice are sacrosanct to the liberal concept of democracy. Vermeule simply observes that most people don’t give a damn about any of those things. Sure, egghead law professors and sanctimonious politicians claim that democracy means liberalism. But in reality, democracy just means majority rule, and the majority isn’t all that liberal.

Vermeule’s critics rightly observe that his work is literally an apologia for totalitarian dictatorship. Surely, he would cheerfully agree. His point is that they cannot offer a compelling alternative.

Neither liberalism nor conservatism offers a constitutional theory that can provide a reliable bulwark against authoritarian misrule. Despite their epicycles of representation reinforcement and historical exegesis, at the end of the day, they boil down to mob rule. Constitutionalism is just the ideological hand-waving that convinces the mob it can’t always get what it wants.

Both Vermeule and his critics are wrong. We are no fans of authoritarian regimes -- our families fled persecution, destitution, and bloodshed -- but ideology can’t solve ideological problems. No constitutional theory can realize constitutional values: not originalism, living constitutionalism, progressivism, or conservatism. And more to the point, no constitution can prevent totalitarianism, if people want it.

Phony legalism is no defense. When totalitarianism comes, it takes a familiar form, and expresses familiar values, in familiar terms. After all, Francoist Spain, Republican France, and Mussolini’s Italy all clothed themselves in the false flag of legalism. As Erwin Chemerinsky observed in <em>We the People: A Progressive Reading of the Constitution for the Twenty-First Century</em>, the Soviet Constitution even promised rights and privileges the NKVD just ignored.

How can we prevent totalitarianism? Who knows. But it might help if we became less ideological and more practical. It isn’t easy. As Jordan L. Perkins has <a href="https://www.jordanlperkins.com/post/on-the-necessity-of-a-common-good-or-against-originalism">observed</a>, “human conflicts are irreducibly bound up with fundamental moral values.” Still, we can choose which values to emphasize.

Maybe one of those values is compromise. We delegate constitutional questions to the Supreme Court because we want to believe that constitutional values are universal and absolute. But maybe we should just admit that the truth is closer to “different strokes for different folks.”

As legal realists have long observed for the benefit of anyone listening, constitutional law is just politics by other means. Maybe we should just leave political questions to political institutions. To paraphrase Eric Segall, the Supreme Court should butt out already and leave politics to legislators.

Ultimately, the only tonic for totalitarianism is a healthy, pluralistic political sphere. Striking a balance among political, moral, and legal ideologies -- not clinging to a blinkered vision of an acutely legalized Constitution -- is the only way we can avoid catastrophe. Only when political leaders and the governed alike can accept pluralism will our nation and legal system have fortified themselves against the risk of misrule.

Beyond the banal “anti-liberal chic” of Adrian Vermeule’s iconoclasm -- which includes some rather distasteful <a href="https://thejosias.com/2018/05/09/liberalisms-fear/">speeches</a> at the consulate of a nation known for <a href="https://amnesty.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Final-prosecution-of-protesters-English-version.pdf">jailing</a> journalists and dissidents -- and the predictable unconvincing rebuttals praising the anti-authoritarian nature of their preferred vision of the Constitution (like Randy Barnett’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/dangers-any-non-originalist-approach-constitution/609382/">piece</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em>) lies the more fundamental problem. Our Constitution is unmoored from political, legal, and ethical public policy rationales. As we have written before, the organizational principle of our politics is flawed. Only by fixing the flaws that exist beyond our acutely legalized and historically unmoored Constitution can we come back to a more functional political and public life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em><strong>*Editor's Note: The title as written is not ungrammatical, but rather refers to an internet meme you can read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">here</a>.</strong></em></blockquote>
Apparently, quarantine means never having to say you’re sorry. All of a sudden, people are coming out with hot takes you never would have expected. Except you did all along.

For example, a remarkable number of people apparently think libraries are bad, because they provide information for free, rather than forcing people to pay. In response to the Covid-19 crisis, the Internet Archive created the <a href="https://archive.org/details/nationalemergencylibrary">National Emergency Library</a>, a repository of e-books that people can check out virtually, rather than visiting a library and checking out a book in person.

Most people were delighted by this creative and selfless effort of a charity to make books available to people who rely on libraries. After all, not everyone can afford to just buy everything they want to read on Amazon. While an e-book is no substitute for the real thing, something is better than nothing, and a lot of people trapped at home could benefit from increased access to reading material.

But publishers didn’t see it that way. On the contrary, they freaked out, and encouraged their allies to do the same. Among other things, the Authors Guild and its members took to Twitter to complain that the Internet Archive was essentially stealing their paycheck, by enabling people to read books for free, rather than paying for them.

As I’ve <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/04/brian-frye-copyright-profits/">previously argued</a>, their complaint is pure landlordism. Authors - or rather, publishers - want to collect their rents and are mad that some people might not pay. Ironically, they don’t even identify any actual lost sales, just the potential.

And yet, the most depressing thing about the complaint is that it’s really just a criticism of libraries. After all, libraries literally exist for the purpose of enabling people to consume information without paying for it. After all, information is a non-rival good. No matter how much of it you consume, the same amount remains. Hell, you might even produce more, as a by-product.

Mike Masnick of TechDirt <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111230/07161417236/if-libraries-didnt-exist-would-publishers-be-trying-to-kill-book-lending.shtml">recently observed</a> that if libraries didn’t already exist, publishers would never allow their creation. The Authors Guild’s objections to the National Emergency Library are a warmed-over version of the same complaint.

Of course, as Masnick <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200330/18125844202/publishers-authors-misguided-freakout-over-internet-archives-decision-to-enable-more-digital-book-checkouts-during-pandemic.shtml">also observed</a>, the complaints about the National Emergency Library are also totally meritless, as it is perfectly legal. But I recently came across a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WRiSZSuy90iK_LcjEJWi82lqthfxOVGQ/view?usp=drivesdk">letter</a> that Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive sent to Senator Thom Tillis, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, reflecting on the purpose of the National Emergency Library, which makes the point even more directly and poignantly. I recommend it.

I will go out on a limb and say that I think libraries are a good thing, in plaguetime and always. When you find yourself complaining about libraries, you might want to think twice about your priorities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"At the beginning of the pestilence and when it ends, there's always a propensity for rhetoric....It is only in the thick of a calamity that one gets hardened to the truth, to silence."
- Albert Camus, <em>The Plague</em></blockquote>
Trump presidential debilities are more serious than simple policy missteps or errors. This administration is far more worrisome than one merely misdirected or problematic. In essence, it has nurtured and sustained a genuinely existential crisis, not just a crisis of meaning, but also one of collective survival. An especially evident component of this literally unprecedented crisis is this president's <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/04/louis-rene-beres-beyond-the-mueller-report/">grievous assaults</a> on law and justice.

All things considered, the Trump presidency is not "merely" ridden with expansive nepotism and corruption (son-in-law Jared Kushner is not America's most obvious best choice for solving the Middle East and Corona virus crises simultaneously). It now <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2017/08/louis-rene-beres-trump-nuclear/">endangers</a> our actual physical continuance as a people and as a nation. From the beginning, of course, we had ample good <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2016/08/what-if-you-dont-trust-the-judgment-of-the-president-whose-finger-is-over-the-nuclear-button/">cause to worry</a> about making this anti-intellectual president the ultimate custodian of American <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2017/08/president-trump-nuclear-war/">nuclear weapons</a> authority. Now we need also concern ourselves with biology in its most destructive pathogenic manifestations; that is, with a present day plague that can never be countered by Donald Trump's shallow reasoning, empty witticisms or gratuitously belligerent rhetoric.

The corona virus horror will not disappear "miraculously," as was once claimed by Mr. Trump. It will never yield to any clownish impresario's conspicuously tawdry and transparent <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, reminds Sigmund Freud: 'Fools, visionaries, sufferers from delusions, neurotics and lunatics have played great roles at all times in the history of mankind, and not merely when the accident of birth had bequeathed them sovereignty. Usually, they have wreaked havoc.'">sleight of hand</a>. Rather, under the most optimistic assumptions, it will submit only to an optimal fusion of science, medicine and law. Whether this indispensable fusion can even be identified in time still remains an open question. "The worst," says Swiss playwright Friedrich Durrenmatt, "does sometimes happen."

America needs to stay focused on what is truly important. Apropos of this obligation, there is no longer any point to identifying this disjointed president's multiple errors and derelictions just one at a time or serially. The underlying problem here is utterly holistic. Donald Trump's analytic and moral shortcomings are integral to the man; they are not in any way remediable. Far-reaching and <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, one must recall Donald Trump's core philosophy of belligerent nationalism, an 'America First' dogma fundamentally contrary to the basic principles of international law. International law is an integral part of the legal system of all states in world politics, and assumes a reciprocally common obligation of states to supply benefits to one another. This assumption of jurisprudential solidarity is known formally as a 'peremptory' or jus cogens expectation, that is, one that is never subject to question or reversal. It can be discovered early in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis, Hugo Grotius, The Law of War and Peace (1625) and Emmerich de Vattel, The Law of Nations or Principles of Natural Law (1758).'">once-unimaginable</a>, these debilities are a <em>fait accompli</em>; they must be dealt with accordingly.
<blockquote>“The mass-man,” as we were earlier warned by Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y’ Gasset in <em>The Revolt of the Masses</em> (1930) “has no attention to spare for reasoning; he learns only in his own flesh.”</blockquote>
This is exactly how President Trump "learns." When asked on April 10, 2020 how he would create metrics for determining when the country could be safely "opened up again," he pointed to his head, and exclaimed: "This is my only metric." Always, this crudely primal method of understanding represents his seat-of-the-pants reasoning, inane calculations exercised by raw instinct and then revealed with a demeaning frivolity.

When meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong-Un in 2018, Trump dismissed all usual presidential leadership obligations to study and prepare. Instead, he <a style="cursor: help" title="See President Donald Trump's quoted statement on June 11, 2018.">emphasized</a>, again and again, offhandedly: "I don't think I have to prepare very much. It's all about attitude."

Indifferent to law at every level, domestic and international, Donald Trump remains the uncontested champion of contrived anti-reason and deliberate falsehood. Though most Americans might fairly resist any too-candid comparisons of Trump's leadership characteristics with available examples from the Third Reich, there are certain markedly plausible points of commonality. They ought not be dismissed out of hand.

"Intellect rots the brain," shrieked Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels at a Nuremberg rally in 1935. "I love the poorly educated" intoned Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign for the presidency. Inter alia, what these assertions have in common is a potentially tragic disdain for science and education. They also point to a mutually deformed and twisted national ideal, one that favors viscerally mindless public obedience to anti-legal commands from the White House. An obvious example is this president's conspicuous manipulation of his Attorney General and Department of Justice for narrow political benefit.

To be sure, the robotic Trump minions are generally undisturbed by their master's open indifference to law and justice. For them, documented facts and/or pertinent statutes are banal matters of unconcern. For these citizens, the obedient phrase "I believe" is all that counts. For them, the more nuanced "I think" is either completely unknown or intentionally subordinate.

For the self-parodying faithful caught up in rancorous Trump deflections from genuine issues, independent thought is always anathema. For them, the Cartesian "<a style="cursor: help" title="Cogito ergo sum, 'I think therefore I am.' The exact reference here is to the 'universal doubt' encouraged by René Descartes, Discourse on Method (1637).">cogito</a>" might just as well never have been fashioned.

"Learning only in his own flesh...," US President Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his glaring antipathy for history, learning law and logic. Earlier, he returned from his Singapore summit with Kim Jong-Un declaring that the calculable risks of a bilateral nuclear war had suddenly been removed because he and Kim "had fallen in love." Today, he offers wholly unqualified estimations of assorted drug efficacies against the Corona virus. Simultaneously, he responds to science-based prescriptions with wholly unwarranted expressions of casual doubt or quirky indifference.

For the United States, these incoherent and stream-of-consciousness excursions into gibberish by an American president are far more than simply humiliating. Now, at a fearful time of palpable biological "plague," these unhidden declensions are immediately life-threatening. Jurisprudentially, they come verifiably close to being <a style="cursor: help" title="Professor Beres is the author of several major books and many law journal articles on genocide-like crimes. See, for example, Louis René Beres, 'Genocide and Genocide-Like Crimes,' in M. Cherif Bassiouni., ed., International Criminal Law: Crimes (New York, Transnational Publishers, 1986), pp. 271-279. Although the criminalizing aspect of international law that proscribes genocide-like conduct may derive from a source other than the Genocide Convention (i.e., it may emerge from customary international law and be included in different international conventions), such conduct is clearly a crime under international law. Even where the conduct in question does not affect the interests of more than one state, it becomes an international crime whenever it constitutes an offense against the world community delicto jus gentium.">genocide-like crimes</a>.

A core observation now cries out for attention.<em> How pitifully inadequate are America's legal processes and institutions in dealing with Donald Trump's willfully <a style="cursor: help" title="Most egregious here are recent federal government (FEMA) seizures of medical ventilators for preferable shipment to pro-Trump governors.">chaotic instincts</a></em>. The resultant withering of our declining nation's heart and mind now point unerringly to once-unimaginable existential threats. While the various mega-death scenarios of relentless pandemic are currently most riveting, the more "normal" dangers of nuclear war and <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, terrorist movements are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.' See: Research in International Law: Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime, 29 AM J. INT'L L. (Supp 1935) 435, 566 (quoting King v. Marsh (1615), 3 Bulstr. 27, 81 Eng. Rep 23 (1615)(">terrorism</a> have not magically disappeared. In the expected worst cases, war, terror and pandemic could occur more-or-less simultaneously, and with harshly interactive results that are not simply intersectional, but also <em>synergistic</em>.

There is more. In any scenario of overwhelmingly destructive synergy, the whole of any potential catastrophe would necessarily be greater than the "mere" <a href="https://harvardnsj.org/2015/06/core-synergies-in-israels-strategic-planning-when-the-adversarial-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/">sum of its constituent parts</a>.

At best, there is nothing expressly murderous or genocidal in Donald Trump's policies, whether foreign and domestic, but, unambiguously, there is always a far-reaching indifference to basic legal expectations regarding human rights and welfare.. "All men have my blood and I have all men's," wrote American Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson in "Self-Reliance," but this cosmopolitan <a style="cursor: help" title="We may think also of the corresponding Talmudic observation: 'The earth from which the first man was made was gathered in all the four corners of the world.'">sentiment</a> is plainly alien and incomprehensible to Donald J. Trump. As with other challenging matters of intellectual judgment, this president's near-total lack of empathic feelings reveals a starkly frightful level of personal emptiness. Among other things, they reveal a literally grotesque American leader of breathtaking vapidity.

Where do Americans go from this already-unbearable point of political and jurisprudential departure? Whatever else we might conclude, Donald Trump displays numerous and incontrovertible derangements. Still, rather than continue to approach them as if they were somehow singularly meaningful and correspondingly remediable, all of us must now finally understand that (1) there exists no feasible "fix" for any such complex concatenations of monstrous presidential behavior, and (2) the danger posed by this president is legally overwhelming and "<a style="cursor: help" title="In jurisprudence, this phrase appears as the solitary permissible justification for national acts of 'anticipatory self-defense.' This principle of customary jurisprudence has its modern origins in the so-called Caroline Case, which concerned the unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. Following this landmark case, even the serious threat of an armed attack can sometimes be taken as sufficient justification for defensive military action. In more narrowly technical jurisprudence, the criterion of permissibility revolves around a danger presumed to be 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment or deliberation.' Of course, during the first third of the nineteenth century, there could have been no conceivable thought of forestalling a nuclear aggression.">imminent in point of time</a>."

Clearly, though Trump believes that all that he does is undertaken with an absolute purity of heart, similarly felt convictions were detectable among the 1930s managers of Third Reich propagandist Joseph Goebbels.

Let us be candid. In America today, there is vastly too much "noise." Among those many citizens who so strenuously loathe refined intellect and serious jurisprudential thought, it is a rancorous noise made on behalf of a uniquely destructive <a style="cursor: help" title="In a wholly negative assessment, Twentieth century German writer Thomas Mann would have called Trump a 'magician.' See for example, his classic novella on the rise of Nazism, 'Mario and the Magician.'">political showman</a>.

There are serious lessons to be learned. For all Americans, the most ruinous evasion of all will be to seek palpable comfort and succor in this Trumpian form of coming-together; that is, to seek to escape moral judgment as human beings and private citizens. This search won't work. "In eternity," reminds the 19th century Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, "each shall render account as an <em><a style="cursor: help" title="The Kierkegaardian concept of 'crowd' is roughly analogous to philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's 'herd,' psychologist Carl G. Jung's 'mass,' or Sigmund Freud's 'horde.'">individual</a></em>."

At least there will be this residual sort of "last judgment."

"Monster" is a decent and correct term of judgment for an American president who encourages manifold <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2018/11/louis-beres-khashoggi-murder/">crimes</a> against the United States and <a href="https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/jurist-us-abandons-legal-obligations-syria">other nations</a>. Even without <em>mens rea</em>, or what the jurists would call "criminal intent," Trump's vaguely casual unconcern for science-based judgments on disease, <a style="cursor: help" title="One must remember here that pertinent obligations of international law are also generally obligations of US law. In the precise words of Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the judgment of the US Supreme Court in Paquete Habana (1900): 'International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction....' (175 U.S. 677(1900)) See also: Opinion in Tel-Oren vs. Libyan Arab Republic (726 F. 2d 774 (1984)). Moreover, the specific incorporation of treaty law into US municipal law is expressly codified at Art. 6 of the US Constitution, the so-called 'Supremacy Clause.'">law</a> and war could result in the death of millions. In effect, such presidential unconcern exhibits a uniquely hideous species of "vice," a species so inherently riveting that it defies any more "measured," "balanced," or "objective" sorts of description.

An overriding obligation arises, both legal and intellectual. We must ask promptly: <em>What has been happening?</em> For a tentative answer, we may consult Alexander Pope's "Essay on Man:" "Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As to be hated needs but to be seen; Yet, seen too often, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace."

The current American presidency is assuredly not the first to flout or disregard considerations of law and justice, but it is unequivocally the most egregious. At first, Donald J. Trump was viewed as a merely <a style="cursor: help" title="'The man who laughs,' says playwright Bertolt Brecht, 'has simply not yet heard the terrible news.'">humorous</a> and eccentric candidate, but certainly not one to be taken too seriously. Over time, however, despite multiple successive <a style="cursor: help" title="These infringements include assorted incorporated violations of human rights law. To wit, Article 6 of the US Constitution clarifies, inter alia, that '...all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land....' The United States is a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which contains (at Article 33) the basic principle of non-refoulement: 'No Contracting State shall expel or return ('refouler') a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion.'">infringements</a> of law and justice following his entry into the White House, Trump has revealed that our most unambiguously sacred legal and political institutions are largely impotent in the face of a monstrous fool or would-be tyrant. With this sobering revelation, Americans must now ask of themselves a previously unimaginable question: "Can we even survive a president who places greater value on vainglorious personal attention than on national welfare and national survival?"

The answer is by no means self-evident.

		<title>Trump’s Tears Against Inspectors General Tell Us It’s Time to Abandon the Unitary Executive Theory</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump has been on a recent tear against independent inspectors general (IGs). In just the last couple weeks, he has taken significant swipes at the independence of IGs charged with oversight and investigation into federal coronavirus relief, hospital preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic, and activities of the intelligence community. And he’s done this in the name of his claimed plenary authority to supervise and control anything and everything that happens within the Executive Branch. In other words, he’s done this in the name of the “unitary executive theory.”

But President Trump’s actions don’t validate the unitary executive theory. To the contrary: they illustrate its limits, and, ultimately, why it’s just plain wrong. President Trump’s tear against the independence of the IGs show why it’s time to abandon this constitutional fiction.

President Trump’s tears started with his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-38/">signing statement</a> on the coronavirus aid and relief package that Congress passed late last month. In his statement, the President argued that Congress could not require the Chair of the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to consult with Congress regarding the selection of top officials for the newly created Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, designed to oversee the new federal aid and relief program. He also argued that he could control any report that the new Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery might submit to Congress — contrary to the law. In support of his sweeping claims, he cited the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Vesting Clause</a> and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Take Care Clause</a> of Article II — the textual nucleus of the unitary executive theory.

Next, President Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community, based on Atkinson’s role in the President’s impeachment. Recall that Atkinson received a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/09/whistleblower-complaint-publicly-released-for-trump-ukraine-phone-call/">whistleblower complaint</a> about President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Pursuant to the IGIC statute, Atkinson forwarded the complaint to the acting director of national intelligence, who was supposed to forward it to Congress. (The acting DNI derailed this process, however, and did not immediately send the report to Congress.) In firing Atkinson, the President explained only that he lacked the “fullest confidence” in Atkinson. The President cited no wrongdoing. As authority for the termination, the President referenced only his “power as President” and his “power of appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.” And while the letter didn’t specifically cite the unitary executive theory, that’s exactly what the President was invoking.

Then, President Trump took aim at the IG for the Department of Health and Human Services. The IG issued a <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-20-00300.pdf">report</a> that hospitals were short on vital supplies and equipment to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. The report also concluded that hospitals couldn’t count on shipments from the federal strategic stockpile. The President blasted the report as “just plain wrong,” and criticized the IG as a partisan hold-over from the Obama Administration. In doing so, he adhered yet again to the unitary executive theory.

Finally, and most recently, President Trump removed Glenn Fine as the acting IG at the Department of Defense. President Trump said that he had authority as President to remove Fine, and that the move was part of a broader effort to purge his administration of partisan hold-overs from the Obama Administration. (Fine is a career official who has served both Democrat and Republican administrations.) Fine also served as Chair of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, the oversight body created by the coronavirus aid and relief package. Fine’s removal as acting IG also meant that he could no longer serve as Chair of that oversight committee. (But as I mentioned above, President Trump already kneecapped the IG in his signing statement on the coronavirus aid bill.) Yet again, the President’s action falls squarely within executive authority as envisioned by the unitary executive theory.

These moves are deeply troubling for anyone who cares about democratic oversight and accountability. But at the same time, the President’s behavior is really only the natural extension of a decades-long effort to entrench the unitary executive theory in our understanding of the Constitution. This effort draws heavily on Justice Scalia’s lone dissent in <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/487/654">Morrison v. Olson</a></span> (1988), the case involving the old Office of Independent Counsel, which Congress created to investigate alleged wrongdoing in the administration. As part of the independent counsel law, Congress insulated the office from the political whims of the administration, to make it, well, independent. It did this by limiting the Attorney General’s authority (and therefore the President’s authority) to fire independent counsel only “for cause” (and not at will). The Court ruled that this partial restriction on the President’s power to terminate an official did not impermissibly encroach on the President’s executive power.

Justice Scalia dissented. Writing only for himself, Justice Scalia argued that Article II gave the President, and the President alone, unilateral and plenary executive authority. He asserted that this authority included the power to control executive officials and to fire them at will. According to Justice Scalia, even the modest for-cause termination requirement in the independent counsel statute impermissibly restricted this unilateral and plenary power—the power of the unitary executive.

While the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5a/compiledact-95-452">IG statutes</a> do not contain a “for cause” removal restriction, they nevertheless ensure independence in different ways. For example, they specify that IGs should be appointed without regard to politics. They authorize IGs to engage in investigations and to issue reports about problems and deficiencies in the agencies they serve, free of political interference. And they specify that the IGs must report certain problems to Congress, even if the IGs are supervised day-to-day within the Executive Branch.

President Trump’s attacks on the IGs threaten to destroy this different kind of independence. In so doing, they put on full display, and reveal the natural extension of, Justice Scalia’s unitary executive theory in his dissent in <em>Morrison</em>—that the President must control (and therefore can politicize) <em>everything</em> within the Executive Branch.

But at the same time, President Trump’s attacks show why the unitary executive theory is wrong. In particular, President Trump’s muscular version of the unitary executive theory tramples Congress’s own robust powers. These include the power to create the administrative bureaucracy and its various offices in the first place; the power to authorize its departments and officers to enforce the law; the power to appropriate funding for the administrative bureaucracy; and, perhaps most relevant here, the power to oversee, investigate, and publicize the actions and behavior within the Executive Branch. By attacking the IGs, President Trump impermissibly encroaches on each of these congressional authorities.

President Trump’s tears against the IGs reveal the damage that the unitary executive theory can do. They also reveal why the unitary executive theory is wrong. It’s time that we call this “theory” what it is—a constitutional fiction—before this Administration can do more, and lasting, damage to our separation of powers.

		<title>The Killing of General Soleimani – A Blatant Violation of International Laws</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The United States of America rejoiced over the assassination of the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani while the Iranians mourned him as a national hero. The President of The United States has repeatedly <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213096351296299017">shown</a> pride in the United State's murder of the General. The act must receive international condemnation and opprobrium. The US drone strike in January of this year was strongly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/30/tehran-condemns-us-airstrikes-in-iraq-and-syria-as-act-of-terrorism">condemned</a> by the Iranian government and many superpowers of the world. A multi-city funeral was held in Iran and Iraq for both the General’s death and other casualties. This incident was considered an act of aggression by the US and a breach of Iraqi sovereignty. The act instigated negativity towards the Trump administration and the United States' use of lethal weapons. The US government has been unable to explain the killing of General Soleimani. In the past, the US has killed non-state actors it deemed terrorists, like Osama bin Laden. However, the killing of General Qasem Soleimani differs because he was a state actor. Thus, the US violated international laws and Soleimani's killing should be considered murder. The 2020 Baghdad International Strike is a blatant violation of international laws.

<strong>General Qasem Soleimani – A True Veteran</strong>

Qasem Soleimani was considered one of the most powerful Generals of Iran. He was the commander of the Quds force, a unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This division is responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations. He was considered to be the second most powerful man in Iran and the right hand of man to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran. He was the mastermind behind the Russian military intervention in Syria. The People of Iran <a href="https://apnews.com/5597ff0f046a67805cc233d5933a53ed">viewed</a> him as a “selfless hero fighting Iran’s enemies” who protected their beloved nation from international threats. But the US designated him as a terrorist. He was one of the most reputed countrymen of Iran and was presented with the order of Zolfaghar, the country's highest military honor, for his exemplary duty to the nation.

<strong>Legalities</strong>

Article 51 of the UN charter <a href="https://legal.un.org/repertory/art51.shtml">prohibits</a> the use of force against any person except only under the two circumstances:
<ul>
 	<li><span>when the use of force was authorized by the UN Security Council and </span></li>
 	<li><span>When a country acted in self-defense.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>It is clear that the UN Security Council did not authorize the strike. To meet the requirements for self-defense under international law, the US must have acted to avert an imminent attack. But the Article’s ambit of self-defense is only in the response to an attack that has already been done or occurred or is underway. Thus, self-defense is permissible only in response to armed attacks that are imminent. Even the Red Cross <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-4171.pdf">defines</a> self-defense in this way: </span>“The inherent right of a state to use of force in response to an armed attack."

The US' airstrike may have <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2049534/statement-by-the-department-of-defense/">been</a> anticipatory self-defense; However, such self-defense is unlawful. Alleged plotting and planning are not enough to attack a person who was decorated as an official by his country. The Self-defense must be instant, overwhelming and leaving no choice and means, leaving no time for deliberation. This means that states may not use force to pre-emptively halt latent threats of force

Iraqi MPs <a href="http://brazen violation of Iraq’s sovereignty">called</a> the airstrike a "brazen violation of Iraq’s sovereignty" and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/05/iraq-prime-minister-says-parliament-must-end-foreign-troop-presence-as-soon-as-possible.html">passed</a> a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country. In 2008, an agreement was signed between the two countries to deter threats to Iraqi sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity. The agreement expressly prohibited the US from using Iraq as a launching point for attacks on other countries. The Prime Minister of Iraq stated that the US violated the deal. The Iraqis’ believed that the US has put a black spot on their sovereignty.

<strong>The United States' Binoculars</strong>

The US has shown its aggressive nature towards terrorists, particularly of one religion, through its involvement in the Syrian war, as well as The Trump administration refusing visas to many Islamic dominated countries. The War on Terror was launched by the United States government after the 9/11 attack. The prime focus was on the Sunni Islamist fundamentalist armed groups like Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and Tehrik-i-Taliban of Pakistan. It’s more than nineteen years since the War on Terror started.

In the case of killing General Qasem Soleimani, President Donald Trump indicated a potential threat of terrorist activities. He said that US intelligence had expected an imminent and sinister attack by Iraq against the US. The US has a zero-tolerance policy toward potential threats or any kind of terrorist activity.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The United States takes swift action against terrorism and identifies particular groups as terrorists. However, groups like ISIS are not a nation-state. ISIS is a self-proclaimed Caliphate which has no sovereign recognition, no UN membership, and no defined borders. Therefore, ISIS has no international rights, like the ones that give absolute power to the US to protect its boundaries and control terrorism. But Iraq, similar to the US, is a member state of the UN, has defined borders and international recognition, and has rights over any activities occurring in their territories.

The killing of General Soleimani, a top-ranking military official of a nation-state, who enjoyed the full support of the leadership of Iran, is nothing but a crime. The US attack is considered murder under international law. An attack on a general of a country who was the head of the Quds force amounts to a violation of the sovereignty of Iran. The act is clearly an act of war. There is a possibility of World War-III between US-Iran as the tensions among them are increasing day by day. The killing was not justified and the blatant international violation by the US could lead to world destruction if both the countries go on war.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The coronavirus pandemic has created a cascade of horrible effects. As of April 10, there have been half a million cases and 18,000 deaths in the United States (1.5 million cases and over 100,000 deaths worldwide). The pandemic has also created widespread economic hardship, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/09/830216099/6-6-million-more-file-for-unemployment-as-coronavirus-keeps-economy-shut">17 million Americans</a> newly unemployed within the past three weeks. And one further consequence of this all is that many tenants are struggling to stay afloat. Estimates are that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/08/829850505/millions-didnt-pay-rent-last-week-amid-pandemic-woes">one-third of U.S. tenants </a>did not pay April rent.

Tenants and activists have urged legislatures to provide some kind of safety net. And many cities and states have responded, enacting local ordinances that <span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-06/california-courts-coronavirus-urgent-new-rules">put evictions on hold</a></span> or provide other protections. Tenant organizers have also advocated <span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/8/21203754/coronavirus-housing-cancel-rent-strikes">rent strikes</a></span> - coordinated efforts where a group of tenants consciously chooses not to pay rent.

However, some landlords are pushing back - and at least some are peddling the false idea that tenants who engage in rent strikes or fail to pay rent would be subject to imprisonment. This falsehood found a platform in a <span><a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/04/rent-strike-coronavirus-landlord-interview.html">recent article on Slate</a></span> where reporter Rachelle Hampton interviews landlord Clifton Rowls.

The interview is fascinating for several reasons. For one thing, Hampton repeatedly asks whether Rowls would give any leeway to tenants unable to pay their rent, and Rowls doggedly refuses to agree. And then, in a key exchange, Rowls suggests that non-payment could put a tenant in jail. Here is that exchange (emphasis added):
<blockquote><strong><em>Hampton: </em></strong><em>One thing gaining traction is the idea of a rent strike.</em>

<strong><em>Rowls: </em></strong><em>People can do that. And you don’t have to have been fired from your job and I’m positive that there are a lot of people who are going to take advantage of this and then they’ll do it. But they need to remember, they will pay for it sooner or later because once you have just simply refused to pay your rent because of this, it will affect your credit report. There’s no free lunch out here, none. I’ve been around for a very long time. Take my word for it. In the fine print, you do not want your credit destroyed.</em>

<em><u>Not only that, it’s against the law to do it. Why would you risk going to jail? There is no law that I have seen saying that you can just not pay your rent.</u></em><em> That’s like saying, “Go to the grocery store and don’t pay your grocery bill.” And anybody who tries that, they will be affected later on if not right away. I wouldn’t tell anybody to do it.</em></blockquote>
Rowls’s comments are a bit scattered, but it appears he is claiming that either participating in a rent strike or just non-payment of rent generally (probably the latter) is a criminal act that can subject a tenant to jail time. That claim is absolutely false.

This was not always the case. Debtor’s prisons have a <span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/04/13/i-o-u">long and ugly history</a></span> in the United States. Until the mid-1800s, debtors could be and often were sent to prison, facing horrific conditions including rats, smallpox, and starvation. Thankfully, an 1833 federal law banned many debtor’s prisons, while the rest disappeared under state laws and follow-up court decisions. Explicit debtor’s prison is a relic of over a century past.

This does not mean that debt has no connection with prison today. People in poverty have higher rates of incarceration. (As <span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674983960">scholars have discussed</a></span>, this ties to the <span><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237476">racial wealth gap</a></span>.) And <span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/ending-modern-day-debtors-prisons">modern commenters</a></span> have <span><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/02/24/debtors-prisons-then-and-now-faq"> argued</a></span> that aspects of the current carceral system (such as bail, fines, and fees) in fact <span><a href="https://truthout.org/articles/the-shackles-return-why-debtors-prisons-are-making-an-american-comeback/">function</a></span> as a kind of <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/02/debtors-prison/462378/">debtor’s prison</a></span>. But express imprisonment for failure to pay a debt to a landlord is, thankfully, a relic of the far distant past.

Until recently, there was one not-quite-exception in Arkansas. Unlike every other state, <span><a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/16/can-you-go-to-jail-for-not-paying-rent">Arkansas</a></span> has a “criminal eviction” statute. Until 2015, a tenant who failed to pay rent could in fact be charged with a misdemeanor and, in subsequent court proceedings, might eventually be subject to some prison time. This law was <span><a href="http://media.law.uark.edu/arklawnotes/2018/05/08/the-purpose-of-criminal-evictions-applying-the-theories-of-punishment-to-arkansas-criminal-eviction-statute/">criticized </a></span> for many decades; advocates recently brought a lawsuit <span><a href="https://arktimes.com/news/arkansas-reporter/2015/01/15/suffer-the-renters?oid=3618077">challenging its validity</a></span> and in 2015, a court <span><a href="https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/state-of-arkansas-v-artoria-smith-8472/">struck down</a></span> the statute as unconstitutional. In response, the statute was <span><a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Document?type=pdf&amp;source=Amendments&amp;bill=SB25-S1&amp;ddBienniumSession=2017%2F2017R">amended</a></span> in a way which appears to remove the possibility of imprisonment.

Now, this does not mean that landlords have no legal remedies for non-payment. Landlords regularly pursue unlawful detainer (eviction) lawsuits in order to regain possession. Eviction cases are on-hold in many places, but as a general matter they do allow landlords to regain possession of property. Landlords can also seek money judgments (which are subject to the same provisions as any other money judgment).

However, if a landlord tells his tenants that they must pay rent or go to jail, he is lying and misrepresenting the law. Such fraud has no place in public discussion, and especially should not be promoted by publications like Slate. In the United States in 2020, explicit Debtor’s Prison only exists in Dickensian horror stories - and apparently, in the misguided imagination of some D.C. landlords.

		<title>The WTO Appellate Body Crisis: How We Got Here and What Lies Ahead?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Appellate Body is an important element of the Dispute Settlement System of the World Trade Organization (WTO), hearing appeals against the findings of the panel established by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The Appellate Body (AB) ideally consists of seven members including the Chairman. But on 10<sup>th</sup> December 2019, this body went into crisis as two out of its three remaining members’ four-year terms came to an end. In this article, the authors dive into this crisis and try to analyze what led to such an impasse, and what political, economic, or social factors have influenced what is happening now in the dispute settlement mechanism. Also, how much the current administration of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is responsible for this crisis shall be addressed. Further, the authors will consider what steps forward should be taken towards an amicable solution so that the Appellate Body can operate as a functional and fair part of the WTO’s Dispute Settlement System.

<strong>Uncle Sam’s Bayonet Charge: Frontal role of the US in the crisis</strong>

The United States of America and the protectionist agenda-driven regime under President Trump is to blame for the crisis in the Dispute Settlement System (DSS) given the Appellate Body not having an adequate number of members. The United States is blocking the appointment of new members to the Appellate Body (AB).  The <span><a href="https://www.neweurope.eu/article/us-blocks-appointment-of-wto-judges/">US Ambassador to the WTO</a></span> stated that the US does not approve the appointment of new persons to the vacant Appellate Body seats. However, this is not the first time this has happened. The Obama administration, blocked the appointment of <span><a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/wto-judicial-appointments-bad-omen-trading-system">Jennifer Hillman</a></span> for a second term in  2011, claiming the WTO has failed to protect American interests. Again in 2016, the US blocked the reappointment of <span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/united-states-blocks-reappointment-of-wto-appellate-body-member/0F4CD279C8002CDDAA347ED828CFA2C5">Seung Wha Chang</a></span>. Thereafter, in 2018, the Trump administration blocked the reappointment of <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/%20tratop_e/dispu_e/ab_an_rep_e.htm">Shri Baboo Chekitan Servasing</a></span>.

Shockingly, the United States has played such a central role in dismantling the DSS and plunging it into paralysis but simultaneously promotes itself as the primary advocate of the multilateral trading system. The US claims that the Appellate Body functions in a manner that is actively unfair and detrimental to its interests.

<strong>US Objections: What is wrong with the Appellate Body?</strong>

<u>Judicial Activism by the Appellate Body</u>

One of the United States’ main accusations against the Appellate Body is that it has overstepped its jurisdiction time and again, creating law and indulging in “Judicial Activism”. According to the US, the AB is creating new rules, which cannot be done, as the recommendations and rulings “cannot add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in the covered agreements”, as per <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dsu_e.htm">Article 3.2 of the DSU</a></span>.

According to the US, there has been a disregard for the role of the Appellate Body in its approach towards the adjudication of the disputes and have an analysis which is mostly <em>obiter dicta</em>. For example, the US said that in <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds453_e.htm">Argentina – Financial Services</a></span>, AB’s analysis was nothing but <em>obiter dicta. </em>It reversed the findings of the Panel and unnecessarily added to their analysis by clarifying on other provisions of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). According to the United States, the AB cannot behave like academia and deviate from the issues and give different analysis altogether, and that “it is not the role of the panels or the Appellate Body to ‘<span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news16_e/us_statment_dsbmay16_e.pdf">make law</a></span>’ outside of the context of the resolving dispute”. The US has again and again stated that any attempt by AB to fix the lacuna in the WTO agreements violates Article 3.2 of the DSU, which accords the “<span><a href="http://wtochairs.org/sites/default/files/AB%20Article%20%20-%20JWT%20.pdf">exclusive authority to adopt interpretations</a></span>” of Multilateral Trade Agreements to the Ministerial Conference and the General Council.

<u>Problem with precedents</u>

Another problem observed by the US against the Appellate Body is that it creates persuasive precedents. But that is problematic on many levels because having a persuasive value is very different from having a “binding” value, which is not the case in the WTO DSS. The reports adopted are not a binding precedent on subsequent cases in the future, unlike other areas of disputes in international law. If the reasoning of past report is persuasive for the Appellate Body in a present case, the Appellate Body will add it to the DSS to improve <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c7s2p1_e.htm">the security and predictability of the multilateral trading system</a></span> under Article 3.2 of the DSU. Further, the Appellate Body in <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds344_e.htm">US-Stainless Steel (Mexico)</a></span> said that the reports are only binding on the parties between whom the particular dispute is to be resolved. But this does not amount to legal interpretations of such reports being worthless or disregarded by the DSB, as the panels should follow previously adopted AB reports for the “development of a coherent and predictable body of jurisprudence”. However, analysis is only relevant for the cases where the issues are similar. Moreover, it does not create any legal obligation for the DSS to use that interpretation despite its persuasive value. Thus, this common law trend, though visible, does not create much of the concern that the US claims.

<u>Objections to the Working Procedures</u>

During Ministerial Conferences, the US has raised a separate concern about <span><a href="https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S009-DP.aspx?language=E&amp;CatalogueIdList=97216,96778,83411,84099,90164,44904,109031&amp;CurrentCatalogueIdIndex=0&amp;FullTextHash=">Rule 15</a></span> of the Appellate Body Working Procedures. This rule mentions that an Appellate Body member, upon AB’s authorization and with notification to the DSB, may complete disposal of any appeal and for that purpose will be deemed to be a member of the AB. The Working Procedures are drawn up by the AB in consultation with the Director-General of the WTO and the Chairman of the DSB, as per <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dsu_e.htm">Article 3.9</a></span> of the DSU. The objection relates to the point that the members should not take any new cases as there might be a backlog which they would have to clear. This sometimes inevitably leads to the delay in reports more than the stipulated time of 60 days, under <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dsu_e.htm">Article 17.5</a></span>.

<strong>Suggestions</strong>

In the words of <span><a href="http://asiantradecentre.org/talkingtrade/the-titanic-has-hit-the-iceberg-global-trade-in-profound-trouble">Deborah Elms</a></span>, Executive Director at the Asian Trade Centre, ‘Titanic has hit the iceberg and is now slowly sinking.’ Major improvements are required at WTO right away. Keeping in mind the commotion that the Appellate Body has been subjected to it is quite evident now that saving just the Appellate Body would not suffice. It is apposite to save the Dispute Settlement Understanding in its entirety. And to break this impasse, the concerns of the United States must be met so that it can unblock the appointment process of the members of the Appellate Body. Keeping the same in mind, the authors would suggest certain reforms that they believe can help break this Appellate Body impasse. These include:

<strong>To adopt the Walker Principles-</strong> David Walker, New Zealand’s Ambassador to WTO, was <span><a href="wto.org/english/news_e/news19_e/gc_18jan19_e.htm">appointed</a></span> in February 2019 by the General Council Chair as a facilitator and was given the task of improving the functioning of the Appellate Body. The principles that he put forth were designed in such a manner to address all the concerns that the US has with Appellate Body. These include mandating the Appellate Body to make decisions in 90 days, members of the Appellate Body to leave the office at the end of their second term, Appellate Body to address only those issues that have been raised specifically by the parties at dispute and to take panel reports in the account as is necessary and not as precedents. These <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/12/09/new-proposal-seeks-to-save-world-trade-organization/#5ceb2acd61db">Walker Principles</a></span> would help in make the Appellate Body more efficient and help the body stick to the rules as was determined in 1995.

<strong>To increase reliance on economics and statistics to decide a dispute between two parties- </strong>It is no hidden fact that the task of the Appellate Body is limited to matters of law by establishing and verifying the facts presented to them by the parties. When it comes to the interpretation of various technical terms like ‘less favorable treatment’ (read discrimination), they have discretion on how to interpret them. Since they have not been defined properly anywhere, their employment in the final decision along with economics and statistics will be welcomed by the parties and difficult to question. This shift of using economics and statistics gains traction from the Supreme Court decision which shifted its view on resale price maintenance from the per se rule to the rule of reasoned standard which is to be backed by <span><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=344118088088080064098020011005100065020088069085027026127088021120105111117118103073029114036013107061038025012011011070111122024069091048041118085119092012019010053019055067078089097093093000093123015102081115118097098102087070093085111021001093098&amp;EXT=pdf">economic arguments.</a></span>

<strong>To establish a compliance committee to audit and overlook the functioning of Appellate Body- </strong>To ensure that the fellow members of WTO have faith in the functioning of the Appellate Body, WTO may and should establish a compliance committee every year to audit the working of the Appellate Body. The committee would comprise of the chairs of all the major WTO committees, which include General Council, Council for Trade in Goods, and the Dispute Settlement Body, etc. The committee would be tasked with the job of assessing whether the Appellate Body is performing its principles and if not then what due course to take.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The authors want to highlight that the problem in the World Trade Organization is not only with their Dispute Settlement Understanding but also in a deeper crisis that looms within WTO. WTO members will lose their right to appeal against the decisions of the WTO panels if this crisis is not resolved immediately and this will endanger the future of the organization. If the US keeps blocking appointments of members to the Appellate Body, then this would result in member countries of WTO opting for alternative means. This includes adopting panel reports and appointing another body to resolve their disputes for them. Members can opt not to appeal the decision at all or they might seek to resolve the issue by adopting panel reports, similarly to <span><a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/wto-appellate-bodys-impending-paralysis">Canada and the EU</a></span>. On the surface, this looks sufficient but if you look deeper the problem is very concerning. The WTO was formed to help <span>trade flow as freely as possible and to help settle disputes</span> <span><a href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact1_e.htm">between member countries</a></span>. However, if member countries start to look for other methods to resolve their disputes then this defeats the very purpose of WTO.

With this crisis left unresolved, the US has already moved further away from multilateral trade to negotiating bilateral trade deals with some of its neighbors and trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and China. Other countries have also started to give more attention to regional or multiregional trading blocs like OBOR, SCO, ASEAN, and CPTPP. This does not bode well for the future of the WTO as it will sink and with it the dream of a free and fair global multilateral trading system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The health degree of a society’s well-being is determined by the ideas which take actual shape in the course of its daily self-constitution. In order to reform and even redeem such a society, we have to reform those defining ideas. The quality of our human life is a function of our determining ideas. Law plays a significant and structural role which is also responsible for the creation of an infinitely complex network of legal relations connecting every single individual of a society. Our individual and social behavior derives its genesis from the law, which is responsible for the development of social reality. In the present situation, COVID-19 is our reality. It is an eye-opener for all of us, as a community, as citizens and even as a nation.

In his book ‘Health Care Law,’ J. Montgomery articulated the notion of the right to health by providing two possible conceptions of health: ‘The Social Model’ and ‘The Engineering Model’. The Latter model emphasizes repairing a defective human machine. This model is not immune to challenges because one cannot ascertain the optimum level of health and identify when a particular human-machine becomes defective. This judgment is inherently subjective and medical professionals are accountable for its determination. The former model, on the other side, has a broader amplitude. International legal instrument (as declared in the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/almaata_declaration_en.pdf">Declaration of Alma Ata</a>) is a wider approach that recognizes health as a state of complete mental, physical and social well-being and not merely absence of any infirmity or disease. This approach also identifies health as a fundamental right and that the fulfillment of the highest level of health is important from a global perspective, whose comprehension demands actions of several socio-economic sectors along with healthcare as one. On the contrary, India’s healthcare law might appear quite archaic.

<strong>A Colonial Law versus A Novel Virus</strong>

During the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, British-India was struck by the scourge of bubonic plague (also known as <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjejY2TwuboAhVDQH0KHWXOBgcQFjABegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheory.tifr.res.in%2Fbombay%2Fhistory%2Fplague.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TzBBNBoAvprhqfM7LTyYm">Bombay Plague Epidemic</a></span>). The bubonic plague was responsible for the loss of thousands of human lives. From Mandvi of Bombay (presently Mumbai), the plague gradually engulfed a massive human population within short span of time. In order to combat such an epidemic, the <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijkd_8weboAhXSfX0KHdkuCNcQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findiacode.nic.in%2Fbitstream%2F123456789%2F10469%2F1%2Fthe_epidemic_diseases_act%252C_1897.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw12Gr1gfnKmBbUfl8kxUE4j">Epidemic Diseases Act</a></span> was enacted in 1897. Thereafter, India has encountered several outbreaks of infectious diseases since independence. Cholera O139, Chikungunya, H5N1 Influenza, H1N1 Influenza, Nipah outbreak, Japanese Encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever have emerged and even re-emerged in the recent past. The said law has been repeatedly used by states. The Act of 1897 empowers the state as well as central government to take special measures and prescribe relevant regulations as regards an epidemic disease. Section 2 of the legislation confers a discretionary power upon the state government to adopt temporary regulations to be observed by the public or by any person/class of persons as it shall deem necessary to prevent the outbreak of such epidemic. The central government’s power was however inserted by an amendment in 1920. According to section 2A of the act, the central government, concerned that any part or the entire country is threatened with an outbreak of an epidemic, may take measures and prescribe regulations. As per section 3 of the Act, anyone who violates the act shall be deemed to have committed an offense punishable under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

The <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiC76KzwuboAhWCbysKHUjSCvUQFjACegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mea.gov.in%2FImages%2Fpdf1%2FS7.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sNVSZpRzJSskvqeTdXRCp">VII Schedule of The Constitution of India</a></span> enlists Public Health under State List. Therefore, a lot of discretion is with the state government to adopt, enact, and enforce public health related regulations. Conversely, the state governments are not always financially equipped to take effective measures. Ensuring essential commodities during the time of epidemic is yet another crucial challenge. In spite of these provisions, India’s existing laws fall short of meeting the challenges of a pandemic. With the dynamic and progressive era of globalization, it needs to update its public health law. For example, the modern-day challenges of international air travel, intra-state movement of migrant workers, escalation of population density of urban areas, changing pattern of food habits, use of social media, public distribution system and even climate change contribute to pandemics. Never, in the history of Independent India, has the entire country witnessed such a lockdown. Although the Epidemic Diseases Act appears quite regulatory in nature, it does not address the multi-faceted dimensions of public health issues of India.

<strong>Allied Indian Legislations vis-à-vis Public Health</strong>

India has certain public health enactments with an objective to prevent and control epidemic diseases. For example, <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiGyYvNwuboAhVGfSsKHU-iDpUQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findiacode.nic.in%2Fbitstream%2F123456789%2F2330%2F1%2Fa1898-09.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3uCtKh2gT4j-OwQ-Te7L92">The Live-Stock Importation Act</a></span> primarily regulates the importation of livestock and livestock products which is likely to be affected by infectious and contagious disorders. The same legislation also empowers the state government (Section 4) to make rules for the detention, inspection, disinfection, or destruction of imported livestock. <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7vIzdwuboAhWUA3IKHbfOAYYQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findiacode.nic.in%2Fhandle%2F123456789%2F2344%3Fview_type%3Dbrowse%26sam_handle%3D123456789%2F1362&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gsjJzel0toA-OVIN4tfhv">The Indian Ports Act</a></span> under Section 6 empowers the government to make rules for the prevention of danger arising to the public health by the introduction and the spread of any infectious or contagious disease from vessels arriving at, or being in, any such port, and for the prevention of the conveyance of infection or contagion by means of any vessel sailing from any such port. The <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj36srpwuboAhVHVH0KHeoHArgQFjABegQIAhAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegislative.gov.in%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FA1940-23.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AgolWEEtbhVw2DkeY3MH9">Drugs and Cosmetics Act</a></span> under section 26B empowers the Central Government to regulate, restrict, or manufacture drugs in the public’s interest:
<blockquote>If the Central Government is satisfied that a drug is essential to meet the requirements of an emergency arising due to epidemic or natural calamities and that in the public interest, it is necessary or expedient so to do, then, that Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, regulate or restrict the manufacture, sale or distribution of such drug.</blockquote>
The Ministry of Health &amp; Family Safety of the Government of India launched an <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjktsT1wuboAhXRSH0KHfdaDmcQFjACegQICBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fidsp.nic.in%2Findex4.php%3Flang%3D1%26level%3D0%26linkid%3D313%26lid%3D1592&amp;usg=AOvVaw0S4F_48TCm-nb7ls36dBt_">Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP)</a></span> in 2004 for a period until 2010.  The project was further restructured and extended. As per the project, A Central Surveillance Unit was established in Delhi along with respective State Surveillance Units and District Surveillance Units in all states and districts of the country. The prime objective of IDSP was to strengthen and maintain a decentralized laboratory-based IT enabled disease surveillance system for epidemic prone diseases to monitor disease trends and to detect and respond to outbreaks in early rising phases through a trained Rapid Response Team. The beauty of IDSP lies in its capacity building, data management and surveillance system with application of Information and Communication Technology. Albeit, these enactments are taking public health issues in consideration but our existing situation demands integration and convergence of all the relevant sectors under one legislative roof.

<strong>State-Level Regulations in regards to epidemics &amp; COVID-2019</strong>

India has enacted quite a few state legislations for public health. For example, section 81 of <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2n42Aw-boAhXGT30KHZ6RAuMQFjABegQIAxAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lawsofindia.org%2Fpdf%2Ftamil_nadu%2F1939%2F1939TN3.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pgXZRUtgqm3ZHnySKZAxJ">The Madras Public Health Act</a></span> empowers the government to make such rules as they deem fit for the treatment of persons affected with any epidemic and for preventing the spread of the same. It has even a clause on such infectious diseases that are transmissible through animals (Section 61). Section 86 of <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiK65CNw-boAhWIYisKHc7DCcsQFjABegQICxAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sanchitha.ikm.in%2Fnode%2F2363&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sD2JqduCv3Lyk6eOg0UbB">The Cochin Public Health Act</a></span> empowers the government to make rules as they deem fit for the treatment of persons affected with any epidemic, endemic or even infectious disease. <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjl6e6cw-boAhVabn0KHTW2D9sQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goaprintingpress.gov.in%2Fuploads%2FPublic%2520Health%2520Act%2520and%2520Rules.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw03mcraty5nzSoUBOv4RrqW">The Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act</a></span> was also enacted along similar lines (Section 75).

However, with respect to COVID-19, the Indian states have adopted regulations in furtherance to Epidemic Diseases Act which are quite similar to each other. For example, The <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn4pW5w-boAhWFeX0KHeUkCdMQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpurbamedinipur.gov.in%2Fdownloads%2FEpidemic_Disease_Regulation_covid19.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AcrwAVsNjDMUTs9ZcKN-Y">West Bengal Epidemic Disease COVID 19 Regulations</a></span> mandates all government and private hospitals to have influenza-like illness and flu corners for the screening of suspected COVID-19 cases. The imposition of social distancing has been directed under the 2020 regulation. Certain geographical areas may be declared as containment zones by barring any entry and exit of people or vehicles. Similarly, under <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwja7-jbw-boAhVWWysKHXhBDfsQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maharashtra.gov.in%2FSite%2FUpload%2FActs%2520Rules%2FMarathi%2FKorona%2520Notification%252014%2520March%25202020....pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3I2Zn3fOWlaxyiV-c7kKrv">Maharashtra Regulations for Prevention and Containment of Coronavirus Disease</a></span>, the State Integrated Disease Surveillance Unit (under IDSP) and District Collectors have been entrusted with certain duties and obligations to combat COVID-19.

The Indian government has also taken recourse to <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6hJOow-boAhXZgUsFHXzTBlgQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ndmindia.nic.in%2Fimages%2FThe%2520Disaster%2520Management%2520Act%2C%25202005.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0bI3xpV7zW5lwie1_inVec">Disaster Management Act</a></span> by declaring COVID-19 as a notified disaster.

Previously it was heavily dependent upon imported testing kits. Therefore, we need to consider all these gaps while reforming the healthcare laws. In fact, international legal instruments should also take into account while adopting a comprehensive health law. In absence of a law, it is now with the governments to determine and adopt innovative measures to eliminate this pandemic. The rights of the medical professionals and healthcare personnel, promotion of investments in healthcare sector as well as medical research, the establishment of an emergency fund for pandemic crises, restrictions in travel and movement during pandemic emergency, adoption of a health information system, regulation of animal markets/trade, and alignment of fundamental rights of pandemic law are some core areas that needs immediate attention. In order to regulate the avenues of social distancing, mandatory isolation and quarantine, inclusive public health laws should also consider the thresholds as enshrined under Article 19 and Article 21 of The Constitution of India.

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>

All of the aforesaid legislation, regulations, and initiatives are relevant in the current context, but they fail to address the ethical issue of equitable access to public healthcare. In this context, <span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR6-efxOboAhWTWX0KHTwxB5kQFjACegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prsindia.org%2Fuploads%2Fmedia%2FDraft_National_Bill.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw26BgVz_JU1mmwp4FAGqPe2">The National Health Bill of 2009</a></span> was quite progressive as it touched upon the human rights dimension of public healthcare. The bill defined epidemic as an “occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what is usually expected for a given period of time, and also includes any reference to disease outbreak.” Section 5 of the bill imposed certain obligations upon the governments to ensure comparable priority towards a right to quality health care services and the well-being of all as well as to take effective measures to prevent, treat, and control epidemics and endemic diseases. In a way, it was a very dynamic bill but unfortunately never saw the light of the day. India should consider revisiting certain aspects of the bill.

Lawrence Gostin once conceptualized public health law as, “at its core, the authority and responsibility of government to ensure the conditions for the population’s health” but it is also an individual and communitarian responsibility when there is a pandemic. Public health is related to the element of population-based services which are based on public health methodologies. Health authorities have the power to coerce individuals and businesses for community protection. It addresses a relationship between the population and state because the latter has not only power but also a duty to protect the health of the population. Once India manages to flatten the growth curve of COVID-19, it should consider refurbishing its public health law by not only reaffirming Montgomery’s ‘Social Model’ but also by adopting an overarching public health law with pandemic as one of its elements. We as humans should also refurbish our ways of life by aspiring for a better future by contributing to the pivotal process of self-creating and self-imagining.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The novel coronavirus has disrupted the lives of billions globally. In the United States, as Americans shelter in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, so too stop the “normal” functions of the country. Americans are being laid off and filing for unemployment benefits at the highest levels <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/02/unemployment-claims-coronavirus-pandemic-161081">ever recorded</a>. Nearly 40,000 people who seek asylum or legal immigration continue to be detained in unsanitary conditions, even though the virus has been documented at <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AMR5120952020ENGLISH.PDF">multiple facilities</a>. Concerns over privacy and data protection <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/digital-privacy-coronavirus.html">loom</a> over all who have transitioned to working from home. Shelter-in-place orders have also created a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/world/coronavirus-domestic-violence.html?fbclid=IwAR28GTmR4t3CHJR85jLLGPaSUhpjOINKkuumBPA-3_aIUJyuzTLzm2x6Fh0">spike</a> in domestic violence. When the dust has finally settled from this pandemic, those affected will need a solution.

As is common in this country, that solution is most likely to be handed down in a court of law, which means that those who have been affected by this crisis will need effective advocates. And yet this year’s graduating law class—students who have studied the law and worked in the legal field for three years, and who have just submitted their applications to practice law—are facing similar uncertainties about the future. In light of the pandemic, multiple jurisdictions (including <a href="https://www.nybarexam.org/Press/PressRelease_NY_BarExam.pdf">New York</a>, <a href="https://masslawyersweekly.com/2020/04/04/new-date-set-for-postponed-july-bar-exam/">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/CBEC/">Connecticut</a>) have announced that they have postponed the July Bar Examination, with no alternate opportunities for licensure. This is unacceptable. Instead, graduating law students across the country are beginning our careers as our own first advocates. In California, we are asking for emergency diploma privileges in the event that the July Bar is cancelled here, too. Instead of a traditional license to practice law arising from bar passage, emergency diploma privilege would create automatic admission to the state bar upon graduation from an accredited law school, provided graduates meet other minimum standards such as character and fitness requirements. These privileges will allow law school graduates to begin working and helping their communities immediately during this unprecedented crisis.

Although some jurisdictions have postponed the July bar exam since it is unsafe to administer in-person exams, it is unclear when it will be safe enough to resume testing. In California, every testing center for Bar administration holds hundreds of test takers at a time. This state has been one of the most aggressive in implementing measures to flatten the curve, and it is not likely that these measures will be loosened enough to accommodate hundreds of in one location until their welfare can be ensured. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a vaccine for the disease can still take at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/us/coronavirus-vaccine-timetable-concerns-experts-invs/index.html">18 months</a> to distribute to the public.

Postponing the bar exam will delay law school graduates from entering the legal profession and serving clients. Emergency diploma privileges are the only equitable solution in the face of this unprecedented pandemic. Holding or postponing the bar will have a devastating impact on clients and students alike. Over <a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Admissions/Law-School-Regulation/Exam-Statistics">4,000 law graduates</a> take the July Bar Examination in California each year. Without an equitable solution, thousands of law graduates will be unable to practice in the upcoming year, and even more clients will be left unserved at a time when they need it the most.

Therefore, the law students in California have put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qXR9o42rzV1VHPGzpa3RfW3x5FROJjUJs44Fb5vqvGo/edit">petition and letter</a> for the State Bar of California; nationally, law students and practitioners have sent a <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/over-2000-law-school-students-sign-letter-seeking-diploma-privileged-licensure/">letter</a> advocating for this same privilege to the National Conference of Bar Examiners. We advocate for emergency diploma privilege for all California Bar applicants. This privilege must be more than just a temporary license. There is no guarantee that employers will allow test takers the appropriate amount of time to study for the bar. Some test takers may have to quit their jobs to take the bar. Thus, emergency diploma privilege must give  the ability to practice law to all students without having to take the bar exam at a later time.

Some jurisdictions, such as <a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/bardiploma.htm">Wisconsin</a>, allow law students graduating from accredited law schools that comply with certain terms to attain diploma privilege. This practice has existed in Wisconsin since 1870. Other jurisdictions, like <a href="https://www.jdjournal.com/2020/04/01/more-bar-exam-delays-announced-law-students-push-for-emergency-diploma-privilege/">New Jersey</a>, have allotted some form of provisional licensing by allowing graduating law students to practice under supervision of a licensed attorney. California has always been a leader in progressive change and should continue its legacy in implementing necessary change amidst a global epidemic.

		<title>Diploma Privilege or Bust: Delayed Bar Exam Would Harm Graduating Law Students and Vulnerable Pennsylvanians in Light of COVID-19</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Members of Pennsylvania’s most vulnerable communities are at risk of losing access to essential legal services in the face of the unprecedented public health crisis, economic turmoil, and social disruption brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Graduating law students could help fill this growing need, but it is unclear whether we will be given the chance.

The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners, which serves as the gatekeeper to the practice of law in our state, is currently considering alternatives to the July 2020 bar exam. As of this writing, over 300 graduating law students, law professors, and practitioners have signed a <a href="https://bit.ly/34nTJ8j">letter</a> requesting that the Board of Law Examiners adopt a policy of emergency diploma privileges in order to ensure that graduating law students have an equal opportunity to gain admission to the Pennsylvania Bar. This policy would grant students automatic admission upon graduation from an accredited law school, provided that they satisfy other minimum standards, such as character and fitness requirements.

Even more importantly, emergency diploma privileges would ensure that Pennsylvanians do not lose access to essential legal services in the face of an unprecedented public health crisis that has collapsed the economy and disrupted our daily lives. Some states, like <a href="/commentary/2020/04/ahmed-blase-diploma-privilege/">California</a>, are currently considering if they should grant emergency diploma privileges, which would allow recent law graduates to gain full admission to the state bar if they meet certain ethical standards. Utah has proposed a modified policy of emergency diploma privileges.

We are asking that the Board avoid the messy alternative chosen by states, such as <a href="https://www.jdjournal.com/2020/04/01/more-bar-exam-delays-announced-law-students-push-for-emergency-diploma-privilege/">New Jersey</a>, who have postponed the July Bar exam and will grant temporary licensure to graduates. Under this approach, commonly referred to as “temporary licensure,” recent graduates would be required to take the bar exam at a later date, and any graduate who fails to pass the exam within the designated period of time would lose their temporary license to practice law. Temporary licensure may seem appealing as it moves the problem to some unspecified point in the future, but it is not a solution. It would demand an uncertain future administration of the bar exam, inevitably disrupt the careers of an entire class of new lawyers, and limit the capacity of legal organizations through supervision requirements in the meantime.

The COVID-19 Task Force of the Pennsylvania Bar Association (PBA) has recognized that a policy of temporary licensure proposal would reduce the public’s access to essential legal services and delay recent graduates’ full admission to the bar based on conditions beyond our control. It would also make it impossible for many graduates to gain full admission to the bar until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and no one knows when that will be. Many recent graduates would have to study for the bar exam while struggling to earn an income. But as most lawyers know, studying for the bar exam is itself a full-time job, and statistics have shown that the bar exam is more difficult for students who study for the exam while attempting to earn a living.

To ensure that the public does not lose access to essential legal services and to minimize the unforeseen burdens that recent law graduates now must bear, the PBA’s COVID-19 Task Force specifically <a href="/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/Report-and-Recommendation_COVID-19-Task-Force_Subcommittee-on-Bar-10.pdf">recommended</a> that:
<blockquote>students who graduate in May 2020 be issued a provisional license with specific additional requirements...and that, if those graduates complete additional requirements established by the Board of Law Examiners, they be issued a full license without the need to take the bar examination.</blockquote>
To be sure, this solution is far more equitable and sensible than postponing the bar exam or requiring that applicants take the exam online, which would raise a host of logistical issues that are unlikely to be resolved in time for the July 2020 exam.

Nevertheless, the deans of all nine Pennsylvania law schools have requested that the Board of Law Examiners adopt a policy of temporary licensure, despite student recommendations and advocacy for emergency diploma privilege. Although there has been a robust organizing effort from law students across the state, the deans did not give us a meaningful opportunity to voice our concerns before they made their request to the Board.

Leading members of the Pennsylvania legal community, including the leadership of the <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1262894">Philadelphia Bar Association</a>, have expressed that the bar exam is necessary in order to protect the integrity of the legal profession and to ensure that Pennsylvanians receive the quality of legal services that they are entitled to. In other words, the bar exam is necessary to ensure that every member of the Pennsylvania Bar is competent to practice law.

Many lawyers, however, have <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/building-a-better-bar-exam">questioned</a> whether the bar exam actually tests applicants on the skills they need to practice law competently. In fact, the PBA’s COVID-19 Task Force’s recommendation suggests that the Board can ensure that recent law graduates are competent to practice law without requiring them to take the bar exam at a later date. But we are not faced with the question of whether the bar exam effectively measures an applicant’s competence. Rather, the most pressing question is how to ensure that the Pennsylvanians who need our help receive the legal services they need.

The most equitable and sensible response to the COVID-19 crisis is a policy of emergency diploma privileges because Pennsylvanians, especially members of our most vulnerable communities, need us now more than ever. Any delay in the admission of May 2020 graduates to the Pennsylvania Bar would widen existing disparities in the access to legal services. Our request that the Board grant emergency diploma privileges upon satisfaction of the character and fitness requirements would ensure that the public has access to the legal services to which they are entitled; otherwise, many Pennsylvanians may not receive them at all.

		<title>Prisoner Disenfranchisement: India Needs a Middle Ground</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Universal suffrage has long been accepted as the standard for enfranchisement in democracies, however full and equal participation is rarely the reality. One group in particular that is frequently excluded across jurisdictions is prisoners.

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indian law provides for this exclusion in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/5827315/">Section 62(5)</a> of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This exclusion has faced and passed constitutional challenges in the past and, as recently as February 2020, the constitutional validity of this exclusion was once again upheld by the Delhi High Court in its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ap0A46fg8i1anDGB_zonb121QnvaRUWz/view">judgment</a> in <em>Praveen Kumar Chaudhary v. Election Commission of India</em>.</span>

This article examines the theoretical justifications for prisoner disenfranchisement, relevant international human rights instruments and comparative perspectives, and argues that India needs to adopt a "middle-ground" strategy on the issue of prisoner disenfranchisement.
<h4>Theoretical Justifications for Prisoner Disenfranchisement</h4>
On a theoretical basis, prisoner disenfranchisement has constantly been grounded upon the popular <a href="https://howardleague.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/HLWP_20_2015.pdf">theory</a> of "civil death," which seeks to justify prisoner disenfranchisement on the principle that those who violate established community practices forfeit their rights to engage in the democratic polity. Other <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1341296?seq=1">theories</a> such as the "purity of the ballot box," which seeks to protect the purity and integrity of the ballot box by disallowing "morally" corrupt people from voting, and the popular "deterrence" theory have also been invoked to justify prisoner disenfranchisement.

Yet, it must be noted that sufficient rebuttals have been provided by a number of scholars to the aforementioned justifications, so much so that the tenacity of these justifications has been questioned across jurisdictions. Some notable <a href="https://www.bu.edu/ilj/files/2014/05/Ziegler-finalpdf.pdf">counter-arguments</a> are:
<ol>
 	<li>The offender’s liberty, along with the rest of his/her rights, is not removed in its entirety when a custodial sentence is passed; instead, although a custodial sentence inevitably entails the deprivation of some elements of liberty, a serving prisoner retains his/her residual liberty.</li>
 	<li>Convicts who commit non-electoral offenses do not necessarily possess a higher propensity than the general population to commit electoral offenses.</li>
 	<li>In terms of characterizing disenfranchisement as a deterrent mechanism, no study has shown a correlation between the disenfranchisement of convicts and a reduction in crime rates. On the other hand, there is ample literature highlighting the negative effects of disenfranchisement on convicts, social groups as well as democratic electoral processes as a whole.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Existing Framework in India</h4>
In categorical terms, prisoner disenfranchisement <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/08_18_03_Manatt_Brandon_Rottinghaus.pdf">frameworks</a> across the world can be divided into four categories: (1) less restrictive frameworks that allow prisoners to vote; (2) moderately restrictive frameworks that allow prisoners to vote under specific circumstances; (3) highly restrictive frameworks that do not allow prisoners to vote; and (4) most restrictive frameworks that do not allow prisoners to vote and restrict voting even after a prison term is complete.

The existing prisoner disenfranchisement framework in India can easily be placed under the "highly restrictive" category. Section 62(5) of the Representation of the People Act, which is at the core of this framework, disallows both convicts as well as detainees (other than those in preventive detention) from voting. The said provision follows a "blanket-ban" approach towards prisoner disenfranchisement and makes no mention of proportionality based on the gravity of the offense.

In the 1997 <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1670642/">case</a> of <em>Anukul Chandra Pradhan v. Union of India</em>, the said provision was challenged on the ground that it violates <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/367586/">Article 14</a> of the Indian Constitution, as it makes an arbitrary distinction between people who are in prison and people who are out on bail or parole. Further, the restriction applies to a person who is in the lawful custody of the police. It was further contended that the said provision violates <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution.

The Supreme Court of India rejected the aforementioned challenge ruling that the distinction is not arbitrary because it is relatable to the object sought to be achieved by the legislation, which was to prevent the criminalization of politics and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. The court further stated that a person who is in prison as a result of his own conduct and is, therefore, deprived of his liberty during the period of his imprisonment cannot claim equal freedom of movement, speech and expression with the others who are not in prison. Lastly, it was reiterated that in India, the right to vote is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right. It is a statutory right that is granted and restricted by the Representation of the People Act.

The Delhi High Court, in its February 2020 judgment, did not have much of an option but to follow the aforementioned decision of the apex court. The reasoning of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, however, is questionable based on the counter-arguments against prisoner disenfranchisement highlighted in the preceding section. Furthermore, with the right to vote being statutory, the court should not have discussed prisoner disenfranchisement through the lens of fundamental rights at all.
<h4>Human Rights and Comparative Perspectives</h4>
Although there are a number of international human rights instruments governing the disposition of political and civil rights worldwide, none of these instruments deal specifically with the issue of prisoner or ex-prisoner voting rights. Rather, these documents deal with more general civil and political voting rights.

Article 25 of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) is arguably the leading international treaty provision concerning the right to vote. It reads as follows:
<blockquote>Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:
(a) To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;
(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;
(c) To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country.</blockquote>
Article 2 of the same instrument imposes a prohibition on distinctions made on the basis of “race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. The question that must be answered then is: whether prisoner disenfranchisement falls under the category of unreasonable restrictions?

A <a href="https://www.bu.edu/ilj/files/2014/05/Ziegler-finalpdf.pdf">deconstruction</a> of the term "unreasonable restrictions” using various interpretative models such as dynamic treaty interpretation or the views of the UN Human Rights Committee, suggests that disenfranchisement of ex-convicts, as well as the "blanket" disenfranchisement of convicts, may be incompatible with treaty obligations. A <a href="https://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/general%20comment%2025.pdf">comment</a> of the Human Rights Committee regarding Article 25 of the ICCPR suggests that the period of suspension of their (convicts) right to vote “should be proportionate” to the offense and the sentence.

This middle-ground approach based on the proportionality principle has been followed by a number of <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/08_18_03_Manatt_Brandon_Rottinghaus.pdf">countries</a> across the world such as Australia, China, and Germany. The approach simply stipulates that the “more serious the crime involved, the less eligible to vote prisoners become.”

A number of courts across jurisdictions have also criticized the blanket disenfranchisement approach. The South African Constitutional Court through the <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/10.pdf">NICRO</a> judgment invalidated a blanket ban on prisoner’s franchise rights. In reaching its conclusions, the South African Court extensively referred to the <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2010/index.do">Suavé</a> judgment of the Canadian Supreme Court, which unanimously invalidated blanket disenfranchisement legislation. In Suave, the Canadian Supreme Court noted: “Universal franchise has become an essential part of democracy and that the legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote.”

Further, the European Court of Human Rights while dealing with a challenge to Section 3 of the UK’s Representation of the People Act in the <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{%22fulltext%22:[%22Hirst%22],%22documentcollectionid2%22:[%22GRANDCHAMBER%22,%22CHAMBER%22],%22itemid%22:[%22001-70442%22]}">Hirst</a> case held that although the right to vote is not an absolute right, a blanket ban on prisoner’s franchise rights, irrespective of the gravity of the crime and duration of the sentence, was not justified.

It must be noted that even after the <em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hirst</span></em> judgment, the UK has <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/tablas/r33376.pdf">not changed</a> its approach towards prisoner disenfranchisement. Further, in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253315719_The_Truly_Disfranchised_Felon_Voting_Rights_and_American_Politics">US</a>, as many as forty-eight states restrict inmates from voting while serving time, and at least 32 states bar ex-inmates from voting, either permanently or for several years after their release from prison.
<h4>The Way Forward for India</h4>
Disenfranchisement has multiple negative consequences for convicts on an individual basis as well as a societal basis. Denying all convicts the right to vote, perhaps their most expressive activity as community members, further degrades and isolates them as individuals. It also degrades the entire possibility of converting prison systems into reformative models in the 21st Century.

Due to the existing framework, more than 400,000 prisoners are barred (at present) from voting in India. Despite being a party to the ICCPR as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, India remains one of the very few countries to retain a blanket ban on prisoner franchise rights. Time has come for the Indian legislature to amend its law on prisoner disenfranchisement and adopt a middle-ground approach based on the proportionality principle. A proportionality-based approach is not only in conformity with international human rights instruments but also the only justified nexus between conviction and disenfranchisement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/448/555/">Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia</a> (1980), the Supreme Court of the United States wrote, “People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.”

It’s easy to visualize, ahem, <em>colorful</em> presidential press conferences and vigorous congressional debates on C-SPAN because of broadcasts on national television. However, when it comes to the Court, supreme secrecy dominates an insulated society of robe-clad elders. Only about a few lucky 200 people per day can see our third branch of government in action. Of course, audio recordings of oral arguments are posted soon after they are conducted, but they are not an adequate substitute. For millions of Americans, real-time depictions are blacked out but for the few who have the means to travel to Washington D.C. and pack into the gallery.

The Supreme Court does not currently allow its public oral arguments to be televised, videotaped, or photographed. To date, only two photographs and one video have ever been taken while the Court was in session by individuals who brought secret cameras inside, with one individual, Dr. Erich Salmon, faking a broken arm to hide a camera in his cast. Current justices have offered divergent perspectives on cameras. Justices Elena Kagan and Samuel Alito recently <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/03/justices-alito-and-kagan-testify-before-house-committee-on-courts-budget/">addressed</a> the topic last year before House lawmakers, expressing apprehension. Although Justice Kagan conceded that the topic had not been broached in their private sessions during her time on the Court, she, along with Justice Alito, worried that cameras may negatively influence the decision-making process by prompting theatrics from attorneys and justices. On the other hand, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg “[doesn’t] see any problem with having proceedings televised” because “it would be good for the public.”

Although the visibility debate has ebbed and flowed throughout the decades as small steps have been made to increase transparency by releasing transcripts and audio recordings, in light of a global pandemic, the Court has made an unprecedented move. On April 13, 2020, the Court issued an announcement that it would hear oral arguments telephonically in a number of previously postponed cases and provide media outlets with a live stream of the proceedings. For the first time in history, real-time audio access will be available. This is a noteworthy step in the right direction, which may reflect changing attitudes on the Court.

When I think about why video footage matters, I am reminded of an oral argument I recently listened to in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-sineneng-smith/">United States v. Sineneng-Smith</a>. After a colloquy between an advocate and Justice Steven Breyer about essentially re-writing the statute at issue, Chief Justice John Roberts quipped, “Would we have to get that passed by the Senate and House?” That jest was followed by a distinct laugh emanating from the bench. I would not have known that that laugh came from Justice Clarence Thomas had my professor—who’s met Justice Thomas—not pointed it out during our discussion of the case. All of this to exemplify that there are important verbal and non-verbal intimations that occur during oral arguments that cannot be ascertained from an audio recording alone. Allowing cameras in the courtroom would importantly cue listeners into noteworthy body language, the demeanor of the advocates, and the complete story of the arena that births decisions that substantially impact the lives of Americans.

The move to stream audio footage in real-time during this pandemic will hopefully serve as a catalyst to complete accessibility through live video streams. Rather than backtracking in a post-pandemic world, the Court should finally succumb to the most democratically-sound means of public participation in its proceedings. The Constitution grants an enormous amount of power—along with lifetime appointments—to a handful of unelected justices. The American people collectively pay a hefty amount of money to fund this government institution. At the very least, they ought to be able to observe it at work.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a time where people are getting seriously ill and dying (and not from a zombie apocalypse), society is faced with the moral question of whether we should release individuals from jails so that we can protect them from contracting, and dying from, COVID-19. It is no secret that <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/rikers-coronavirus-cases-increase.html">jails</a> are a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/13/833440047/the-covid-19-struggle-in-chicagos-cook-county-jail">hotspot</a> for COVID-19 incidence, and that incarcerated individuals are among the most <a href="http://bostonreview.net/class-inequality-science-nature/amy-kapczynski-gregg-gonsalves-alone-against-virus">vulnerable</a>. Like every individual who has no other card to play, Ken W.Good <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/04/the-covid-19-apocalypse-rules-for-survival/">throws</a> out a hail-Mary appeal to “public safety,” arguing that COVID-19 should not be used as a “get out of jail free” card. He argues that individuals who are released on very low bonds or their personal recognizance are a threat to public safety, and that they are contributing to an uptick in crime since the COVID-19 crisis began. He then dictates several “rules for survival” that counties should follow to protect “public safety.” What he ignores, however, is that individuals who are incarcerated are also members of the public, <strong><em>and their safety matters too</em></strong>.

Mr. Good borrows his “rules of survival” from the comedy/zombie apocalypse movie <em>Zombieland</em>, and his piece relies on an extended metaphor from the movie. However, Mr. Good fails to mention that <em>Zombieland’s</em> rules were about personal safety, not public safety—this fatal flaw seriously decapitates Mr. Good’s metaphor. Moreover, Columbus—<em>Zombieland’s</em> main character who created the rules for his own survival—broke his own rules numerous times throughout the film. Oh, and Columbus never dies in spite of breaking his rules. Mr. Good’s piece boils down to the untenable suggestion that adherence to strict rules—again, which he gets from a comedy film—are more important than saving people’s lives. In return, we suggest one simple rule: let people go.

Mr. Good, a significant voice of the Texas bail industrial complex, expresses concern over several things: (1) counties have been slowing down arrests; (2) counties have refused to make arrests for certain crimes including theft; and (3) judges have released individuals on extremely low bonds or their own personal recognizance. This, he argues, is particularly problematic in light of the fact that domestic violence reports have surged, burglaries have spiked in Houston, and crimes against businesses have increased in addition to online fraud. He then states that if these concerns go unaddressed, we will see an increase in vigilante justice from the public.

Mr. Good is wrong on all fronts.

First and foremost, crime is <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/27/as-coronavirus-surges-crime-declines-in-some-cities">not</a> up. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marleycoyne/2020/04/11/crime-rates-across-us-drop-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#ddf430311e31">Crime</a> has <a href="https://time.com/5819507/crime-drop-coronavirus/">actually decreased</a>. Mr. Good is just trying to escalate the public’s panic surrounding the pandemic as a way for his industry to capitalize on bail bond profits.

Second, his first “rule,” which states that counties should employ a temporary bail schedule, is particularly problematic. Bail schedules typically dictate bond amounts based on the offense an individual is being charged with, or on the maximum sentence for the crime they were arrested for. When an individual is arrested, if they can afford to post bail, they can do so immediately at the police station under a bail schedule without going to jail or to court. Mr. Good touts this as a solution, because, he reasons, individuals will get to avoid jail—and contracting COVID-19, evidently—while awaiting trial.

However, <a href="https://www.justia.com/criminal/bail-bonds/bail-schedules/">bail schedules</a> are extremely rigid and inflexible. When a judge sets bail in court post-arraignment, they can consider factors such as criminal history, employment status, family issues, and ties to the community. Bail schedules consider none of these things.

Another flaw with this “rule” is that individuals are frequently arrested and charged with the most serious crime that the evidence may support, which puts arrestees in higher “brackets” for purposes of bonding out under a bail schedule. Moreover, <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/dccc.pdf">eighty percent</a> of individuals who are arrested and charged with a crime fall below the poverty line, meaning they require a public defender. They cannot afford an attorney, and they are equally unlikely to be able to afford bond. The logical conclusion of Mr. Good’s “rule” is that the wealthy will be able to bond out, as they always have been, and the poor will be left behind. So, nothing new.

It is also important to highlight that Mr. Good offers this “rule” as a purported solution for judges who have, in light of COVID-19, been releasing individuals on very low bonds or on their own recognizance. However, Mr. Good is not a disinterested party in such a “rule.” Which is to say that Mr. Good, a Board Member of the Professional Bondsmen of Texas, is offering a solution that would result in more people purchasing bail bonds, which would put more money in his and other bondsmen’s hands.

Mr. Good’s purported concern with letting people go is “public safety,” but a temporary bail schedule will not do anything to protect the public. He cites—with concern—the fact that someone accused of a violent crime was released on $10 bail. But, setting higher bail amounts does not deter crime, nor is bail supposed to. The sole purpose of setting bail is to ensure that one shows up to their court dates so that the state may prosecute them. In fact, when Kentucky eliminated bail bonds altogether, it actually enjoyed a <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/Portals/1/Documents/magazine/articles/2014/SLG_0214_Pretrial_1.pdf">decrease</a> in crime connected to pretrial release. Mr. Good cites no sources to prove that his concern about low or no bail amounts provoking vigilante justice is based in reality.

Mr. Good also suggests in his “rules” that all arraignments should be conducted via video conference. While we agree that conducting certain court proceedings via video conference is the safest option for all involved, a far better rule would be to arraign far fewer people. With jails becoming the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-cook-county-jail-chicago.html">epicenter</a> of COVID-19, counties should try to keep as many people out of them as possible, particularly if the individual does not pose a real and present danger to the public.

Mr. Good’s next “rule” essentially suggests that counties should keep track of who entered the jail so they aren’t held longer than the potential sentence their crime could incur. This rule doesn’t go far enough. In the United States, individuals are innocent until proven guilty. Allowing innocent people to sit in jail before court dates that keep getting pushed further and further out is the same as forcing them to play Russian Roulette. More of them will die; it is only a matter of time. For example, two <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/14/second-rikers-island-inmate-dead-from-coronavirus/">individuals</a> incarcerated on Rikers Island in New York City have already died from COVID-19 that they contracted while incarcerated.

Finally, Mr. Good suggests that, in order to relieve the strain on backlogged criminal courts, courts should divert more individuals to <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/5982.htm">mental health court</a> and <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/opioids/treatment/drug-courts/index.html">drug court</a>. But individuals who would be eligible for diversion into mental health court and drug court are not typically a public safety risk. In fact, these are precisely the groups of people that counties are <a href="https://www.wkbn.com/news/coronavirus/mahoning-county-jail-refusing-some-inmates-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak/">refusing</a> to arrest in an attempt to prevent strain on backlogged courts. Counties should continue refusing to arrest these individuals. Marginalized communities are always hit hardest by <a href="https://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/race-and-drug-war">public health crises</a>, and they are the same people who are going to languish in jail if they cannot afford to bond out.

To liken the literal horror of people in jail contracting and dying from COVID-19 to a comedic zombie apocalypse movie shows Mr. Good’s true colors. As a profiteer of the pretrial industrial complex, it is clear that Mr. Good lacks compassion for those who are incarcerated. When he declares that releasing people from jail will cause a public safety apocalypse, Mr. Good is telling us—and we must take him at his word—that he does not view people in jail as members of the public as worthy of safety. Again, the safety of those of us who are incarcerated matters too. The truth of the matter is that incarceration during a pandemic is lethal. There is no way to make jails safe from a viral pandemic like COVID-19, and there is also no way to socially distance in jails. Access to healthcare in jail is atrocious. To that end, we believe decarceration is the only moral answer to the question of what to do with individuals detained pretrial. An actual concern for public safety should factor in the safety of those who are in jail, and those of us who could end up in jail, during this pandemic.

The only way to save lives—and to protect public safety—is to let people go. We demand decarceration now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“A civilization that proves incapable of solving the problems that it creates is a decadent civilization.”

Aimé Césaire wrote this in his <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/product/discourse_on_colonialism/">critique</a> of colonialism. Close examination of the legacy of colonialism helps explain the disparate impact of the current healthcare crisis based on race and class. The sick and dying in the US are disproportionately the poor, the black, and the brown. Does anyone really care or is this just our form of domestic incapability of solving the problems that we create in our system?

Who is harvesting our food? Who delivers groceries and prescriptions to the doorsteps of those with a credit card and the internet? Who launders hospital and medical garments? Who provides care in nursing homes? Who rides the subway or the bus to and from work? Who today would argue that these services are not of central importance to our society? But do we act as if the people who provide these services are central?

A service economy has workers. When there is a pandemic killing and incapacitating these central workers, do we callously discard them like so much damaged goods and bring in others? Rationalizing that they were on their last legs anyway as if we knew them. Or worse, do we shake our heads in sadness but do little to address the systemic weaknesses that are revealed by the pandemic?

Do we provide healthcare for these workers? If not, then are these workers just considered expendable humans? Whether their deaths are a thousand, a hundred thousand, or a million, are we really not to consider them our concern? Do we continue our smug indifference to the outsider from our comfortable suburban shelter in place? Like a king's court packing up and going to the country during a plague, do we passively wait out the disaster that has become the lives of these workers?

We note that corporations that pay low wages have encouraged their workers to apply for food stamps, privatizing profits and socializing the costs of feeding their employees.

What about healthcare? Should we offer an equivalent "healthcare" stamp to all those who need it? Unless one counts emergency room visits as healthcare—<em>in extremis</em> healthcare differing significantly from the concierge service provided with a premium coverage—we offer nothing to these most vulnerable workers working to save our lives but not their own.

When we watch the paucity of testing, the scramble at the local, state and federal level to find PPE and equipment to address the sick and dying, the price-gouging in distribution, the lack of either price or distribution discipline by persons seeking to make a quick buck with little risk, do we see a market acting efficiently? And this scramble is going on worldwide in a setting where the supply is difficult to increase while demand for healthcare explodes.

It is obvious that there is NO market at work.

Rather we merely have sellers doing price arbitrage between countries, between the federal government, one state or another, one hospital or another, one dying patient and another. This situation is a most horrible example of a worldwide as well as domestic market failure.

To think the market can provide a solution for healthcare for these central vulnerable workers is to place ideology over reality. The market is not working and will not work for the vulnerable here or the vulnerable around the world without disciplined intervention by central governments and coordination to provide the public good that is healthcare.

The true poverty in America is in our souls and our lack of willingness as a nation to do enough about this systemic failure.

We can do better if we can raise our expectations as to what government can and should do. For in these circumstances, like sometimes in the law, the market is an ass. And if we are too enamored of the market, we are decadent accomplices in atrocities that harken back to colonialism’s indifference to human life. We need to protect the human right to health and well-being as it is certain that the market fails us all.

We have little problem with regulatory intervention to correct market failure in the form of antitrust laws—and, in case of declared emergencies, we have scattered prohibitions against price gouging. We even protect natural resources from market forces with our nation’s parks. Examples of our correcting for market failures abound. There is no justification for lack of corrective action here unless the shortcomings in our healthcare delivery system are necessary byproducts of a decadent society clinging to aspects of its colonial past.

<strong>The rush to re-open the economy is a rush of lemmings to the sea.</strong>

As of April 16, 2020, the federal government has proposed a three-phase Opening Up America Again <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/">plan</a>. The preconditions for entering the phases (gating criteria) announced are:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-95914" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/Graph-for-Ben-and-Bill-COVID-Article.png" alt="" width="620" height="461" />

&nbsp;

<strong>Symptoms</strong>: under these guidelines there is an alternative given for gating between Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI) and COVID-Like Syndromic Cases (CLSC). The actual <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/04102020/nssp-regions.html">datasets</a> on the CDC website make a distinction between visits to the emergency department for ILI and COVID-Like Illnesses (CLI). As such, the obvious question is what relevance does a decrease in ILI visits have to the spread of CLI? In addition, the requirement refers to a 14-day downward trajectory in both cases. The definition of an appropriate downward trajectory for the 14-day period is not provided. No doubt we will be assured of some forthcoming “guidance” on the nature of such a downward trajectory, but that may not be enough. It is not clear how a downward trajectory in ILI would have any meaning for CLI (see graph below). The way the criteria are set one could imagine a downward trajectory for ILI and a flat or increasing trajectory for CLI and a state might be able to argue it has complied with the symptom definition. Moreover, the curious inclusion of the word “syndromic” in the CLSC (and not CLI) definition in the guidance—a term that is not used at the level of the datasets raises a question as to whether a definitional sleight-of-hand is being employed with respect to what is the universe of CLI cases as opposed to CLSC cases. So by redefining the word syndromic one can give the impression of declining while in the community as a whole the actual number of CLI cases is stable or increasing.

<a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/not-like-the-flu-not-like-car-crashes-not-like"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-95931 size-full" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/Ben-and-Bill-Graph-e1587226407988.png" alt="" width="838" height="425" /></a>

<strong>Cases</strong>: the insertion of the term “documented” before “cases” raises a question as to how a case becomes documented. The word “documented” either modifies "cases" or it is redundant. We do not doubt that the word “documented” has significance, but its definition is unavailable. The logical impact of that restriction, however, will most likely be to reduce the number of cases or raise criteria for documentation, which will limit what is considered a case. So rather than a capacious vision of cases, this language suggests a more restrictive vision of cases.

Turning to tests, the downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests presents a numerator/denominator interplay. If one reduces the number of tests, one by definition reduces the number of positive tests found. If one is not testing much now and one continues to test at that rate then one can maintain the positive tests at a flat level. Moreover, if one is selective in where one does the tests in the 14-day period, it is likely that one can influence the results by choosing where and whom to test. Put another way, both of these criteria—much like the symptoms criteria—seem eminently malleable.

Hospitals: treating all patients without crisis care in a situation where an estimated 20 percent of persons infected are hospitalized and 5 percent of all persons infected go to the ICU, raises the question of what is meant by “crisis care.” Again, this may have a distinct definition but the language is unclear. Turning to robust testing, that testing set up is only for at-risk healthcare workers (meaning that healthcare workers can be divided into at-risk and not-at-risk according to some criteria). Who is included in the definition of at-risk healthcare workers is a mystery. Moreover, this kind of robust testing program is not foreseen for the population of a given state, but only for the healthcare workers. Contrast these gating criteria with the World Health Organization <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/statements/2020/statement-transition-to-a-new-normal-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-must-be-guided-by-public-health-principles">guidelines </a>which are more categoric.

<strong>Any step to ease restrictions must ensure</strong>:

1. That evidence shows COVID-19 transmission is controlled.

Given the significant wiggle room in the federal government's gating criteria, it is hard to see that compliance with those criteria will provide evidence that COVID-19 transmission is controlled at all.

2. That public health and health system capacities, including hospitals, are in place to identify, isolate, test, and trace and quarantine contacts.

Again, the gating criteria say nothing about identifying, isolating, tracing, and quarantining and only marginally discuss testing in two forms that are easily manipulated. In addition, the capacity issue on each of these crucial tasks is omitted from the discussion when we know that testing and the related material and personnel needed to do this properly are lacking across the US. The proposed federal guidelines do not speak to availability of resources, such as gloves, masks, ventilators and other essential equipment to manage possible spikes in cases.

3. That outbreak risks are minimized in high-vulnerability settings – particularly in elderly homes, mental health facilities and for people residing in crowded places.

Again, note that the gating criteria do not address this particular concern. Rather those concerns are addressed in phases one, two and three of the program. The result is that inevitably the vulnerability of certain settings will be rationalized away by those eager to get to the gating criteria rather than urgently addressing high-vulnerability settings as a first step.

4. That workplace preventive measures are established—with physical distancing, handwashing facilities, and respiratory etiquette in place.

Enforcing safety measures in private settings will be a challenge. We are very skeptical that employers, when faced with the increased costs of implementing safety measures, will comply with them, particularly where marginalized populations (including the undocumented) are concerned. Moreover, the gating criteria simply do not address this problem at the outset, rather leaving it for later in the process.

5. That importation risks can be managed.

The gating criteria say nothing about importation risks with respect to international, interstate, or intrastate importation.

6. That communities have a voice and are engaged in the transition.

In our federalism, the states as primary actors may or may not take the voices in their communities into account. Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act is the most recent example of this failure to take into account multiple voices, and that experience appears to demonstrate the improbability at local, state, and federal levels of sufficient attention being paid to the interests of all the communities that will be engaged in the transition. We wish we were not such pessimists, but having seen how the American polity operates, we are hesitant to have confidence. Take for one example, Flint, Michigan.

Taking all of these items together, the fear is that at the end of the day, there will be more dead and dying and these mechanisms for rationalizing indifference to that dying will be invoked as “neutral” criteria that lead the re-opening. This type of rationalization is an old process in American politics where the form is respected and the substance is minimized. The argument will be focused on the intent of the guidelines and not on their effect because we tend not to like having governmental action looked at for its effect.

So we fear for our fellow Americans and all residents, documented or undocumented, if this policy is followed. We fear there will be much more death and too much rationalization of that death. Especially if it is primarily among the elderly, the poor, the black and the brown.

We worry about the treatment of people like commodities in this response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is going on with these guidelines is nothing more or less than setting up a blame-shifting device if things go wrong. Propose guidelines. Have experts approve them. When things go wrong, blame the guidelines. Or blame the state and local authorities for not collecting the data needed to make the guidelines work.

What a people-first procedure would do is create a generous margin of error to absorb risks. It is not clear that that has been done here. There is, in essence, an acceptable level of loss among certain classes who are measured (and less concern about other classes for which measurement is more problematic). We do not have a problem with measurement in the abstract, which must be done—but with the parameters set and the resources for implementation.

It is not clear what the hospital category has to say about ventilator availability as a function of acute cases: one would have thought this to have been a clear metric of importance given all the attention paid to this by governors. Is that idea of a cushion in equipment part of the hospital column when one drills down?

We may be looking at this in a rush, but would a proper metric not include some ratio or cushion for essential supplies on hand in the area to address a spike that occurs later (some metric that measures masks, gloves, ventilators, beds, a healthy doctor/patient and nurse/patient ratio)?

Of course, while ideologically unpleasant for some, the alternative approach for the COVID-19 pandemic vulnerable could be expanded governmental support until the health crisis is clearly overcome. That cost would no doubt be significant, but arguably a relatively small price to pay as compared to the costs of a premature reopening of the economy. The important point is to understand that such an approach would not be one that denounced capitalism but would rather be one that separates capitalism from one or another ideology of capitalism (e.g., Thomas Piketty, Capitalism and Ideology) and its effects. There are many ways to channel capitalism in a health crisis. Just like during the Great Depression, capitalism had to adjust in light of dramatic unemployment. We face at least that kind of danger today and solutions like these guidelines that mask the underlying health crisis are not going to get us out of this horrible mess.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In January 2020, the federal cabinet of Pakistan approved the <a href="https://thecurrent.pk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CP-Against-Online-Harm-Rules-2019-updated-1.pdf">Citizen</a>’s Protection (Against Online Harm) Rules to regulate social media platforms for streaming content related to terrorism, extremism, hate speech, sedition, fake news, defamation, violence, and national security.

Pakistan is not the first country that has attempted to regulate social media platforms. Countries such as Egypt, China, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and several others already have stringent laws to regulate media. This law, in consonance with the laws of these other nations, is meant to curb all forms of extremism, which is defined under Section 2(d) of the Rules as,
<blockquote>“violent, vocal or active opposition of the state of Pakistan including the security, integrity or defense of Pakistan, public order, decency or morality, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.”</blockquote>
While this move is supported by some <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/613419-cant-leave-social-media-companies-completely-unregulated-dr-firdous-awan">people</a> to identify and weed out unwanted and slanderous online content to uphold the integrity, decency, and respect of individuals and organizations, there has been significant <a href="https://aicasia.org/2020/02/13/aic-media-statement-pakistans-citizens-protection-rules-against-online-harm-2020-13-feb-2020/">backlash</a> generated because the rules are potentially disastrous and stifling.

The rules are <a href="https://joshandmakinternational.com/resources/laws-of-pakistan/telecommunications-telecoms-laws-of-pakistan/the-pakistan-telecommunication-re-organization-amendment-act-2006/">promulgated</a> under the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organisation) Act and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (<a href="http://ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/104952/128187/F424540000/PAK104952.pdf">PECA</a>) which imposes numerous requirements on social media platforms to comply with the order to fulfill the demands of the Rules. According to Section 1(2) of the Rules, these would come into force “at once,” which in itself is problematic as the social media platforms would have to deal with the changes impromptu, without a transition period being granted to them.

To look upon the compliance of the changes and centralize the regulations, the post of National Coordinator is established under Section 3 of the Rules. According to the section, the Coordinator is given the power to curb the content that violates the law. This includes identification and deletion of impertinent content circulated over social media platforms, cloud-based application platforms, and other online platforms. The Coordinator can also acquire problematic data or any other information from social media companies. He or she can also direct the representatives of the platforms on behalf of the government of Pakistan to appear before it.

While the rules set up a powerful <span>post, the qualifications, accountability, and selection procedure of the National Coordinator remain questioned. Search and seizure of data without the measures for questioning the authority concerns the privacy of the companies and people. It is pertinent to mention here that PECA permits the Pakistan Telecommunication Agency (PTA) to seek the removal of online content through agencies mentioned under Section 29. The act also establishes a proper legal oversight concerning the unauthorized acts of the agencies. The Rules, however, fail to specify sufficient safeguarding measures against the power of the National Coordinator, which is ultra vires to the provisions of the PECA. Furthermore, these rules impose onerous obligations on service providers to filter out ‘unlawful content’ on their platforms even though the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act specifically proscribes any obligations on these platforms, especially for the user-generated content, such as ‘live streaming,’ as mentioned in Section 38 of PECA. </span>

In addition to the concerns raised by the powers of the national coordinator, significant problems are presented by the period given to the social media platforms for removing the content found to be illegal by the PTA or the National Coordinator. Section 4 of the Rules instructs the platforms to remove, suspend or disable the content within twenty-four hours, and within six hours in case of an emergency. It is to be noted that the vague and arbitrary provisions of the section are an overreach of the restrictions that are imposed on the Right to Freedom of Speech guaranteed under <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of Pakistan. The deletion of data on the “Instructions of the National Coordinator” contravenes the purposes of the r<span>estrictions under the Constitution. The restrictions on the freedom of speech must be <a href="http://www.isca.in/IJSS/Archive/v7/i6/3.ISCA-IRJSS-2017-137.pdf">reasonable</a>, or following the law and not according to the whims and wishes of the National Coordinator.</span>

In the case <em>Saiyid Abul A ’la Maudoodi and Others. v. The Government of West Pakistan</em>, the court held that access to justice is a basic fundamental right for all the citizens and a restriction imposed on the right to freedom of speech will be unreasonable if necessary safeguards are not provided against the arbitrary exercise of the power. However, Section 4(2) places the Coordinator above any community standards, rules, or guidelines, which violates individuals' rights.

Moreover, Section 4(4) of the Rules state:
<blockquote>A Social Media Company shall deploy proactive mechanisms to ensure prevention of live streaming through Online Systems in Pakistan of any content in violation of any law, rule, regulation for the time being in force or instruction of the National Coordinator particularly regarding online content related to terrorism, extremism, hate speech, defamation, fake news, incitement to violence and national security.</blockquote>
It is to be noted that a majority of terms mentioned in the section are vague, subjective and undefined, resulting in innocent people being roped in with the ones who are not. Due to the lack of clarity, the companies may feel obliged to remove legitimate content to protect themselves from any sanctions.

All in all, the move to curb the online content of social media platforms is inherently threatening to several rights guaranteed to the citizens. It is not only taking away the rights of the people but also the benefits that the digital world offers. It remains to be seen whether the government of Pakistan will bring much-needed reform to these rules.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Curbing global pandemics like COVID-19 has been one of the most difficult tasks in the history of mankind. The emergence of this virus can be traced back to December of 2019 when China alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan. However, the virus remained <span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/timeline-china-coronavirus-spread-200126061554884.html">unknown</a></span> at this stage. Only later was it was identified and <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-2019-ncov-on-11-february-2020">named</a> COVID-19 by WHO. The outbreak was <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen">declared</a> a public health emergency of international concern.

Amidst this chaos, there has been misinformation and rumors have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/4/21156607/how-did-the-coronavirus-get-started-china-wuhan-lab">surfacing</a> on social media, the most prominent among them being conspiracy theories regarding the use of COVID-19 as a bioweapon by China. In one version of the rumor, the virus was engineered in a lab by humans as a bioweapon. In another <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/">version</a>, the virus was being studied in the lab (after being isolated from animals) and then “escaped” or “leaked” because of poor safety protocol. The fact that Wuhan <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/News/Events/201502/t20150203_135923.html">has</a> the only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, the National Biosafety Laboratory (part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology) further reinforces this theory. However, all these rumors lack scientific evidence to support this <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2020/03/china-is-legally-responsible-for-covid-19-damage-and-claims-could-be-in-the-trillions/">conspiracy</a> theory.

Based on this theory, Freedom Watch <a href="https://www.freedomwatchusa.org/pdf/200330-Complaint%20Before%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court%20.pdf">filed</a> a lawsuit against Chinese authorities in the US over coronavirus outbreak. The plaintiff <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/current/world/usd-20-trillion-lawsuit-against-china-us-group-says-coronavirus-bioweapon/story/399071.html">seeks</a> $20 trillion, a more than China's GDP, claiming coronavirus is the result of a <span><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/biological-weapons#tab=tab_1">biological weapon</a></span> prepared by the Chinese authorities. The plaintiff also alleged that all the defendants were working together to perpetrate an act of  "international terrorism".

<strong><u>Issue of Jurisdiction </u></strong>

Traditionally, US citizens were permitted to sue a foreign state if it was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism by the US, provided that they were harmed by that state's aid for international terrorism. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act  (<span><a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s2040/text">JASTA</a></span><span>)</span> authorized the federal courts to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a state's support for acts of international terrorism against a US national or property regardless of whether such a state is designated as a sponsor of terrorism. Such types of cases are not new in the legal history of the US. This trend came into the limelight after the case <a href="https://casetext.com/case/in-re-terrorist-attacks-on-september-11-24">In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001</a>, wherein the JASTA was applied for the first time.

As per Section <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-114s2040enr/pdf/BILLS-114s2040enr.pdf">1605B(b)</a> of the JASTA, a foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a US court in cases where money damages are sought against it for physical injury to a person, property or death occurring in the US caused by either an act of international <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331">terrorism</a> or by a tortious act performed by any agent or official of that state, regardless of the place where it is performed.

Freedom Watch’s petition has addressed the question of jurisdiction in a detailed manner and might be admissible in the court.

There have been prior cases wherein a state was held liable for an act of international terrorism and paid hefty damages to the victims. The best example is the case of <a href="https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/6/issue/2/lockerbie-trial-verdict">Pan Am 103 Bombing</a> wherein, according to the evidence, the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/pan-am-103-bombing">involvement</a> of two Libyan intelligence operatives was proven and one of them was found guilty. Initially, the Libyan government did not agree to extradite both of the operatives. Libya finally agreed after being pressured from the Security Council by way of imposing sanctions until the country to compensated the victims' families and demonstrated with concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism. Later, the Libyan Government also paid a sum of nearly $3 billion to the victims’ families.

However, unlike the <u>Pan Am 103</u> case, the issues involved in Freedom Watch’s petition still require investigation. Furthermore, the lack of any scientific evidence to support the theory of using COVID-19 as a bioweapon indicates that these are mere theoretical presumptions and are not practically possible as COVID-19 is not fatal enough to be used as a bioweapon. Secondly, the involvement of two nuclear weapons states (<span><a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat">NWS</a></span>) in this case which have been involved in a trade war appears to be a mere act of predominance.

<strong><u>Further Course of Action and International Overview</u></strong>

<span>This Freedom Watch petition might be admissible by the court, but what if China, being a superpower, refuses to comply with the decision of the court in order to protect its sovereign immunity? As mentioned above the petition might be rejected on the basis of lack of evidence. Therefore, alternative discourses may be necessary to bring China under proper jurisdiction and make them accountable for allegedly committing such a heinous and negligent act.</span><span> </span>

<strong><u> Alternative Course of Action Available in International Forums </u></strong>

<span>Considering the fact that this pandemic has affected more than half of the world’s population, it might be best to bring an <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Article 7</a> Crimes Against Humanities case against the Chinese authorities in the International Criminal Court (<a href="https://www.globalpolicy.org/international-justice/the-international-criminal-court.html">ICC</a>). The ICC is the supreme authority to handle such cases.  It is undoubtedly a better alternative to make Chinese authorities responsible for the outbreak. </span><span> </span>

<span>In the case of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/drc/katanga">The Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga</a><u>,</u> the alleged party was convicted and sentenced to twelve years of prison for committing mass murder and various crimes against humanity. The recent <a href="https://www.opindia.com/2020/03/china-unsc-un-security-council-block-discussion-draft-coronavirus-covid-19-transparency/">incident</a> where China used its veto power to refuse to allow the discussion of the Wuhan epidemic and the spread of COVID-19 in the Security Council has created several questions. The Chinese Ambassador stated that “discussion relating to COVID-19 is not an agenda of the UNSC”, which has led to further the suspicion that China is hiding vital details about the origin of the virus. </span>

It may be <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/09/truth-coronavirus-china-trump-pence/">inferred</a> that <span>China is covering up the issue, which itself is a grave and inhumane act during this pandemic. Thus, even if there exists a remote suspicion that China has deliberately used COVID-19 as a biological weapon for committing bio-terrorism, there must be a proper trial held and every suspected authority must be a party.</span><span> </span>

The People’s Republic of China, <span>Major General Chen Wie and Shi Zhengli, Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, are the defendants in the Freedom Watch petition. The defendants dealt with the handling of the virus during the pre-pandemic and must be subject to proper investigation. If China is found to guilty of the deliberate release of COVID-19 during the investigation, there would be violations of several treaties China is a party to: </span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>The <a href="http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/bwc/text">Convention</a> on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction: This convention clearly states that the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons in any manner against mankind would lead to a violation of the treaty. As per the treaty, any party can draw an action against the alleged party in UNSC along with the evidence stated under Article 7.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><span><a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/280">Protocol</a> for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare: This treaty prohibits the use of any bacteriological method for mass destruction of mankind.</span></li>

<strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong>

The present COVID-19 pandemic has led to serious physical sufferings and mental injury accompanied by damage to the global economy and to man-kind. The proper judicial mechanisms must provide justice to the aggrieved party and convict the culprits behind the conspiracy if it exists. There are also alternatives available in international forums. The only factor which remains in this puzzle is the proper evidence proving such a conspiracy exists. Once a proper investigation is initiated, things will become more clear. However, the behavior of the Chinese government is alarming and appears to be suspicious.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Britain is a country of animal lovers and has a long <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Animal+Welfare+Law+in+Britain:+Regulation+and+Responsibility&amp;author=M.+Radford&amp;publication_year=2001&amp;">history</a> of spearheading animal protection measures with global reach. This history can be traced back to 1822 with the introduction of Martin’s Act. The Brambell Report of 1965 and the UK joining forces with European Communities, the predecessor to the EU, in 1973 were major milestones. Brambell's five freedoms have been the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10806-012-9434-7">foundation </a>of legislation concerning animal welfare around the world; in 1999, the UK used its presidency of the EU to press for the adoption of a protocol that regarded animals as "sentient" and not just as agricultural "goods."

The UK has been a front-runner in developing EU laws concerning animal protection, often called a "beacon for animal welfare" in the EU. However, something is set to change post-Brexit. There are enormous consequences for humans and non-humans alike. The UK can remain the world leader in animal welfare only by maintaining its progressive animal protection reforms and simultaneously maintaining high baseline standards concerning its agricultural policy.

This article will assess the threats, as well as opportunities available for animal protection post-Brexit.
<h4>The Increasing Threat to Farmed and Wild Animals</h4>
Steven McCulloch has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6262562/">argued</a> that the impact on farmed animals will determine Brexit's overall effect on animal protection, whether favorable or adverse. The reasons were quite clear. The UK's departure from the EU placed it outside the block's Common Agricultural Policy, allowing the UK to craft its own agricultural policies that either favor animal welfare or allow for lower standards, the choices brought on by Brexit will have a major impact on animal welfare across the globe.

The UK in response introduced its landmark "<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/landmark-agriculture-bill-to-deliver-a-green-brexit">Agricultural Bill</a>" intending to deliver a "green Brexit" in 2018. Setting aside all the positives that this bill brings about for the UK’s agricultural transition in 2021, the bill still does not talk about how animal imports that fail to meet animal welfare standards will be prevented.

This can be understood as the UK’s window of opportunity to sign a free trade deal with the US. It is not clear whether such an agreement would force US producers to raise and match their standards to the UK's or, given the UK's desperation to sign a post-Brexit trade deal, be signed without adequate animal welfare measures. The latter would result in UK farmers having to compete against low-welfare imports. This regulatory burden and the slowdown in trade measures related to animal welfare are already noticeable, following the path of "Global Britain."

A more contemporary example of how farm animals are being abused can be drawn from the recent outbreak of COVID-19, which has resulted in the transport of animals not complying with EU law. The new EU <a href="https://www.eureporter.co/frontpage/2020/03/20/farm-animals-suffer-at-eu-borders-due-to-coronavirus-response-says-compassion-in-world-farming/">guidelines </a>for border management completely disregard both the well-being of farm animals and public health by allowing long border delays with no food, no water and no place to rest. This inhumane trade involving live animals utterly disrespects animal welfare and poses a significant threat to both animals and humans.

Also related to wildlife welfare, the upcoming threat to the "precautionary principle" involving wild habitats is of utmost concern. The present EU withdrawal bill omits the precautionary principle, which demands industry actors prove that their actions will not harm wildlife or their habitats. This means that unless the UK government gives effect to the precautionary principle by way of a new law, the withdrawal bill will certainly rip the heart out of environmental law including Brexit’s role in animal conservation and development.
<h4>International Trade Law, a Solution?</h4>
One of the biggest post-Brexit <a href="https://www.keithtaylormep.org.uk/sites/default/files/download/2019-01/Keith-Taylor-MEP-Animals-and-Brexit-Report-2018.pdf">threats</a> to animal welfare in the UK is free trade agreements (FTAs). Leaving the EU will mean leaving the single market. The UK, then, faces the problem of re-negotiating all the existing FTAs it had enjoyed as part of the EU. The EU has ensured a high degree of uniformity in animal trade and protections for animal welfare. It is now incumbent upon the UK to maintain consistency and high standards and evade the danger of low animal welfare protections in the new FTAs.

The Trans Pacific Partnership's <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Final-Text-Environment.pdf">chapter</a> on the environment has been a ray of light so far as trade and animal welfare law go. Such new forms of international cooperation to protect animals, including model provisions on trade and sustainable development and conditional liberalization of EU standards, will surely encourage future FTAs to adopt high animal welfare standards.
<h4>Suggestive Measures</h4>
The following steps can be taken to ensure that animal welfare is not compromised post-Brexit:

UK farmers and land managers must be adequately incentivized and compensated by way of farm incentive schemes enabling catchment sensitive farming and improving the lives of farmed animals and their environment. The UK Agricultural Bill is worth mentioning in this regard. The government should secure the inclusion of high farm animal welfare <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldeucom/15/1510.htm">standards</a> in the future FTAs. This step can be supported by import restrictions and by exploring recent developments in WTO law on animal welfare.

A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/50587148">ban</a> on live animal exports for slaughter and animals used for testing and research is of utmost importance. The monitoring must not be weakened by the Home Office on animal testing and research that causes needless suffering and pain to animals. Additionally, the illegal trade of wild animals must be prohibited and taken care of by way of intelligence sharing across borders and implementing the EU trafficking programs.

So far as companion animals are concerned, a highly qualified veterinary team must be appointed along with the required veterinary medicines so that the animal health profession is not hampered post-Brexit. It is pertinent to note that, vets play a crucial role in also testing and certifying farm animals for trade.

The ‘precautionary principle’ must be duly <a href="https://www.newnetworksfornature.org.uk/blog/where-is-the-precautionary-principle">incorporated</a> into UK legislation and the existing wildlife legislation must be modified to maintain high standards of animal protection and conservation.

To ensure higher animal protection standards, Green members of the European Parliament have constantly insisted on "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/13/green-guarantee-brexit-eu-environmental-protection-law">green guarantees</a>" which will provide protectionist measures and safeguard the lives of animals globally. These guarantees must be effectively and efficiently implemented.

Reinventing farming subsidies or going with the Common Agricultural Policy to provide financial support to farmers must be a priority for the UK. Financial support should be directed toward those who maintain high animal welfare standards and should not go to those with low animal welfare and environmental standards or those promoting slaughter and illicit trade. Future FTAs must not undermine developments and progress made, so far as sustainable farming methods and improved animal welfare are concerned.

Last, but not the least, the animal welfare laws must be improved constantly. Animals must still be recognized as "sentient beings," and animal welfare science and recent developments in animal law must be duly recognized and further legislated for animal well-being. The hard-fought and ambitious animal protection laws must be protected. The UK should maintain its reputation as a"champion of animal welfare."
<h4>How Can the EU Help?</h4>
History tells us that the EU has among the world’s highest animal welfare <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/animal-welfare">standards</a>. Amidst the strong outcry not to water down animal protection laws post-Brexit, the environment secretary Michael Gove <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-animal-welfare-protection-sentience-eu-law-survey-a8787041.html">promised</a> "animal sentience" would be recognized and strengthened in new legislation. Still, there is a lot more that the UK can do in concert with the EU.

Puppy smuggling is a growing problem. The UK's Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee <a href="https://cutt.ly/1t6FtMY">inquired</a> into puppy smuggling in 2019. The withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU can affect the UK’s options for puppy smuggling.

The import of foie gras and its sale under the free movement of goods principle has not been prevented by the EU, despite prohibitions against its production in much of Europe. The UK could <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/foie-gras-ban-new-york-animal-cruelty-uk-eu-food-rights-a8771086.html">ban</a> its import with the help of the EU. Additionally, post-Brexit <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-animal-welfare-protection-sentience-eu-law-survey-a8787041.html">deals</a> could allow for the caging of laying hens, the leaving of ducks without bathing water, and for the import of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated dairy products. Most importantly, the current Animal Welfare Act of 2006 does not cover "free-living wildlife."

While the UK will be signing trade deals as a more independent nation post-Brexit, there will be more potential and influence at the international level if UK policy continues to align with EU policy. Otherwise, animal welfare will be negatively impacted. This complements conditional liberalization which falls in line with the <a href="https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/animal-welfare-top-mind-eurobarometer-2016">Eurobarometer</a> study on animal welfare, a rallying cry for animal protection.

Brexit provides substantial prospects for animal welfare reform in the UK. The government needs to commit to a progressive agenda when it comes to the trade and import of animal and animal products to have a positive impact on animal protection around the world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"The earth from which the first man was made was gathered in all the four corners of the world." -<em>The Talmud</em></blockquote>
Amid growing horrors of the Coronavirus, it is easy to forget a very basic human lesson: <em>We are all creatures of biology</em>. By extrapolation, we are all stunningly fragile, closely interrelated and irremediably interdependent. Among other concerns, it will be vital for us to understand that human survival is literally incompatible with the traditional norms of belligerent nationalism.

Significantly, however, US President Donald Trump derived his hugely destructive "America First" posture directly from such time-discredited norms.

Now, what we require most urgently and desperately - both America and the wider world - is a conspicuously broad expansion of human empathy. Though such a commendable ambition to supplant "everyone for himself" national strategies with more durable policies of human compassion will at first appear silly, idealistic or utopian, nothing would be further from the truth. To recall the unlikely but still-illuminating wisdom of Italian film director Federico Fellini, "The visionary is the only realist."

None of this is really bewildering. To survive as a species, especially at this fearful time of worldwide plague and economic dislocation, all nations should immediately reject the defiling notion that human beings can somehow coexist or progress amid endless competitive struggles. The evidence is incontestable. Historically, policies of "all against all" have never succeeded.

Never.

In world politics and law, all this signifies a now overriding obligation to replace the destabilizing ethos of perpetual conflict with one of a more genuine human cooperation. More specifically, in the United States, it means a very tangible responsibility to discard "America First" in absolutely any and all of its pernicious and "<a style="cursor: help" title="For the political philosophy origins of 'Realism,' see especially the classic comment of Thrasymachus in Bk. 1, Sec. 338 of Plato, The Republic: 'Right is the interest of the stronger.' See also, by Professor Louis René Beres, America Outside the World: The Collapse of US Foreign Policy (Lexington Mass., Lexington Books, 1987) and Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: US Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington Mass., Lexington Books, 1984)">realism-based</a>" implications.

Such evident truths notwithstanding, the American president continues to move precariously in opposite directions. Donald Trump's recent <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/04/trump-announces-freeze-on-who-funding-while-us-reviews-organization/">announcement</a> of US funding withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) - a deeply injurious assault on global health <a style="cursor: help" title="In stark contrast, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of WHO, spoke modestly, intelligently and purposefully: 'COVID-19 does not discriminate between rich nations and poor, large nations and small. It does not discriminate between nationalities, ethnicities, or ideologies. Neither do we,' he said. 'This is a time for all of us to be united in our common struggle against a common threat, a dangerous enemy. When we're divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us.'">cooperation</a> at the worst possible time - expressed <em>de facto</em> derivation from "America First." In this latest manifestation of US belligerent nationalism, Trump did nothing less than undermine already-diminishing global prospects for overcoming Covid-19. That he was not especially bothered by creating such significant harms is hardly out-of-character. Unleashing on a beleaguered WHO was fully consistent with Trump's wittingly codified anti-health stance in US domestic politics.

To wit, on April 16, 2020 this "everyone for himself" president urged a weakening of formerly-binding federal <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/04/epa-rolls-back-mercury-regulations/">regulations</a> regarding mercury and other toxic metals released from oil and coal-fired plants. How could it get much worse?

There is more. Antecedent to any much-needed US policy transformations, the American president himself should seek to display certain recognizable gestures of human empathy and caring. For the moment, however, this remains a tall and implausible order, one that could appear by its very nature to be inconceivable.

Considering Donald Trump's far-reaching and steadfast expressions of manifest unconcern for human life and dignity generally, America will likely continue with its own markedly dramatic declensions at almost every observable level. With this president's breathtaking venality (for blatant example, consider Trump's incessant and contrived references to the Coronavirus as the "China Virus"), expecting any expanded empathy from the White House would seem to be an utterly vain hope. For Americans led by such a crude and unfeeling president, an accelerating downward trajectory seems all but assured.

Yet, even in Trump's badly beaten-down America, reason and rationality should warrant at least some residual pride of place. Understood in pertinent legal, intellectual or analytic terms, the gratuitous rancor of belligerent US nationalism makes no calculable sense. Indeed, on its face, this corrosive sentiment continuously undermines the most elementary and indispensable wisdom concerning reciprocal human interests and welfare.

Rather than further stiffen its misconceived resolve for scapegoating failed policies of "America First" - together with deliberate falsifications, deflection has already become a key hallmark of the Trump presidency - the United States must change direction.

Dramatically.

In essence, America must retreat from President Trump's refractory postures of blaming others for its multiple ills, preparing instead for incrementally expanding patterns of some more genuine international cooperation. As humans, we remain, after all, virtually identical manifestations of a common organismic inheritance. <em>In the end, we are all creatures of biology</em>.

It's not complicated. Before we can look forward realistically to some reassuringly long-term national survival, we will first have to acknowledge that we all inhabit a single and indissoluble global habitat. Unmistakably, the alternative Trump vision of securing progress via policies of protracted belligerence can only lead the United States toward cumulative and irreversible catastrophe. Among other things, this would mean an endlessly Darwinian global struggle for existence, a zero-sum world in which tens of millions of Americans would inevitably suffer one form or another of violent death.

Even more palpably, this Trump vision would sustain a consuming and utterly retrograde pattern of conflict, one in which the inherently embittering principles of "America First" would produce additional increments of chaos and, as corollary, a near-perpetual pattern of suffering.

It's not bewildering. Until now, in virtually every sector of human relations, both national and international, the term "against" has become the operative policy word descending from the White House. In all such fearfully ubiquitous matters, microcosm nurtures the macrocosm. Accordingly, for US President Donald Trump, world politics is conveniently reducible to endless bitter struggles against one prominently despised enemy or another.

In historical context, this reduction reveals a uniquely Trump-version of <em>Mein Kampf</em>, or "My Struggle," an image that is <em>ipso facto</em> dark and worrisome. Moreover, such grotesquely portentous thinking is not "merely" crude and unjust; it is also analytically/intellectually misconceived and inexcusably foolish.

In coherent summation, such thinking is contrary to all elementary and essential codes of civilized human <a style="cursor: help" title="Nonetheless, for the moment at least, international law or the 'Westphalian' law of nations remains a basically vigilante system. The historic reference here is to the Peace Of Westphalia (1648), which concluded the Thirty Years War, and created the now still-existing decentralized, or balance-of-power state system. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.">interactions</a>.

To be sure, there are available much better paths to human coexistence on this fragile and interdependent planet. In order to help rescue America from an expanding configuration of truly mortal dangers - including the dreaded onset of new or additional disease "plagues" - Trump will first need to envision our imperiled planet as a whole. Above all, this insistently defiling American president will somehow need to avoid having to deal piecemeal or <em>ad hoc</em> with the next inevitable eruptions of pandemic, and also of genocide, <a style="cursor: help" title="For assessment of probable consequences of nuclear war fighting, by this author, see: Louis René Beres, Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; 2nd. ed., 2018); Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (Lexington MA: Lexington Books, 1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: US Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington MA; Lexington Books, 1984); and Louis René Beres, ed., Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Lexington MA: Lexington Books, 1986)">nuclear war</a> and/or terror. For all such intersecting perils, he should already have in place a suitable theory or science-based plan, one with corresponding law-enforcing components.

Theory is a "net." Only those who cast, can <a style="cursor: help" title="At the same time, we cannot be allowed to forget that theoretical fruitfulness must be achieved at some more-or-less tangible cost of 'dehumanization.' As Goethe reminds us is Urfaust, the original Faust fragment: 'All theory, dear friend, is grey, And the golden tree of life is green.' Translated here by the author, from the German: 'Grau, theurer Freund, ist alle Theorie, Und grun des Lebens goldner Baum.'">catch</a>.

There is more. Intellect can inform empathy. By embracing "high-thinking" instead of incoherent rally slogans and vacant banalities, Trump could finally have to acknowledge that American well-being and security are inextricably linked with the much wider "human condition." In the best of all possible worlds, this expectedly reluctant recognition will take him some additional time; plausibly, far more than is still available. Trump will also need to embrace another even more subtle kind of survival understanding.

This expectation is that desired social and governmental linkages need not necessarily present themselves in readily decipherable terms, whether legal, historical or economic.

Though plausibly fanciful, <em>now</em> is the only suitable moment for Donald Trump and his deluded acolytes to recall the wisdom of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin: "The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of `everyone for himself','" <a style="cursor: help" title="In law, this sort of thinking gives rise to a corresponding jurisprudential obligation. Says Emmerich de Vattel, in his The Law of Nations (1758), 'The first general law, which is to be found in the very end of the society of Nations, is that each Nation should contribute as far as it can to the happiness and advancement of other Nations.'">explains</a> the Jesuit philosopher in <em>The Phenomenon of Man</em>, "is false and against nature. No element can move and grow except with and by all the others with itself."

The "<a style="cursor: help" title="This term is central to the 19th century American Transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson's classical writings. Back then, Emerson (and also Henry David Thoreau) had urged an American life of 'plain living and high thinking.'">high-thinking</a>" Teilhard was right on the mark. At their very deepest levels, genocide, war, and terror are not just the avoidable product of <a style="cursor: help" title="In essence, the concept of a balance of power has never been more than a facile metaphor. Further, it has never had anything to do with any calculable equilibrium. As such a balance is always a matter of individual and more-or-less subjective perceptions, adversary states may never be sufficiently confident that strategic circumstances are sufficiently 'balanced' in their favor. In consequence, as each side must perpetually fear that it will be 'left behind,' the search for balance continually produces only wider insecurity and disequilibrium.">balance-of-power</a> world politics gone awry. Instead, they stem from the usually unbearable apprehensions and persistent loneliness of individual human beings.

There is more. Normally unable to find either meaning or safety outside of certain available group memberships, billions of individuals across the globe still stop at nothing in order to acquire comforting measures of acceptance within a warmly protective "<a style="cursor: help" title="'The crowd,' says the 19th century Danish philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard, 'is untruth.'">crowd</a>."

All such crowds, whether encountered at Trump rallies or certain 1930s European mass gatherings, love to chant in unthinking chorus. Viscerally. What is injurious and most notably grotesque about such politically orchestrated mutterings is not just the dissembling content being chanted (this is "normally" incoherent and also often insidious), but the accompanying disappearance of personal empathy and private responsibility.

In one manifestation or another, the dissembling crowd is pretty much ubiquitous in human affairs. Whether constituted as a nation, a social organization, a terrorist band, or some energized political movement, it systematically tempts the "all-too-many" (a favored Nietzschean term in his <em>Zarathustra</em>) with the deceptively false succor of reliable group communion. Always, this ultimately sordid temptation lies at the heart of a mob's ritually compelling and seemingly incomparable attractions. Typically, though rarely identified or understood, it is the generally frantic human search <em>to belong</em> that most assiduously shapes both national and international affairs.

With "America First," US President Donald Trump exploits and degrades this ill-fated search.

Unsurprisingly, as the seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes <a style="cursor: help" title="The condition of Hobbesian anarchy stands in stark contrast to the legal assumption of solidarity between states. In essence, this jurisprudential assumption concerns a presumptively common struggle against aggression in all its forms. Such a 'peremptory' expectation, known formally in law as a jus cogens assumption, was already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE); Hugo Grotius, 2 De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres, Ch. 20 (Francis W. Kesey., tr, Clarendon Press, 1925)(1690); and Emmerich de Vattel, 1 Le Droit Des Gens, Ch. 19 (1758).">concluded</a> about "state of nature" crowds in his Leviathan, mob fears portend a sorely lamentable life, one that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." In the eighteenth century, the Founding Fathers of the United States were well-versed in Hobbes, and also with philosophers Locke, Vattel, Grotius, Rousseau and Montesquieu. Now, in 2020, in starkly abysmal contrast, an American president takes abundantly great pride in reading nothing, literally nothing at all.

For the sake of America and the wider world, it is time to situate at least a scintilla of "high thinking" in the White House. The irrepressible human search to belong, to expand a useful term central to Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung's <em>The Undiscovered Self</em>, represents "the sum total of individual souls seeking redemption." Jurisprudentially and diplomatically, the most tangible expressions of our incessant human search for rescue in groups can be found in the core legal principles of <em>sovereignty</em> and <em>self-determination</em>.

To be sure, an American president who presently declares that he "alone" has "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-13/trump-declares-he-has-power-to-open-up-states-not-governors">final authority</a>" over the United States has not an inkling of either history or <a style="cursor: help" title="Significantly, though wholly disregarded by President Trump, international law is part of United States jurisprudence. In the words of Mr. Justice Gray, delivering the judgment of the US Supreme Court in Paquete Habana (1900): 'International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction....' (175 U.S. 677(1900)) See also: Opinion in Tel-Oren vs. Libyan Arab Republic (726 F. 2d 774 (1984)). Moreover, the specific incorporation of treaty law into US municipal law is expressly codified at Art. 6 of the US Constitution, the so-called 'Supremacy Clause.'">law</a>. Not only has Trump never read any of the philosophic and legal foundations of the United States, he has never read the US Constitution - not even a cursory glance. How could this once-unimaginable failure be acceptable to millions of American citizens? In part, it is because these many millions place absolutely no value upon learning themselves.

Divided into thousands of hostile tribes, almost two hundred of which are called "nation-states," too many human beings still find it easy and pleasing to slay "others." As for any prospectively remediating considerations of empathy, these are reserved largely for those who happen to live within one’s own expressly delineated "tribe." It follows, and crucially, that some American expansion of empathy to include "outsiders" must be antecedent to any meaningful enhancements of world peace and biological safety.

However unwitting, without such indispensable expansion, the American nation would remain stubbornly and suicidally dedicated to its own incremental debasement and eventual disappearance.

As quickly as possible, understanding this particular wisdom should become a palpable corrective to "America First." But what must Americans (and also others) actually <em>do</em> to encourage a wider and reciprocal empathy, thereby to foster aptly caring feelings between as well as within "tribes"? These are not easy questions. Still, they are the ones that need to be faced by Americans and (ultimately) by all others.

Already, soberly and ironically, we must concede that the essential expansion of empathy for the many could become dreadful, improving human community, but only at the intolerable cost of private sanity. This imperative concession would stem from the way we humans are "designed" or "hard wired," that is, with very particular and largely impermeable boundaries of feeling. Were it otherwise, an extended range of compassion toward all others could bring about each cooperating individual's own emotional collapse.

A paradox arises. Planning seriously for national and international survival, Americans in particular must first learn to accept an unorthodox sort of understanding. It is that an ever-widening circle of human compassion is indispensable to civilizational survival, but is also a potential source of an insufferable private anguish.

How, then, shall international law, human union and American politics now deal with a requirement for global <a style="cursor: help" title="Still, Dostoyevsky inquires about civilization: 'What is it in us that is mellowed by civilization? All it does, I’d say, is to develop in man a capacity to feel a greater variety of sensations. And nothing, absolutely nothing else. And through this development, man will yet learn how to enjoy bloodshed. Why, it has already happened….Civilization has made man, if not always more bloodthirsty, at least more viciously, more horribly bloodthirsty.' See: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Notes From Underground 108 (Andrew R. MacAndrew, trans., New American Library, 1961)(1862).">civilization</a> that is both essential and unbearable? Newly informed that empathy for the many is a precondition of a decent world union, what could actually create such an obligatory caring without simultaneously producing intolerable emotional pain? In essence, high-thinkers must duly inquire: <em>How can such a stunningly anti-intellectual and rancorous US president deal correctly with ongoing and still-multiplying expressions of pandemic, war, terrorism, and genocide?</em>

By building walls, or by solidifying wide-ranging and always-needed bonds of human interrelatedness and connectedness?

It's not a trick question. The answer is perfectly obvious. Correct answers can never be found in banal political speeches and propagandistic programs, especially in the cravenly shallow rhetoric and embarrassingly empty witticisms of Donald Trump. They are discoverable only in a consciously resolute detachment of individuals from lethally competitive "tribes" and from certain other corrosively collective “selves.”

In the final analysis, a more perfect union, both national and international, must lie in some fully determined replacement of “civilization” with what Teilhard de Chardin calls “<a style="cursor: help" title="Earlier, in this very same spirit, Sigmund Freud entered an opinion: 'Wars will only be prevented with certainty if mankind unites in setting up a central authority to which the right of giving judgment upon all shall be handed over. There are clearly two separate requirements involved in this: the creation of a supreme agency and its endowment with the necessary power. One without the other would be useless.' See: Sigmund Freud, Collected Papers, cited in Louis René Beres, The Management of World Power: A Theoretical Analysis, University of Denver, Monograph Series in World Affairs, Vol. 10 (1973-73), p, 27. Albert Einstein held very similar views. See, for example: Otto Nathan et al. eds., Einstein on Peace (New York: Schoken Books, 1960).">planetization</a>."

The whole world, Mr. Trump should promptly acknowledge and without any fear of intelligent contradiction, is a <em><a style="cursor: help" title="'The existence of system in the world is at once obvious to every observer of nature,' says Jesuit philosopher Teilhard de Chardin, 'no matter whom....Each element of the cosmos is positively woven from all the others....'">system</a></em>. Among other things, he must finally understand that the true state of America's national union can never be any better than the state of the much wider world. In an added measure of reciprocity, he will also need to finally realize that the condition of this wider world must sometimes depend upon what happens inside the United States.

Ideally, in fully acknowledging this plainly misunderstood mutuality, indeed, such a vital human reciprocity, the overarching US presidential objective should seek to enhance the sacred dignity of each and every individual human being. It is precisely this high-minded and <a style="cursor: help" title="According to Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: '…a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.” See: Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Done at Vienna, May 23, 1969. Entered into force, Jan. 27, 1980. U.N. Doc. A/CONF">peremptory</a> goal that should now give specific policy direction to President Donald Trump.

It will be easy to dismiss any such seemingly lofty recommendation for human dignity as silly, ethereal or fanciful, especially in the bitterly demeaning ambit of Donald Trump. Still, in world politics and diplomacy, there could never be any more harmful American presidential naiveté than continuing to champion the darkly false extremity of "everyone for himself." Interestingly enough, Trump has already replicated this harmful dynamic in various critical matters of US domestic politics, cheerfully fostering the very same catastrophic war of "all against all" between American states and their increasingly desperate governors.

More than anything else, "America First" is a grievously misconceived presidential mantra, one that makes it exceedingly difficult to combat not only war, terrorism and genocide, but also terrifying disease epidemics. Devoid of empathy, intellect and human understanding, this Trump mantra can only lead the United States toward distressingly new depths of strife, disharmony and collective despair. Individually, Trump's <a style="cursor: help" title="Such belligerent nationalism would also have pertinent legal implication and consequences. In this connection, regarding US President Donald Trump, criminal responsibility of leaders under international law is not necessarily limited to direct personal action or limited by official position. On this peremptory principle of 'command responsibility,' or respondeat superior, see: In re Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1 (1945); The High Command Case (The Trial of Wilhelm von Leeb). The direct individual responsibility of leaders is also unambiguous in view of the London Agreement, which denies defendants the protection of the act of state defense. See AGREEMENT FOR THE PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE MAJOR WAR CRIMINALS OF THE EUROPEAN AXIS, Aug. 8, 1945.">belligerent nationalism</a>, left unrevised, would point everyone to an insufferable and potentially irreversible <em>vita minima</em>, that is, toward a corrupted personal and global life, one entirely emptied of itself.

By definition, such a shabby life would be meaningless, shattered, patently unfeeling and radically unstable.

There is more. The core inaccessibility of others' suffering, the relentless privacy of immobilizing human torment, has manifestly wide social and political consequences. For Americans, as for all others, the unique pain experienced by any one human body can never be shared with another. This is the true even if these bodies are closely related by blood, and even if they are tied together by other tangibly specific measures of racial, ethnic, or religious kinship.

Always, psychologically, the distance between one's own body and the body of another is indeterminably great. In consequence, this distance is impossible to traverse. Always. Whatever else we may have been taught about empathy and compassion, the vital "membranes" separating our individual bodies, one from the other, will always outweigh every conceivably detailed protocol of formal ethical instruction.

It's not complicated. Only by placing "Humanity First" can US President Donald Trump ever make "America First." The latter is simply not possible without the former. "The earth from which the first man was made," instructs the Talmud, "was gathered in all the four corners of the world." Whatever the difficulties involved, without expanding American empathy in this time of plague, there can be no meaningful long-term survival, for the United States or for the wider and interrelated world.

<em>As the current Covid-19 plague amply reveals, we are all fundamentally creatures of biology.</em>

		<title>Does the Bar Exam Measure Competence? The Answer: We Have No Idea.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last month, COVID-19 has forced more than 10 million Americans to file for unemployment. In the coming weeks, law students will join the surge, as employers begin to postpone employment start dates and rescind offers. Many employers, even Vault 100 firms, have cited bar exam postponement as a reason for hiring delays. Now, law students across the nation are mobilizing for progressive change to the attorney licensing process in response to COVID-19. Many of us—supported by attorneys and law professors—are <a href="https://www.dailyjournal.com/articles/357196-why-diploma-privilege-should-be-the-california-legal-profession-s-visionary-response-to-covid-19">advocating</a> for diploma privilege, a licensing scheme through which prospective attorneys are admitted to the State Bar upon graduation from law school.

As we ask our jurisdictions to change their licensing requirements to meet the needs of clients, employers, and students alike, we are met with some variation of the same question: if there is no bar exam, how can we truly assess attorney competency? We respond by attacking the faulty premise of the question. Why do we believe the bar exam actually tests attorney competence?

There is little to no credible evidence that the bar exam is an adequate measure of lawyer competency. Let’s take California, the jurisdiction to which we seek admission. The State Bar of California has not articulated what it even means to be minimally competent. Instead, the profession has accepted the bar exam as a measure of competency without stopping to think: what exactly are we measuring here, and what does it have to do with being a good lawyer? We understand that the State Bar is looking for some minimum threshold of competence to protect the public.

Interestingly, in a 2017 report to the California Supreme Court, the State Bar of California stated: “public protection has never been clearly defined.” At the same time, the <a href="https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/Conduct-Discipline/Rules/Selected-Legal-Authority/The-State-Bar-Act">State Bar Act</a> says the protection of the public includes “support for greater access to, and inclusion in, the legal system.” The State Bar seems to have omitted this understanding of public protection to avoid admitting responsibility for developing an exam that does precisely the opposite. Recognizing its own inconsistency would require the State Bar to focus less on attorney exclusion and, instead, dedicate some of its ample resources to preparing an examination that actually tests attorney competence in a manner where the link between exam and competence is apparent to the public. Despite its many years of ample resources and opportunities to do so, the State Bar has only made changes to the exam that increase the subject matter tested and reduce the expense of administering the exam.

Now, we recognize that a minimum threshold of competence is necessary for any licensing scheme. However, we need to figure out what competency means in the context of the legal profession. In the process, we should recognize that there exist numerous ways to <a href="https://www.dailyjournal.com/articles/357196-why-diploma-privilege-should-be-the-california-legal-profession-s-visionary-response-to-covid-19">prove</a> competencies, such as through staged licensing (as exists in the medical and dental fields), apprenticeships, yearly reviews by employers, and the continuation of legal education. Yet, the legal profession has stuck to a process that has been <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/building-a-better-bar-exam">described</a> as “an excellent barrier to entry, and [a] superb hazing ritual.” We then invariably begin discussing the history of the bar exam. Indeed, at its onset, the bar exam had one simple goal: to control the number of lawyers in the legal profession. This control was often the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/law-schools-failing-students-color/">result</a> of racism and sexism, as members of the Jewish community, people of color, and women sought entry into the profession. Even if we buy an argument for supply-side regulation of the legal profession, the State Bar of California purportedly does not. The State Bar supports “greater access to, and inclusion in, the legal system, [which] shall be the highest priority for the State Bar of California and the board of trustees in exercising their licensing [function].” Supply-side regulation of lawyers flies in the face of access to and inclusion in the legal system, as articulated by the State Bar itself.

We take as a solemn truth that clients come to us in times of crisis and share their most intimate details—even as students. Many legal claims do not have easy answers and navigating the legal process requires a baseline understanding of legal jargon and principles. But we must remember this: students attend law school, most full-time, for three years of their lives. In those three years, we spend the entirety of our days learning legal doctrine, participating in the law school Socratic method, and taking exams. Students then spend their second and third years in law school handling real-world cases, with real clients, through clinical opportunities and student practice organizations. We take experiential learning courses, where we participate in mock trials, negotiations, and mediations. We spend our summers helping attorneys write memorandums, motions, and briefs. Our law schools told us we would learn how to think like a lawyer in three years, and we amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to that end. After graduation, we are expected to take the bar exam, where we add upwards of $4,000 to our debt for an exam that generates millions in revenue. If we truly feel that completion of law school is insufficient to show competence, then we must seriously rethink our approach to legal education.

COVID-19 was an unforeseeable disruption in all of our lives. Its toll will be felt in the years to come. For these reasons, we advocate for one alternative in particular in the midst of a global pandemic: diploma privilege. Diploma privilege is a way to mitigate the adverse impact in the legal profession, with little real risk. And it is not impossible to implement. California enacted emergency licensing to law school graduates on two occasions in the 1900s. Wisconsin has had diploma privilege since the 1800s. West Virginia had it up until 1988. Given COVID-19, Pennsylvania and Utah are considering forms of emergency licensing, in lieu of a bar exam. Are these states interested in competency? Of course. Do they want to protect the public? Of course. But perhaps they, too, have come to recognize that the bar exam is not a reliable measure of competence, and it is certainly not our only option. It is time for our jurisdiction, California, and others to truly internalize the reality that the bar exam is not the arbiter of competence or ethics. Instead, it <a href="https://www.impactfund.org/california-cut-score">facilitates</a> the lack of people of color in the profession and is situated at the core of a large, profit-driven legal industrial complex.

As we navigate these unprecedented times, COVID-19 forces all of us to think critically about the value of the bar exam and to think creatively about other ways of licensing that may actually be rooted in empirical support. Why not take this opportunity to create visionary alternatives to the bar exam? As Brit Benjamin <a href="https://www.law.com/therecorder/2020/04/10/letter-to-the-editor-cancel-the-bar-exam/">suggested</a> in her letter to the editor, this period could launch the inaugural year of a pilot program that tests licensing alternatives. The program could gather data on whether attorney complaints and sanctions increase, whether malpractice claims skyrocket, and whether clients are more poorly represented in court. We have a unique opportunity to simultaneously license attorneys and gain data on whether other types of licensure may yield benefits.

Lastly, we are entering what will inevitably become a grave economic downturn in the aftermath of COVID-19. Individuals and families will need legal assistance with employment, housing, and medical claims. Diploma privilege would allow recent law school graduates to enter the profession and aid those in need.

We recognize that change is uncomfortable. It is also possible and necessary. We must think creatively about attorney licensing in our new world, and we underscore the reality that feasible alternatives exist. We simply cannot say that the bar exam is our only option. And we certainly cannot say that the bar exam ensures only those competent enter the legal profession. After all, where is the proof?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now, the effects of COVID-19 on American life and society are widespread and deeply felt, almost regardless of one’s socioeconomic status. However, for undocumented immigrants in the United States, the COVID-19 crisis compounds issues that have existed for years, exposing immigrants to a barrage of political, social, and economic storm fronts that have disastrously collided at once. News outlets have reported on the real consequences of the near-national shut down across the country. However, many recent news articles that cover the effects of COVID-19 on immigrants run the risk of understating the uniquely devastating sociolegal effects that the virus has on undocumented immigrants and their families.

<strong>The COVID-19 Crisis is Adding Pressures to an Otherwise Overburdened System</strong>

COVID-19 is creating additional chaos for immigrants in detention or who work <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/unexpected-heroes-on-the-frontlines-of-americas-coronavirus-lockdown-11585058205">frontline</a> jobs. Over the past three and a half years, the Trump administration has increased its efforts to detain as many undocumented immigrants as possible, eschewing the Obama-era approach to targeting violent undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants and low-income immigrants historically have worked in a variety of important jobs, ranging from field farmworker to retail clerk to registered nurse. These jobs, many of which now don the “essential” label that allows businesses to continue operating, disproportionately employ low-income and undocumented individuals, exposing them to COVID-19 on a daily basis.

<em>Immigrants in Detention</em>

Even before the COVID-19 crisis, advocates and lawmakers expressed grave concerns about the availability and adequacy of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/04/us/immigrant-medical-care-wellpath-invs/index.html">healthcare provided</a> in detention centers, which hold anywhere from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/detained-us-largest-immigrant-detention-trump">40-50,000</a> immigrants nationally. Though ICE and CBP generally delay or outright refuse to give responses to questions about healthcare and immigrant deaths in custody, in March, media sources were able to determine that ten immigrants have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexican-man-died-ice-custody-he-s-10th-person-october-n1167511">died</a> in ICE custody since October 2019, <em>before the COVID-19 crisis even arrived in the United States.</em>

Detention center conditions, including overcrowding and the lack of adequate healthcare, create a tinderbox scenario for detained immigrants, who often wait days or weeks, or even months, in small, packed cells. Detainees almost always <a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2020/04/14/coronavirus-new-lawsuit-says-conditions-in-immigrant-detention-center-ripe-for-virus/">share</a> toilets, sleeping mats, clothing, and food amongst themselves, and sleep in rooms on bunkbeds no larger than eight by ten feet. Current ICE detention guidelines allow COVID-19 to spread rapidly throughout its detainees, at times literally preventing any type of recommenced social distancing measures. Civil confinement should never result in the death of the individual, yet in ICE detention centers, death via COVID-19 will inevitably arrive.

Overcrowding is not the only problem immigrants face in ICE detention; access to adequate healthcare in ICE detention is spotty at best. Survivors of ICE detention have revealed ICE’s cruel and inhumane practices, like <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6827805-2020-04-07-OIG-Cmplt-Final-Redacted.html">ignoring</a> a pregnant woman’s pleas for help during birth and failing to transport immigrants to offsite hospitals in a timely manner, are routine in ICE detention centers. More recent experiences of detained immigrants, including an allegation that detention center guards used <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11812701/senators-want-to-know-if-ice-detainees-were-pepper-sprayed-after-requesting-masks">pepper spray</a> on detainees asking for masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Otay Mesa Detention Center in California, are evidence that ICE detention centers care little about the health of its occupants. There are already <a href="https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus">over 200</a> detainees who have contracted COVID-19 at ICE facilities nationwide. This number is sure to increase as the virus spreads rapidly through crowded cells and common eating areas.

In ICE detention centers, overcrowding and poor quality of healthcare are not the only problems detained immigrants face. ICE and CBP are blatantly opaque agencies that refuse to give an inch when protecting the secrecy of agency practices and rules from legal advocates. Battles for even the smallest amounts of information related to detention center conditions of treatment of detainees are frequently fought between government attorneys and immigrant advocates, resulting in surreal arguments that stretch the imagination (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/sarah-fabian-migrant-lawyer-doj.html">see</a> ICE trial attorney Sarah Fabian arguing that soap and blankets are not necessary for “safe and sanitary” detention conditions). Congressional oversight of these agencies is often shallow—not because Congressional members have no interest, but because ICE and CBP refuse to answer most questions posed to them. Senators, including recent presidential candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/KDH%20Enforcement%20at%20Sensitive%20Locations.pdf">sent</a> multiple letters to ICE, asking for more information about their efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/4.7.20%20FINAL%20Jud%20letter%20to%20DHS%20re%20Title%2042%20-%20SIGNED.pdf">pleading</a> for the release of many detained immigrants. None of these letters has been answered by DHS. Lawsuits inevitably illuminate some information regarding detention conditions, but this information is generally limited in scope, as judges hesitate to give outsiders access to documents that could undermine national security. The lack of transparency within ICE and CBP prevents advocates from ensuring that rights of undocumented immigrants are respected.

<em>Immigrants Working on the Frontline of the COVID-19 Crisis</em>

Detained immigrants are, in a way, obviously vulnerable to the transmission of COVID-19 due to inadequate healthcare and extreme overcrowding. However, undocumented, un-detained immigrants are also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. One estimate places about <a href="https://time.com/5823491/undocumented-immigrants-essential-coronavirus/">six million</a> undocumented workers at the frontlines of the crisis, acting as farm employees, grocery store clerks, and delivery truck drivers, and more. These workers, deemed “essential” in many cases, work long hours and are in contact with many other individuals often unable to implement the recommended social distancing practices. Undocumented frontline workers have so far received no financial support from the federal government. Some states, such as California, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/15/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-support-california-workers-impacted-by-covid-19/">created</a> special funds dedicated to supporting undocumented immigrants during the COVID-19 crisis, but most states have not. Undocumented workers, like other low-income workers across the United States, must weigh the possibility of COVID-19 transmission against empty refrigerators and mounting utility bills every single day.

Protections for low-income, frontline workers are minimal at best, and are often absent in places where personal protective equipment (PPE) is most needed. Undocumented immigrants are less likely to have access to healthcare benefits and social safety nets than other low-income Americans, and are more likely <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/05/undocumented-immigrants-coronavirus/">to work</a> in sectors where furloughs and layoffs have occurred at exponential rates. Whether Americans realize it or not, labor from undocumented immigrants supports nearly all sectors of modern life. Failing to protect these frontline workers from COVID-19 and its economic repercussions will have devastating effects across the nation.

<strong>The Consequences of COVID-19 Will Be Deadly for Many Immigrants</strong>

People across the United States are dying from COVID-19 at a rapid rate, despite steps taken to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, undocumented immigrants (<a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">approximately</a> 11 million strong) remain uniquely vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission. We continue to hold people, the majority of whom have never convicted of a crime, in overcrowded civil detention in a time where crowds almost certainly mean illness and death. Due process rights are seemingly falling by the wayside when detained immigrants need them most, another casualty of COVID-19. Immigrants who have the ability to pay bond, and leave overcrowded detention cells behind, are unable to have hearings when judges close courtrooms. Bond hearings are abruptly canceled or indefinitely postponed, because immigration judges refuse to endanger themselves and court staff by holding immigration proceedings in<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2020-03-19/despite-pandemic-san-diegos-immigration-courts-remain-open"> confined</a> courtrooms. Detainees are so desperate for any semblance of protection from COVID-19 that some have begun hunger strikes to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-19/advocates-say-hundreds-of-immigrants-detained-in-california-are-on-hunger-strike-ice-says-just-two-are">protest</a> the inhumane, dangerous conditions inside detention centers.

Social safety nets, ranging from existing Medicare programs to newer, COVID-19 specific relief, is often unavailable to undocumented immigrants, leaving this vulnerable population even more at risk of economic disaster than other low-income groups. Despite widespread government and community criticism, many employers of frontline laborers continue to fail to provide PPE, or even hand soap on site. Undocumented immigrants fear COVID-19, but also ICE and CBP, who are certainly not slowing their operations to track and apprehend undocumented immigrants during this crisis. Some undocumented immigrants described an intense fear of seeking healthcare for COVID-19, noting that ICE has detained immigrants at doctors’ offices and emergency rooms around the country. Congressional calls for the rapid, widescale release of immigrants from detention centers have been largely ignored, although in recent days, reports of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/16/835886346/ice-releases-hundreds-as-coronavirus-spreads-in-detention-centers">limited releases</a> from detention centers have begun to surface. It is certainly, then, possible to release immigrants from detention. It is also morally and ethically imperative to release individuals accused of civil violations from the overcrowded detention centers where COVID-19 outbreaks will certainly erupt. It is only a matter of time, and a short one at that, until ICE reluctantly admits that detained immigrants have died from COVID-19. Individual lawsuits that result in the release of handfuls of immigrants at a time are a piecemeal solution that will save few lives. The exact number of immigrants who died preventable deaths from COVID-19 in ICE custody will likely be exponential unless immediate action is taken to release detainees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While India is battling with a pandemic, financial and economical threats are looming all around. Various schemes have come to the rescue such as a relief package worth INR 1.70 lakh crore, extending the dates for filing taxes, providing 15,000 crores for health infrastructure, waiving the requirement of maintaining certain minimum balance in bank accounts, and extending the date for filing tax returns. State governments have also introduced financial packages. Along with this, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/economy-business/tracking-india-s-steps-to-contain-economic-fallout-here-is-a-guide-to-coronavirus-measures-announced-by-centre-rbi-826051.html">eased</a> norms for insolvency and bankruptcy, MSME’s, etc.

Against this backdrop, there is a blooming of diverse and contrarian ideas by some sections of society. Recently, Public Interest Litigation was filed by Centre for Accountability and Systematic Change(CASC) in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration of emergency which was later on deferred citing it as not conducive to the situation. Fake news was also reported regarding probable declaration of financial emergency by PM Narendra Modi. Political leaders like Mr. Subramanian Swamy proposed the same idea. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/there-is-no-financial-emergency-economy-fears-unfounded-says-fm-sitharaman/articleshow/74791562.cms">said</a>, "No move to impose financial emergency has been contemplated as was claimed by some reports" while addressing the media.

To ward off financial threats, an alternative paradigm is being proposed for financial emergencies. But does the current situation demand it? Let us analyse it.

<em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Phase of worst financial crises</strong></span></em>

Turning the pages of history, Financial Emergency (FM) has never been imposed in our country even when the worst <em><strong>financial crises</strong></em> hit our country in 1991. The economy was in turmoil. Back then India was not on good terms with the western world and depended on the Soviet Union for its exports. But when the Soviet Union fragmented into 15 nations, those exports went significantly down. The US-Iraq war let to an exponential increase in oil prices. Unstable government was present. By June 1991, India had less than $1 billion foreign reserves, just about enough dollars to meet about three weeks of imports. The scenario was worse than today, where the nation had no international support, an ineffective government structure, and poor economic infrastructure all present at the same time.

In the current status quo, the financial economy is still secured and the legislative schemes, as well as international support, will sustain the nation’s financial status. The International Monetary Fund has <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/COVID-Lending-Tracker">set up</a> emergency finance and has facilitated multilateral surveillance on crises and policy actions. The US has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-foreign-aid-protective-equipment.html">announced</a> financial assistance to 64 countries including USD 2.9 million to India and China has provided medical assistance.

<em><strong>Consequences of FM</strong></em>

The provision of financial emergency (FM) has been enshrined in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1850059/">Article 360</a> of the Indian Constitution. The criteria for its proclamation is, <em>if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or credit of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened</em>, then financial emergency may be proclaimed.

To discern the status quo, it is essential to delve deep into the overriding challenges which India will confront if FM is imposed before reaching the conclusion that FM is the best possible solution for handling the situation. To shed light on it, let’s have a glimpse of the Constituent Assembly Debates in order to know the horizon and powers which the central government and President will yield and the potential lacunas which will result therein, if the provision is invoked.

Dr. Ambedkar introduced <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/559924/">Article 280A</a> drawing inspiration from <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&amp;doc=66">National Recovery Act</a> of the United States. He put it forth on table for further suggestions and amendments for the provisions of financial emergency. Primarily, Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru put forward his apprehensions:
<blockquote>“The Centre will acquire complete control over the budget of the province and will be able to dictate both to the provincial government and the provincial legislature what financial policies they should adopt. This is not meant to enable the Central Government to deal with unemployment relief, or public works, or any of those problems whose solution would lead to economic contentment and add to the wealth of India..”</blockquote>
As said by Kazi Karimuddin, “<em>emergency will lead to a conflict oftentimes between the Centre and the Provinces, and instead of breathing an atmosphere of independence, freedom and liberty, we will be subject to the utmost interference from the Centre and the president.</em>” On the contrary, Prof. Shiban Lal Saexna proposed to enhance the powers of central government by allowing Parliament to make laws in State List as if they were in concurrent list during emergency to avoid centre-state conflict and Sh. Brajeshwar Prasad added that the emergency should last till the President deems fit. Finally, Mr. Sidhva concluded by these wording, “I am confident that the President whosoever he may be, he will exercise his power rightly, and interpret this article in the right sense and in the right manner and for the benefit of the country.” Thus, the apprehensions around potential misuse of powers were rejected.

The government was not vested with a wanton amount of powers and the above suggestions were rejected on the ground that then the executive will alone play a dominant part in the national life. But Mr. Saxena’s apprehensions are somewhat relevant in the present situation where matters like public order, health, sanitation, hospitals, etc. fall under State List and are at centre stage during the pandemic. Gulfs will arise between the centre and state government when the executive will have the authority to give directions to observe canons of financial propriety and state will at certain instances lack the authority to enforce legislation of their own which falls under state list because of the centre’s dissent for the financial allocations demanded.

Individuals and even the think tank CASC (as highlighted in the petition) demanded FM under the impression that the emergency will address the situation through constitutional provisions and not open the door for police actions. Statutes like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/section-144">Section 144</a> prohibit gatherings of more than four, and empower police to arrest anyone who violates the orders promulgated by the government under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1432790/">Section 188</a> of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Police are additionally empowered to arrest individuals for violation of quarantine restrictions once <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1726256/">Section 271</a> of IPC is applied. But financial emergency empowers the central government to give directions limited to financial matters which was also highlighted by Dr. Munshi, “<em>In a financial emergency there cannot be greater privilege than all financial affairs which shall be controlled and directed from the centre.</em>”

A measure like emergency under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1594774/">article 359</a> which confers powers to the president to suspend fundamental rights (except article 20 &amp; 21) might lead to public dissent and thus aggravate the situation. At the core of emergency-related legal issues is the need to balance individual and state interests to protect the public’s health. Balancing respective legal interests in emergencies is complex. The interests of individuals and the state may conflict, leading to difficult issues in the establishment and implementation of community objectives.

It is claimed that through the declaration of emergency Central and State government will work in a unified manner but during FM, the President can reduce the salaries of all government officials, including judges of the Supreme Court and High Court. The fundamental support is being provided by the administration staff and bureaucrats of government and the fear of reduction in salaries or other similar measures can divert their attention from their main focus to control the widespread effect of the disease.

<em><strong>Effective Legal Statute</strong></em>

Although financial adversities are stumbling blocks emergency is declared under grave circumstances where the legal methods have exhausted and it is the last recourse available. COVID-19 can be encompassed under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/398597/">Section2(d)</a> of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which deals with the definition of disaster as COVID-19 is a grave occurrence arising from natural causes. To shed light on the financial perspective, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/294446/">Section 12</a> deals with the requirements to be provided with things like cereals, shelter, and provisions for senior citizens, ex gratia assistance for restoring livelihood and such other reliefs which are deemed to be necessary. Moreover, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/727745/">Section 13</a> provides for recommending relief in repayment of loans or for grant of fresh loans to the persons affected by disaster on such concessional terms as may be appropriate. These sections address the rising trade of concerns for facilitating relief to the unorganised sector, small-scale industries, micro enterprises, etc where short-term loans, food essentials will be provided. Let us also highlight the phrase ‘other phase’ where government can lay down any number of relief measures for restoring standard livelihood.

<em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em>

The above article aimed at describing how financial emergency is not conducive to the situation through legal various prospectives. It is essential to understand that under current paramaters where effective legal statues for tackling the financial crises are present, inevitable consequences will follow if financial emergency is invoked.

		<title>UCLA Law, Stop Excusing White Supremacy and Start Supporting Black Students</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We don't apologize either.

In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting Black students, and making it harder for them to learn in an already hostile environment, last week’s events at UCLA School of Law have been a drain. The Black students of UCLA are exhausted and frustrated by the law school’s lackluster responses to repeated instances of anti-Blackness on campus. Such responses have only served to exacerbate the hostile learning environment Black students experience. Ultimately communicating: the school lacks the tools to remedy the concerns of its Black students.

With each instance of anti-Blackness, Black students must exert additional time, energy, and labor to not only defend ourselves, but also support each other. The most recent instance of anti-Blackness involved a tenured, high profile UCLA law professor using the n-word twice on the law school campus. Despite Black students mobilizing to create flyers, meeting with administration, and the Dean issuing a modest apology, this professor doubled down on his racist rhetoric. In doubling down, it was made clear to Black students that the pedagogical and Constitutional arguments made to defend his behavior were pretext for blatant and consistent racism.

The administrative response to this instance, and others like it, is simply not enough. The law school repeatedly relies on the labor of its Black students to make the law school space more inviting for potential Black students. Yet, it does very little to support us in return. Black students are already expected to juggle the regular demands of legal academia, while enduring an approach to the law that minimizes the racist nature of American jurisprudence. The additional responsibility of supporting one another, and attempting to make the law school space more tolerable, only adds to that load - a load our peers do not carry.

It is time that UCLA School of Law started to share in the work that Black students have been doing to ameliorate the harms of the law school and create a more inclusive community. Black students should not be forced to take classes with professors who consistently devalue our humanity and tokenize other members of our community in an effort to silence and undermine our concerns. In an institution where there are so few professors that teach critical courses in an anti-racist way, Black students are forced to choose between either sitting through dehumanizing class after class or opting out of core courses and clinical opportunities, which might have been instrumental in their decision to choose UCLA School of Law. This is unacceptable.

Further, the law school’s lack of infrastructure to respond to Black students’ concerns is worrying. Given that anti-Blackness on campus lacks novelty, the fact that there is not a clear procedure for responding to and rectifying these harms adds to the burden Black students endure. The law school desperately needs to implement a clear and efficient mechanism for recieving, addressing, and rectifying these issues if they hope to make the law school more inclusive.

Until the concerns of Black students are actively addressed and remedied, UCLA School of Law will remain an intolerant and hostile space for Black students. The UCLA chapter of the Black Law Student Association (BLSA) <a href="http://uclalawprotectblackstudents.com/background">proposed</a> a list of changes they would like to see UCLA School of Law implement as early as this Fall. These changes include creating a Student Bill of Rights, a law school specific protocol for dealing with grievances, and handouts on Diversity Best Practices that would be distributed to all faculty. In the long run, BLSA is requesting additional funding and material support for Black students as a way for the school to demonstrate a commitment to their recruitment, retention, and prosperity during their academic tenure. This initiative involves the creation of a Director of Diversity Admissions and hiring two additional critical race faculty members, including at least one First Amendment scholar. Most importantly, we are demanding that students should not be forced to take a class with any professor who has a history of using pedagogical methods that are gratuitous in nature.

The law school’s response to these changes will be a testament to their commitment to the recruitment, retention, and support of Black law students.

<em>UCLA Law Black Law Students Association (UCLA BLSA) is a student organization at the UCLA School of Law dedicated to supporting and advocating for Black law students.</em>

		<title>Child Custody During COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amid the stay-at-home orders, the issue of child custody exchanges has emerged as a concern among separated families. Some parents have found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/coronavirus-divorce-coparenting.html">co-parenting</a> to be easier during the pandemic. Many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-child-custody.html">other</a> co-parents have not been so lucky. Families are looking for guidance on whether to follow custody orders during the pandemic. Co-parenting continues to be complicated by social distancing and stay-at-home orders. As courts across the country shut down, the concerns began to include how to handle emerging and unsettled custody matters. Things can become a bit chaotic when parents are fearful about the health and safety of their children. It can become even more so when the parents are engaged in a custody battle.

The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers released <a href="https://aaml.org/page/AAMLPressRelease19TipsforParentingDuringCOVID-19L?&amp;amp;hhsearchterms=%22covid%22.">pointers</a> at the start of the social distancing. The pointers encourage co-parents to (1) follow court orders; (2) follow state and local orders; (3) base parenting decisions and choices on reliable news sources; (4) use highest level communication skills with a co-parent; (5) be honest; (6) arrange to make up for lost time; and (7) learn how to be virtual. These pointers are a good starting place for a discussion, but they do not solve a custody crisis.

The first issue arises as parents and lawyers try to decipher whether custody orders and stay-at-home orders are in conflict. The general rule of thumb seems to be that parents should continue to exchange custody pursuant to a court order during a stay-at-home order. Parents are asked to treat custody exchanges as essential. Some states have specifically stated that custody exchanges pursuant to an order are permitted. The Ohio stay-at-home <a href="https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/static/DirectorsOrderStayAtHome.pdf">order</a>, dated March 19, specifically includes “Travel required by law enforcement or court order, including to transport children pursuant to a custody agreement.” Some states have said transportation for care of child is essential, leaving interpretation to allow for custody exchanges. Parents should treat private custody agreements like custody orders, even though courts are providing guidance about private orders.

There is no precedent for how to handle this situation in a custody matter. Lawyers honestly tell clients they are not sure what will happen during the court closure. In the same breath, lawyers are telling clients to remain calm and act in a way you can later justify to a judge. Courts are issuing directives that custody orders should be followed. In Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/Administration/CustodyOrdersDuringJudicialEmergency.pdf?V=1">issued</a> an administrative order saying that custody exchanges, pursuant to orders from the Court, should continue with “consideration for the safety of the child.” Delaware Courts have issued a <a href="https://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=120718">statement</a> that encourages people to keep following custody orders. Some courts have issued guidance on what to do in the event of potential exposure to COVID-19, like <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/page-1305/file-8966.pdf?cb=1587070324015">Bucks County</a>, Pennsylvania.

Courts are asking parents to be reasonable and stay calm. They are looking for realistic solutions. No one has a pandemic clause in their custody agreement. There is no correct way to co-parent during this time. Parents need to communicate with each other. If changes need to occur, make the request and explain why. Do you want to change the schedule to reduce travel or potential exposure? Are you concerned about travel between houses because rest stops are closed? Is the third party supervisor no longer available because of social distancing?

As parents talk about the physical custody schedule, they need to consider other aspects of the parenting relationship. The parents might need to be on the same schedule about remote schooling. They may need to incorporate Skype, FaceTime, or Zoom to have contact with children if they go longer between exchanges.

Front-line workers are facing this custody crisis even more. Disputes are arising about whether front-line workers should retain custody of their minor children. Courts across the country are dealing with this issue. The court response are varied. Many are saying the increased risk of exposure to coronavirus is not enough to suspend custody rights. Some courts are modifying or suspending custody because of increased risk. Where courts are not open, parents are exercising self-help. A parent exercising self-help must be able to justify their reasoning to a court when it reopens; the parent should keep in mind a judge will likely hear numerous similar cases. It is unclear how the judges will react when courts reopen. Some frontline workers are voluntarily relinquishing custody. It is unclear if these parents will be eligible for make-up time.

When it comes to addressing the pandemic directly, the topics become more complicated. Parents need to openly discuss their social distancing habits. The parents should be on the same page about how they explain the stay-at-home policies to the children. There needs to be a sharing of information if the child is exhibiting signs of anxious behavior and what those behaviors are. Is the child cranky, lashing out, sad, or tired? These behaviors might be different in each household.

Some courts have limited access to emergency matters only. The determination of what is an emergency can be subjective. In Florida, an Emergency Room doctor <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/us/custody-coronavirus-er-doctor-trnd/index.html">lost custody</a> of her child because of her increased risk of contracting the coronavirus at the trial court level. The appellate court <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/15/florida-emergency-doctor-regains- custody-daughter-amid-coronavirus/5139145002/">overturned</a> the decision days later, and the parties returned to split custody. There is no set standard for what happens when a parent or a child is exposed, or potentially exposed to coronavirus. This may be complicated if the child, a parent, or a household member have a condition that may make them more susceptible to coronavirus or more susceptible to complications from coronavirus.

In each jurisdiction, a parent has to determine if there court is open or closed. If the court is closed, is it closed to all matters or just non-essential matters? What is an essential court matter? If there is an emergency custody matter, how do you get it to a court?

Courts that have an electronic filing system for custody matters might be easier to navigate, especially if the filing system forwards the documents to the judge. In these instances, court requests about custody can get to a judge in a socially distant society. Courts where requests were hand delivered or mailed to the judges were likely harder to navigate as the courts shutdown. All of a sudden, there was no way to contact judges.

Some courts have adjusted. The adjustment has occurred with various degrees of ease. Virtual or real drop-off boxes have been created. Settlement and status conferences are occurring via conference or video call. Cases are beginning to move forward again. Courts are exploring virtual hearings. Each jurisdiction is providing a different level of access to the family court.

Some courts have not adjusted. Some courts remain closed with no ability to request relief, which could create a backlog of cases that seems insurmountable. On the other hand, it could force parents to find a solution because there is not intervention available.

As society remains shut down or begins to reopen, the issues surrounding custody cases will continue to change. Co-parents will have to navigate these issues thoughtfully. Hopefully, as governments issue stay-at-home orders and modifications, they will specifically address custody orders. Hopefully, courts will continue to issue guidance about custody during pandemics. As this moves forward, parents need to stay calm and be thoughtful.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em><strong>Please note that "slum-dweller" as used in this piece is not intended to be offensive and is intended only to refer to individuals living in housing lacking proper sanitation, drinking water, and transportation facilities.</strong></em></blockquote>
<strong>Introduction:</strong>

Due to rapid urbanization and lack of a proper housing scheme in India, slums have become a dumping ground for the surplus urban population. These slums are regarded as illegal from the point of view of city planners. The total number of slums in India amount to more than <a href="https://www.census2011.co.in/slums.php">65 million</a>, of which around 11 million are in Maharashtra, followed by Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. These slums lack basic amenities, such as safe drinking water and sanitation.

In order to remove these slum dwellers, the government authorities resort to “forced evictions”, which results in serious violation of their human rights. This article is an attempt to analyze the rights of these slum dwellers.

<strong>Previous approach regarding the Human Rights of Slum Dwellers:</strong>

The accumulation of a large population in a small area (slums) with an inhabitable infrastructure <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Housing/InformalSettlements/UNHABITAT_HumanRights-BasedApproch.pdf">leads</a> to the inadequate distribution of resources among the people making them more vulnerable and ultimately leading to the infringement of human rights. Living in slums leads to a lack of proper sanitation, clean drinking water, and transportion facilities. Slum-dwellers often face poor economic conditions and thus have little power to oppose big companies who often encroach on their rights.

Most slums are located on the government’s land. Evictions from this land used to take place without even providing alternate housing to the slum dwellers leaving them to live at road paths with no other option. The court’s decisions would often favor the government and disregard the serious human rights violations the slum dwellers would face. But more recently, as more non-profit organizations have begun spreading awareness of human rights violations, the trend has started to change.

<strong>International Stance</strong>

Human Rights are <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Housing/InformalSettlements/UNHABITAT_HumanRights-BasedApproch.pdf">termed</a> as the “basic parameters” which assure the integrity of individuals are met for their overall development and that their rights will be protected against the more powerful entities. The section of society that is most vulnerable to having their rights infringed upon is the poorer section, which works in an unorganized sector and lives in a self-made informal structure, also known as slums. To provide more adequate housing, several treaties, laws, and legislations have been laid by several different nations.

The major laws that deal with the protection of slum dweller’s human rights are:
<blockquote>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf">UDHR</a>)<span>: </span><span>Article 25 of UDHR states that every individual has a right to a satisfactory standard of living, along with the enjoyment of clothing, food, and medical care. Special care is to be taken of women and children. It also covers the right to security in the event of unemployment.</span>

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/cescr.aspx">CESCR</a>): <span>Article 11 of the CESCR recognizes the right of adequate housing to everyone with a focus on continuous improvement in living conditions. It also ensures the right to remain free from hunger (identified as a fundamental right) for every individual and commands the state to take adequate measures to ensure that these rights are not infringed.</span>

The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families<span> – <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cmw.pdf">Article 43</a> in the convention discusses the right to access housing of migrant workers and their families. It also provides them protection against rent exploitation.</span>

<span>The Convention Relating to the Status of </span><span>Refugees – <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.23_convention%20refugees.pdf">Article 21</a> states that the most possible and favorable atmosphere is to be provided to refugees along with other adequate and basic requirements.</span></blockquote>
&nbsp;

The Convention on the Rights of the Child<span> - </span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx">Article 27</a> states<span> that appropriate measures should be taken to provide adequate housing, clothing and nutrition along with material assistances and support programs. </span>

<span>The</span> primary goal each of these regulations is to provide shelter and immunity against encroachment on basic human rights of the aggrieved population.

The largest problem of slums arises in the densely populated states or the under-developed states lacking the resources to provide accommodations in habitable atmospheres to their economically deprived community. Some of the largest slums in the world are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/these-are-the-worlds-five-biggest-slums/">located</a> at Khayelitsha in Cape Town, South Africa with 400,000 inhabitants, Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya with 700,000 inhabitants and Dharavi in Mumbai, India: 1,000,000 – all of which fall under the above-mentioned criteria.

Apart from the legislation, there are several governmental and non-governmental organizations, such as <a href="https://unhabitat.org/">UN-Habitat</a> and <a href="http://gpoba.org/">GPRBA</a>, which deal with the issues in slums and provide alternate shelter to dwellers.

<strong>Indian approach towards securing the rights of Slum Dwellers:</strong>

The Supreme Court of India has <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">held</a> that the right to life of human beings is not limited to mere animal existence and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/78536/">extends</a> to the right to live with human dignity, including shelter, clothing, nutrition. The Court has also <a href="https://www.lawyerservices.in/UPAvas-Evam-Vikas-Parishad-and-Another-Versus-Ravi-Kumar-Anand-and-Ors-1995-05-02">interpreted</a> the right to be a fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(e) and 21 of the Indian <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/constitution-india/constitution-india-full-text">Constitution</a>.

There is no specific law in India that deals with the removal of slums. For the purpose of eviction, the government resorts to laws dealing with property and cleanliness, which are distinct from forced eviction laws. Also, none of the provisions from the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI6byKyrzoAhV4yTgGHeisB4EQFjACegQIBBAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegislative.gov.in%2Factsofparliamentfromtheyear%2Fpublic-premises-eviction-unauthorised-occupants-act-1971&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jLEtH2-kH3NvgRhuxUqVu">Public Premises Act</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=18&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiw3b-eyrzoAhVMyjgGHTIXAp8QFjARegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Findiankanoon.org%2Fdoc%2F7832%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Hmg3JyrbcomoCDXmyaBWs">Land Acquisition Act</a> discuss the forced eviction of slum dwellers.

The  Supreme Court of India <a href="https://www.escr-net.org/caselaw/2019/municipal-council-ratlam-v-shri-vardhichand-others-1980-air-1622-1981-scr-1-97">declared</a> in <u>Ratlam Municipal Council vs. Vardichand</u> that ensuring the public health of slum dwellers is the statutory duty of municipal corporations. The Court has also recognized the slum dweller’s right to life is not <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1352960/">limited</a> to a mere roof over their heads, but <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1646284/">extends</a> to the right to water, food, education, medical care, and sanitation. The question of whether the forced eviction of slum dwellers is a human rights violation came before the Supreme Court in <u>Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corpn</u>, where the Court <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/">held</a> that eviction would amount to the violation of the right to life, and although <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution does not give slum dwellers the absolute right to reside anywhere, the eviction process should be just, fair and reasonable and the dwellers must be relocated to other suitable places.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>

There is a need for a shift in perception regarding slum dwellers when it comes to town-planning. The international <a href="https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/10188.pdf">obligations</a> regarding the rights of slum dwellers must be followed in order to prevent human rights violations. It must not be forgotten that the slum dwellers, who constitute major part of the population, are human beings and should be provided the basic amenities of life, as well as resources to be able to contribute towards the economy. The problems faced by slum dwellers must be solved by the government with the help of long-term solutions. More non-governmental and governmental organizations must come forward to eradicate this issue and protect the human rights of slum dwellers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

A legal personality or a juristic personality is an entity other than a natural being which the law deems capable of holding such rights and duties which are normally accorded to human beings exclusively. The rights accorded can range from a few legal rights which the according authority conceives to be cardinal to the functioning of the entity to an array of fundamental rights that protect the entity in every domain.

Salmond defines a legal person as:
<blockquote>“<em>any subject matter other than a human being to which the law attributes personality. This extension for good and sufficient reasons of the concept of personality beyond the class of human beings is one of the most noteworthy feats of the legal imagination.</em>”</blockquote>
The idea of an environmental entity existing as a legal person owes its genesis to the scholarly work of Christopher D. Stone “Should Trees Have Standing? Towards Legal Rights for Natural Objects” and the work’s subsequent referral by Justice William Douglas in the 1972 US Supreme Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/727/">case</a> of Sierra Club v. Morton. The case is, primarily, remembered for the dissenting opinion of Justice William Douglas who contended for different environmental elements to have a <em>locus standi</em> before the court of law for their own protection and preservation. According to him, by having the regulatory agencies speak for distinct environmental elements, we were holding back the interests of these inanimate objects as the regulatory agencies had started to be more and more “industry-minded” and consequently were giving in to the idea of development at the cost of the natural aesthetic wonders. He believed all those people who share a purposeful relationship with any given environmental body should have a <em>locus standi</em> to defend the environmental body and its values. He asserted that the idea of an environmental entity having a <em>locus standi</em> wasn’t all that outlandish since inanimate objects like ships and corporate entities were already recognized as an acceptable adversary for an array of adjudicatory processes. By granting environment a standing to be heard, he contended, there will be better sustenance of the ecological equilibrium and preservation.

Even today the essence of the principle propounded by Justice William Douglas back in 1972 can be discerned in a number of judicial pronouncements and legislation across the world that advocate for according of certain rights to nature and some even going out of their way in according legal personality to an array of flora and fauna and other environmental elements. These developments come in as a welcome change to the usual legal narrative which maintains an anthropocentric view and perspective to cases and disputes involving nature. Jurisdictions like New Zealand, India, Bolivia, Ecuador, etc. have come up with diverse conceptions of environment as a judicial personality and thus it is rendered necessary to understand the rationale involved in each of these scenarios.

<strong>1) Ecuador</strong>

In the year 2007, Ecuador went through the Citizens’ Revolution (“La Revolucion Ciudadana”) which saw Rafael Correa rising up the ranks to become the country’s president. In persuasion of his promise of an anti-neoliberalist Ecuador, President Rafael Correa called for creation of a new Constitution for the country. The indigenous groups of the country, with the help of National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), proposed for the incorporation of their concepts of <em>sumac kawsay</em> (Good Living) and <em>Pachamama</em> (Mother Earth) in the new constitution.

Thus, consequently, the 7th chapter of the country’s <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/es/ec/ec030es.pdf">new Constitution</a> titled “Rights of Nature” recognizes <em>Pachamama</em> as a legal entity engendering nature to have rights “<em>to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution</em>." In order to enforce the rights of nature, any individual or group of individuals can petition on behalf of nature. Thus, Ecuador became the first country ever to recognize and enshrine rights of nature within its Constitution.

<strong>2) Bolivia</strong>

The chain of events in Ecuador were soon followed by similar developments in Bolivia. Much like Ecuador, the demand for rights of nature was made by the indigenous groups of the country. In 2010, the Bolivian government came out with the “Law of the Rights of Mother Earth." The law incorporated 10 articles, which enumerated 7 specific rights to Mother Earth and her constituting life systems (i.e. all other biological creatures). It gave nature rights relating to life, regeneration, biodiversity, water, clean air, balance, and restoration. The law also goes on to recognize Mother Earth as “collective subject of public interest." This was done so as to ensure the exercise and protection of nature’s rights. Thus, this was a marked departure from the anthropocentric perspective to an Earth community-based perspective. Subsequently, in 2012, a full version of the same law came into being called “The Framework Law of Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well”.

<strong>3) New Zealand</strong>

In New Zealand, much in resemblance to the above two countries, the march towards granting personhood to environmental elements was started due to efforts of a tribal community. The Maori tribe and a few of its sub-tribes considered the Whanganui river as their ancestor. This particular idea was crucial to the Maori worldview and thus they fought for the recognition of the same for more than 140 years. Their efforts finally bore fruit in 2014, when the government personified <em>Te Urewera</em> (formerly a National Park) and brought into being the country’s first environmental legal person.

Soon after, the status of Whanganui river followed signaling the end of New Zealand’s longest running litigation. The river was awarded legal status as a living entity. The status accorded meant that the law would now treat the harming of the river the same way as harming the Maori tribe. Consequently, to help enforce the river’s rights, two guardians were appointed.

<strong>4) India</strong>

In India, much like in other countries, discrete environmental elements have been accorded with rights in the recent past, but with no major leaps in the domain. With no major legislation relating to nature’s rights, the progress has mostly been brought about by judicial pronouncements. In the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/298957/">T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India</a>, the apex court of the country stated that for proper justice to the environment it was necessary to drift away from the then prevalent anthropocentric perspective to a rather eco-centric one. Anthropocentrism involves appraising nature’s value for the benefits and advantages it can provide to humans. Contrary to this, Ecocentrism advocates for valuing nature for its own intrinsic value (nature-centered). On similar lines, there have been pronouncements relating to other living forms. In the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/39696860/">Animal Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja</a>, the Supreme Court allowed that the Indian Constitution’s Article 21 right to life could be extended to non-human animals. Similarly, in 2013, India’s Ministry of Environment and Forests <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/dolphins-gain-unprecedented-protection-in-india/a-16834519">declared</a> cetaceans as “non-human persons” in a bid to protect them from harm. The government stated that a research had concluded cetaceans to be highly intelligent and sensitive, and that dolphins "should be seen as 'non-human persons' and as such should have their own specific rights."

The most important judicial pronouncement relating to Environmental personhood, though, came in 2017. The Uttarakhand High Court, in <em>Mohd. Salim v. State of Uttarakhand</em>, ruled that the two rivers, Gangotri and Yamunotri, are ‘living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person’. Soon after in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/92201770/">Lalit Miglani v. State of Uttarakhand</a>, the Uttarakhand HC declared that:
<blockquote>“<em>the Glaciers, including Gangotri &amp; Yamunotri, rivers, streams, rivulets, lakes, air, meadows, dales, jungles, forests wetlands, grasslands, springs and waterfalls, are legal entity/legal person/juristic person/juridical person/moral person/artificial person having the status of a legal person, with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person, in order to protect and conserve them.</em>”</blockquote>
The ecosystem, surrounding Gangotri and Yamunotri, was also accorded rights akin to fundamental rights/legal rights. These two verdicts were challenged in the apex court of the country which ordered a stay provisionally.

Nearly a year after Uttarakhand High Court passed the above two orders, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/68914216/">Karnail Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, came up with a similar ruling according the status of “legal person or entity” to animals in Haryana in pursuance of promotion of their welfare. The Court also declared every citizen ‘persons in loco parentis’ (in place of a parent) authorizing the state’s citizens to file petition on behalf of the animals harmed.

Last month too, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, while responding to a 2009 petition, declared Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake to be a legal entity with rights, duties and liabilities of a living person. The court believed the decision to be imperative for the lake’s survival, preservation and conservation since the large-scale illegal construction in the catchment area, prevailing until then, had took an extensive toll on the ecosystem in and around.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

What these developments bring forth is that, with the issue of climate change and rights of nature taking center stage in countries all across the world, legal personhood seems to have struck as a promising tool for observers because of the sheer unexclusive nature of corporate personhood that Justice William Douglas once contended. Just like Environmental personhood, the concept of corporate personhood had also met with a fair share of opposition. The idea of a corporate entity exercising its own rights and possessing duties, severally from the employees that actually run it, somewhat on par with the citizens of a country, did perplex the eminent jurists of the contemporary times just as the concept of environmental personhood does today. In its preliminary form, a primary upside to corporate personhood was that it provided a method to have a property in collective ownership and consequently the property could exist independently of any single person’s life span. With time it was seen that for better economic development, incorporation would be advantageous as contrary to the concept of partnership, a corporation continued to exist even after death of a partner. So, it’s evident that throughout history whenever the ambit of application of rights and duties is expanded it happens to seem unimaginable and unpractical. But once the abstraction is internalized and put into operation, it seems highly unremarkable and mainstream. Environmental personhood, as a concept, is traversing the same path in the legal sphere.

It’s apparent that the granting of legal personhood to environmental elements has always been undertaken with the intent of protecting nature and its elements. The progress, though, has been slow and largely in the form of judicial pronouncements. Apart from a few, none of the countries have endorsed any overt legislation to provide nature with rights or personhood. In view of the course that corporate personhood traversed on its way to the, supposedly, unremarkable present self, it becomes necessary for a precursory legislation to come into operation. Such exclusive legislation would act as an effective way to familiarize the society and nature observers with the edge that the concept of legal personhood provides over existing environment protection legal instruments in protection and conservation of distinct environmental elements. With environment protection laws throughout the world displaying their own set of limitations, in the light of climate change, the concept of Environmental Personhood becomes all the more crucial and enterprising.

But, conceptualizing a rights-based framework for protecting nature confronts us with a plethora of impediments. An entity bestowed with legal rights, within the Hohfeldian analysis of jural relations, is supposed to undertake certain corresponding duties as well, thus a person exercising a right to life has a duty to not endanger others’ lives as well, an idea which doesn’t seem all that practical from the outset. Even the transition from the present-day anthropocentric approach to the prospective eco-centric approach would mean that modern day states will have to change their perspective towards the concept of development since the latter puts highest stake on environmental protection and conservation. Also, according personhood to environmental elements would result in an overhaul in the relationship that man and nature have grown to share since the genesis of human civilization. But, nevertheless it is the change in the idea of relationship that man and nature share which has opened a whole new set of legal horizons for the rights of nature. The development of legal arguments in these horizons can possibly change the mindset of today’s society and normalize social imaginings of rights of nature and Environmental Personhood.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared on national television that India would be under lockdown for twenty-one days in order to prevent the spread of the global pandemic COVID-19 (Coronavirus). The decision of the Prime Minister was made two days after he had advised the citizens of India to follow the Janta Curfew, which was a voluntary curfew. The Janta Curfew acted to prepare Indian citizens for the current lockdown.

The Ministry of Home Affairs <a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Annexure_MHA.pdf">published</a> the official notification and invoked the lockdown under <a href="https://ndma.gov.in/images/ndma-pdf/DM_act2005.pdf">Section 6</a> of the Disaster Management Act. The Home Secretary issued guidelines for this lockdown under his powers in Section 1<span>0</span> of the Disaster Management Act, as the Chairman of the National Executive Committee constituted under Section 8 of the Act.

It is surprising to see that the terms ‘lockdown’ and ‘curfew’ have not been defined under Indian law but are still being used to curtail the fundamental right of movement enshrined under <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/constitution-india/constitution-india-full-text">Article 19(1)</a> of the Indian Constitution. This cannot be termed invalid as this right is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). The closest understanding of ‘lockdown’ can be construed from the Epidemic Diseases Act (<a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">EDA</a>). Section 2 and 2A of the EDA give power to the State and Central governments to take necessary steps in the situation of an epidemic to control its outbreak, even if the steps are not mentioned in any law practice or theory in the country.

Looking to the the Disaster Management Act, which was used to enforce the lockdown, Section 2(d) reads: “‘Disaster means a catastrophe, mishap, calamity or grave occurrence in any area, arising from natural or man-made causes, or by accident or negligence which results in substantial loss of life or human suffering or damage to, and destruction of, property, or damage to, or degradation of, environment, and is of such a nature or magnitude as to be beyond the coping capacity of the community of the affected area.” This section is not meant to deal with epidemics or diseases of any kind but causes such as, but not limited to, tsunamis and earthquakes. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs declared the spread of COVID-19 as a “notified disaster”, thus bringing into play Section 2(d) of the Disaster Management Act. This enabled the State Governments to use a larger part of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to combat the spread of the virus.

It is interesting to see that when the lockdown was announced, its application was not sourced from any law. It is not explicitly provided anywhere that the government has the power to declare something of this nature. It looks as if the policy had first been declared, and then the later the government considered which law applied. Declaring the COVID-19 outbreak as a “notified disaster” is a first-of-its-kind measure taken to increase the scope of government powers that can be used in order to make quick administrative decisions to fight this disease. It is important for the government to back its policies and decisions with legal provisions as it validates those actions.

In furtherance of the declaration of a nationwide lockdown, the Ministry of Home Affairs published guidelines using Section 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act on the measures State and Central Governments must take during this twenty-one day period. The guidelines <a href="https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/MHA%20order%20dt%2015.04.2020%2C%20with%20Revised%20Consolidated%20Guidelines_compressed%20%283%29.pdf">established</a> that all types of transport services (air, train, and road travel) will not be operational during this period. Commercial and private establishments shall remain closed, except for ration shops, banks, ATMs, media services, and telecommunication companies. The guidelines also said under paragraph 17 that any person who violates these containment measures will be liable under Sections 51 to 60 (Offenses and Penalties) of the Disaster Management Act, and under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1432790/">Section 188</a> of the Indian Penal Code which creates the punishment for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant.

In the case of <u>Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity V State of West Bengal</u>, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.escr-net.org/caselaw/2006/paschim-banga-khet-mazdoor-samity-ors-v-state-west-bengal-anor-cited-1996-air-sc-2426">held</a> that the government is obligated to provide adequate health facilities to the citizens of India. But the current status of medical facilities (including, but not limited to, testing kits, hospitals, and the number of people trained to combat something of this nature) suggests that India needs something more than a Disaster Management Act or an Epidemic Diseases Act that only grants powers to the government to take steps they deem necessary. India requires a methodological and comprehensive framework to combat a pandemic of this nature.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Julian Assange is an Australian hacker, famous for revealing US secrets relating to war crimes committed in Iraq and Afghanistan. A whole cache of classified information was published by Assange's organization WikiLeaks, which revealed the details of the ruthless murders of innocent civilians and the capture of hundreds of innocent civilians in the US’s Guantanamo Bay Prison. Assange was able to do this with the help and assistance of whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, a former US Army Intelligence analyst. She had access to the classified information and passed it on to WikiLeaks.

Assange was able to procure such confidential information through a program he developed. As a programmer, he created a platform for whistle-blowers to send information to WikiLeaks anonymously. This technological finesse helped him get his hands on top-secret information without compromising the security and identity of the information provider. Chelsea was exposed not through WikiLeaks, but through online correspondence, Adrian Lamo sent this information to the US Army’s Criminal Investigation Command. Chelsea was arrested and tried on twenty-two separate charges and subsequently jailed for them. She may be considered a hero since her original sentence was commuted and she preferred to go to jail again rather than testifying against Assange.

<strong>Charges Against Assange</strong>

On April 11, Assange was forcibly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/11/julian-assange-arrested-at-ecuadorian-embassy-wikileaks">arrested</a> at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and was heaved into Belmarsh Prison for alleged violations of his bail contracts. Assange now faces extradition to the US where he may face jury indictment on charges of illegally hacking into a government computer. The indictment clearly states that Assange is charged for conspiring with Manning to hack government computers to obtain highly classified and secret information. The eighteen charges against him arise from the highly controversial and barbaric <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title18/part1/chapter37&amp;edition=prelim">Espionage Act</a>. Never before has this act been used against media groups or publishers.

A difference in opinion regarding criminal charges against Assange appear between different US Administrations: The Obama Administration rejected criminal charges against Assange claiming it would hamper freedom of the press. Even in Edward Snowden’s case, which including the leaking of highly confidential information from the National Security Agency (<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/about/mission-values/">NSA</a>), agencies that published his intel were not criminally charged by the government. Even the current Trump Administration, who previously applauded WikiLeaks for its release of information against rival Hilary Clinton, now supports criminal charges against WikiLeaks.

<strong>Violation of International Law</strong>

Assange was thrown into the Belmarsh prison in April. The special reporter and medical team of the United Nations visited him in May and their report <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25249">stated</a> that Assange presented “all [of] the symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture.” Even though this report demanded immediate healthcare for Assange, the UK Government has outrightly rejected the claims and demands put forward by the Nils Meltzer, special reporter. Nils is of the opinion that this case has never been about Assange’s guilt or innocence, but rather is about the consequences one may face if you try to reveal information against the world’s strongest governments.

Assange is <a href="https://defend.wikileaks.org/liveblog/">facing</a> a trial in the UK for extradition to the US. Before deciding whether Assange is to be extradited, the UK authorities need to evaluate and take into consideration the United States’ approach to international law. The US has even gone as far as <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-8/">calling</a> the International Criminal Court (ICC) illegitimate. The US Secretary of State has already <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/03/15/us-threatens-international-criminal-court">revoked</a> the visa of ICC’s Chief Prosecutor and threatened the court with economic sanctions. The US has a history of withdrawals from international organizations and treaties, which shows that the country only respects international law so long as it is beneficial. Such an attitude hardly supports the extradition of Julian Assange to the US to face a trial.

Under international law, if there is potential psychological torture through extradition then the extradition is rendered illegal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has made it clear that a person who awaits the death penalty, death trial, or where it is possible that evidence against them would be obtained through torture, then that person must not be extradited. In the present case, Julian Assange is facing seventeen charges carrying a minimum of ten years imprisonment in addition to a computer fraud charge of five years imprisonment. But, the treaty between UK and US bars extradition for political offenses. International law does not provide an objective definition for what constitutes a political crime, nor does it clearly <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/international-law-diplomatic-asylum-and-julian-assange">explain</a> the relationship between a general body of law and a regional one. Due to the fact that the Espionage Act has traditionally been used to frame charges against political offenders has also been used to frame charges against Assange, this case appears to be a political one which would bar extradition.

<strong>The Statute of Limitations</strong>

The statute of limitations prevents the prosecutor from charging a person for crimes that were committed more than five years ago.  This five-year limit is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2015/01/14/ccmanual.pdf">applicable</a> for both conspiracy and computer fraud charges. The grand jury returned the indictment just before the eighth anniversary of the day when Assange was accused of conspiring with Manning. So, the question is whether the statute of limitations will apply or not. As it turns out, this statute also contains an exception which states that acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries would have an extended limit of eight years. In this case, the alleged conspiracy transcended national boundaries, but is it an act of terrorism?

The United States Justice Department will have to convince the British Government and Courts that Assange would be given a fair trial and allowed to use any applicable defenses, including the statute of limitations if he is extradited. The British Court has the option of either denying extradition on such legal loopholes or trusting the American Judicial System to provide a fair trial for Assange.

<strong>Concerns About Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression</strong>

Freedom of the press worldwide is already suffering due to stringent measures now followed by various governments to control the media that publishes material against them. The act by WikiLeaks is a common component of journalism. If receiving and publishing information is considered a crime then all the news agencies are criminal organizations.

An attack on Julian Assange is an attack on the fundamental freedom of the press because the secret information was leaked by Chelsea Manning and she served a sentence in jail for it. If anyone should be accused or charged for breach of security, it is Chelsea Manning. If the US wants to hold the press responsible then why leave out The Guardian, The Washington Post or the New York Times. Another question that arises here is: did Assange conspire to hack US secret documents, or did he just accept information which was provided to him by a whistle-blower? It appears he only accepted the information which was passed onto him. A distinction must be made between a reporter who steals and leaks information and one who only reports it to the general public. Assange did not leak information for personal gain. He revealed the information for the public good. He exposed the war crimes committed by the US. The Pentagon Papers case was also based on the leak of classified information.  In that case, the US Supreme Court stated that the New York Times had the right to publish that information under the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of the press.

According to the Guardian’s editor, Katharine Viner: “State power should never be used to suppress the actions of whistle-blowers and investigative journalists pursuing stories that are clearly in the public interest. The US extradition case against Julian Assange is a troubling attack on press freedom and the public’s right to know.”

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Charging a publisher for exposing valuable information for the public good is indeed detrimental to press freedom worldwide. If such a precedent is set, then the complete demise of respect for international law and press freedom is soon to come.

		<title>Rethinking Food Insecurity During a Pandemic: An Equity-Based Approach</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In just a few weeks, COVID-19 has overwhelmed the world and drastically changed our lives. Arvind Suresh, a medical student and Albert Schweitzer Fellow, has begun to research the impact that “stay at home” orders and social distancing have on communities with longstanding challenges with food insecurity.

For the vast majority of us, only grocery store trips remain on what was once a long list of routine activities outside the home. Yet, even this simple activity is now subject to external stressors as the current outbreak exacerbates the inequities and food insecurity that many households already face. In rural New Hampshire and Vermont, where Arvind’s medical school, Dartmouth, is located, there are large <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf">food deserts</a> with no grocery stores for over 30 miles. In these regions, there is a large proportion of low-income households, inadequate access to transportation, and a limited number of food retailers providing fresh produce and healthy groceries at affordable prices. As a consequence, many communities may rely on the local convenience store to meet the majority of their nutritional needs. As nutrition status is closely <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/10/1582/294025">linked</a> with the immune system’s ability to mount an effective response against infectious agents such as the coronavirus, this puts communities living in food deserts at a higher risk for complications and death without adequate nutrition.

Arvind is partnering with Little Rivers Health Care, a Federally Qualified Health Center with offices in rural northeastern Vermont tasked with improving food access and nutrition literacy. The Little Rivers service area includes the largest food desert in Vermont. Although Congress has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved">passed</a> legislation expanding federal benefits through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and waived requirements for school districts to provide meals to children, these primarily reactive measures do not address the underlying problem. In response to growing patient needs and lackluster support from federal and state programs, health centers like Little Rivers have had to take matters into their own hands by repurposing staff to deliver food to patients.

<strong>Making Food Policy Work for Everyone</strong>

Even before the pandemic, one in seven Americans relied on food banks to ensure they had enough to eat. With the rising unemployment numbers each week, these needs are only rising and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article">leading</a> to long lines at food banks that are running empty without access to their normal food sources and donations. Congress, therefore, needs to do more to support community-oriented approaches to support food delivery rather than a one size fits all approach. FEMA should be deployed directly to hard-hit communities to support the work of nonprofits and engage in public-private partnerships. Such an approach would ensure food banks are adequately stocked and aid in deliveries to rural communities that are not well-connected to the food system.

There is also a need for comprehensive legislation that addresses the long-term impact of this public health crisis on our food system. Current data already suggest that our commercial distribution network is not capable of readily adapting to unexpected changes in product demand.

Few policies are in place to support farm workers who are producing an adequate supply but are being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html">forced</a> to plow over fields and dump gallons of milk they cannot sell. Flexibility could be afforded to federal and state governments to purchase food directly from farmers and redistribute them as needed to food banks. This would ensure that families are not going hungry while also supporting the livelihood of farmers so they are able to sustain their operations and support their workers.

According to a brief <a href="https://www.chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Home-Delivery-Issue-Brief-Final.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0-DaX0KE7fssTGd5hb8D6qC6M36hKVd02OXME34_wF45RsCzacWHDWSm4">prepared</a> by the Food Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School, there is flexibility in existing statues that has not been used to the fullest extent possible. For example, the 2018 <a href="https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/2018-farm-bill">Farm Bill</a> has already established a precedent for allowing online purchasing with SNAP. Yet only a few states, including New York and Washington, are currently offering online purchasing in a pilot program for SNAP recipients. No such effort has been made to implement such a program nationally. For vulnerable families who rely on WIC and SNAP, this inability to purchase food online or get free delivery widens their inequity in food insecurity, increases their exposure to COVID-19, and puts even greater stress on an already faltering food supply chain.

<strong>Balancing Public Health Needs and Individual Rights</strong>

Relating to Arvind’s work, about twenty minutes from Dartmouth, Vermont Law School Juris Doctor student and fellow Albert Schweitzer Fellow Matthew Fischer is considering various emergency public health intervention methods, such as social distancing, and their potential for inadvertently violating individual and human rights. What sacrifices can be deemed necessary to protect public health and the public’s best interest?

There is a false dichotomy being presented to Americans in today’s discourse around positive and negative rights surrounding issues of public health. Communities throughout the country have begun protesting that their civil liberties are being infringed upon by stay-at-home orders and closed businesses.

According to Ronald Bayer, a professor at the Center for the History and Ethics of Public Health at Columbia University, public health and human rights do not need to be in opposition. Bayer explained, “good public health respects civil liberties, and anything that advances human rights and civil liberties would advance public health.”

In Mississippi, Temple Baptist Church is suing the City of Greenville (<u>Temple Baptist Church v. City of Greenville</u>) for violating its first amendment right to freedom of religion. The city sent eight uniformed officers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/23/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-drive-in-church.html">end</a> a drive-in service even when nobody was outside of their vehicle or in close contact with each other. The actions of cities like Greenville are incongruous with their intended goals when they do not carry a clear public health benefit. While religious gatherings are prohibited, state and local governments are largely ignoring the public health consequences of forcing communities to gather at the single grocery store in a food desert to buy food and allowing farmworkers to live in close quarters because they are deemed essential workers.

If governments are given so much leeway in the name of protecting public health, they should do more to address the needs of the most vulnerable. A government that preserves both positive and negative human rights would be able to ensure that individuals living in rural communities are able to meet their nutritional needs, as well as provide farmworkers and grocery store workers with the protections necessary to avoid unnecessary exposure.

Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown Law suggests a way forward to meet public health demands while maintaining basic individual rights during a pandemic. He proposes that officials ask the following questions when deciding the pros and cons of a public health intervention such as social distancing:

· Is there evidence that an individual/group pose(s) a significant risk?
· Is the measure the least restrictive option to meet the public health needs?
· Are the measures used supported by the public?
· Do the people have access to due process to challenge the intervention if desired?
· Is the intervention discriminatory or arbitrary?

Simply put, food insecurity is an injustice that during the current pandemic has revealed broader problems with our food distribution network and public health infrastructure. Government entities like Congress and FEMA should prioritize addressing the root cause of these problems through public-private partnerships that will help sustain our communities well into the future. Creative and sustainable policies implemented now can ensure both equitable food availability and support ongoing efforts to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Rather than viewing public health and civil liberties as opposing forces, a truly robust public health framework can balance both while building solidarity around the human rights necessary for our communities to thrive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>Dawn Raids</span> refer to various surprise search and seizure activities conducted by Antitrust Agencies in order to catch suspects off guard. Dawn raids are inherently intrusive in nature and therefore conducted sparingly to unearth the evidence to establish an anti-competitive practice. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1657456/">Section 41</a> of the Competition Act, read with <a href="http://corporatelawreporter.com/companies_act/section-220-of-companies-act-2013-seizure-of-documents-by-inspector/">Section 220</a> of the Companies Act, empowers the Director-General of investigation to conduct a search and seizure operation after obtaining necessary permissions, if there exist reasonable grounds to believe that documents relating to the infringement are likely to be destroyed, mutilated or falsified.

There is a considerable lack of literature surrounding antitrust dawn raids in India. Furthermore, considering the wide scope and ambiguity of the term “reason to believe”, there is a need to find a middle ground approach to preserve business rights and interests, and promote effective competition investigation at the same time. This article aims to analyze the issue in a holistic manner and provide some suggestive measures to prevent these dawn raids from turning into “fishing expeditions”, which are harmful to business interests.

<strong>Background and Certain Procedural Aspects</strong>

Since dawn raids are invasive in nature, the following <span><a href="https://www.mondaq.com/india/antitrust-eu-competition-/792604/advent-of-dawn-raids-in-india-a-case-of-aggressive-anti-trust-regime">procedural</a> aspects </span>are to be observed before conducting any dawn raid:
<ol>
 	<li>DG is the investigating arm of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and is required to be <strong>impartial </strong>during investigation. The CCI may direct the DG to investigate anti-competitive practices without seeking any comments or representation by the party being investigated.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>An unexpected raid can be conducted by the DG only on <strong>reasonable grounds of suspicion</strong> that evidence that would uncover anti-competitive practices are likely to be destroyed or mutilated.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>The most important and logistical pre-requisite is to obtain the <strong>authorization</strong> for carrying out a raid by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, the logistical requirements that are to be completed before the dawn raid is conducted act as safeguards against unscrupulous exploitation. In the JCB <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/62956320/">case</a>, the <span>CCI</span> directed the DG to furnish a personal affidavit indicating that the material available before it and the DG’s reasons for conducting the dawn raid were compelling enough to justify it. The dawn raid in the JCB case was the first-ever to be conducted in India and formed part of the investigation into JCB India Limited's alleged abuse of its dominant position.

<strong>Dawn Raids Under The Competition (Amendment) Bill Of 2012</strong>

The aforementioned bill was introduced in Lok Sabha in December of 2012 with the following highlights regarding dawn raids:
<ol>
 	<li>The Chairperson of the CCI may direct the DG to conduct a dawn raid if during the investigation the investigator has a <strong>reason to believe</strong> that the party has concealed or omitted to provide some vital information or documents or if there exists any threat of the evidence getting distorted or destroyed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reasonable force</strong> can be used by the authorities to carry out the dawn raids.</li>
</ol>
The bill itself adds teeth to the investigating powers of the DG but simultaneously puts checks and balances on the arbitrary use of this power by the DG. The DG gets the authority to conduct a dawn raid only if he has sufficient “reason to believe” that a dawn raid is the only tool that can expose relevant information of the defaulting party.

However, it must be noted that the judicial history of the term “reason to believe” has <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1300646/">shown</a> that it has wider <span>connotations</span> and, according to many <span><a href="https://www.vantageasia.com/dawn-raids-amendment-small-step-or-giant-leap/">experts</a></span>, the Commission might undertake fishing activity in the garb of dawn raids. For example, in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1426176/">case</a> of <u>Rai Bhadur Seth Sreeram Durga Parasd Ltd. Visakhapatnam</u>, the Court noted that “it is not possible to lay down precisely or exhaustively as to what constitutes ‘reason to believe’”. It would depend on various circumstances. The process of issuance of a warrant may involve the following elements:
<ol>
 	<li>article of search</li>
 	<li>place in which they are hidden</li>
 	<li>manner in which they are hidden</li>
 	<li>the person who is in possession of the articles of search or the place where they are hidden</li>
</ol>
The Departmental Authorities may issue a warrant even if they do not know for certain the name of the person who is in possession of articles of search or the place where they are hidden. All that the court can consider is whether there are grounds that prima facie justify the statement in the warrant by the warrant officer. Further, the bill clearly omits the judicial check by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and is highly criticized for bestowing unfettered power on the Commission.

<strong>Dawn Raids In Other Jurisdictions</strong>

Mature competition law jurisdictions, like the European Union (EU), have extensive laws relating to the subject of dawn raids by virtue of precedents. A number of <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=CF656956FB4E797BFE93E59CAD979109?text=&amp;docid=140725&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=3023017"><span>rulings</span></a> by the European Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/001-111890?TID=qtqsnbsdnw"><span>suggest</span></a> that a dawn raid should be justified by some degree of suspicion. The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:61987CJ0046&amp;from=HU"><span>obligation</span></a> to specify the subject matter and purpose of the investigation is a fundamental requirement in order to justify the raids. Although, <span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32003R0001&amp;from=EN">Article 20</a> of EU Regulation 1/2003,</span> which empowers the Commission to conduct dawn raids, does not contain an explicit provision to the same effect.

The fact that the <span>Commission must <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1051228/FULLTEXT01.pdf">have</a> reasonable grounds o</span>f suspicion on targeted companies for unlawful behavior implies that it would be likely that the evidence sought is to be found at the premises searched. Further, searches of roving or <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-135/09&amp;language=EN">fishing</a> to find incriminating documents are not permissible in law. Before ordering or commencing a search, the <span>authority</span> must have sufficient material to form reasonable belief that such a search is necessary. Similar <a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/law-faculty-publications/193/">criteria</a> are applied in fulfilling the probable cause standard in the <span>United S</span>tates.

<strong>Inherent Safeguards In The European Union: The Proportionality Doctrine</strong>

Search and Seizure operations limit the rights of individuals and companies. It is therefore important that such limitations should serve a legitimate purpose and be necessary, reflecting the <span><a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1051228/FULLTEXT01.pdf">principles</a> of proportionality</span>. The proportionality principle is one of the main grounds to challenge dawn raids conducted by the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:61979CJ0136&amp;from=HR"><span>Commission</span></a> in the European Union.

The European Court of Justice in the landmark case <span><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&amp;num=C-94/00">Roquette Frères</a></span> stipulated that the national courts have the task of ensuring that, in the specific circumstances of each individual case, the coercive measures used carry out the inspection are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the subject-matter of the investigation. The court further observed that:
<blockquote>“It must be open to the competent national court to refuse to grant the coercive measures applied for where the suspected impairment of competition is so minimal, the extent of the likely involvement of the undertaking concerned so limited, the evidence sought so peripheral, that the intervention in the sphere of the private activities of a legal person, which a search using law-enforcement authorities entails, necessarily appears manifestly disproportionate and intolerable in the light of the objectives pursued by the investigation”.</blockquote>
An important aspect of the proportionality analysis is the necessity, or least restrictive means, test. The <span>necessity <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/proportionality/6E9C523D5653FEE453068DEFECF4C4F5">test</a></span> asks that the use of the measure in question is required, or if the purpose cannot be achieved through the use of any other means that would equally satisfy the purpose of investigation.

Further, the proportionality test seeks to determine whether the combination of certain levels of rights-enjoyment combined with the achievement of other interests is acceptable. The <a href="https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/dawn-raids-under-challenge-9781509920150/"><span>test</span></a> essentially determines the balance between two competing interests; that of an effective competition enforcement and the right of an individual or company not to subjected to disproportionate measures.

The proportionality test is an apt mechanism to effectively balance the business interests of enterprises and effective competition investigations. Considering the cemented <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/">adoption</a> of the doctrine to scrutinize state measures in India, courts must extensively adopt the doctrine in hearing challenges to search and seizure operations.

<strong>Poisonous Tree Or Exclusionary Doctrine</strong>

The legal doctrine of “fruits of the poisonous tree” was established in the United States. The fruits of a poisonous tree <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asaferconnecticut/tmy/0128/Lawrence%20S.%20Jezouit%203.pdf"><span>doctrine</span></a> stipulates that if the source of the evidence (the “tree”) is poisoned, then anything gained from it (the “fruit”) is poisoned as well. The books and records apprehended in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/232/383/">Weeks v. United States</a> were the first creation fruit of an unlawful search and seizure. They were not included as evidence because:
<blockquote>“If letters and personal credentials can thus be seized and used as evidence in a criminal trial against an accused of an offense, the safeguard of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be protected against such searches and seizures is of no significance, and, so far as those placed are apprehensive, might as well be incapacitated from the Constitution.”</blockquote>
However, since the <u>Weeks</u> case, “fruits of the poisonous tree” jurisprudence has developed significantly. It has been <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/371/471/">ruled</a> that the doctrine has no application when the connection between the lawless conduct of the authorities and the discovery of the challenged evidence has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.

The doctrine has been applied in Europe as well. In <span>ITC Film Distributors Limited</span>, the courts <a href="https://ucl.rl.talis.com/items/136AB0A8-18F0-F404-32C4-EBE7D5752B8B.html">excluded</a> evidence that had been obtained illegally. Further, the <span>exclusionary <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/367/643/">rule</a></span> protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and excludes any evidence which has been gathered through an illegal search and seizure.

Although more suitable for criminal proceedings, the doctrine has been indirectly applied in competition cases as well. For example, in the landmark case of <u><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-583/13&amp;language=EN"><span>Deutsche Bahn</span></a></u> the Commission dawn raided the premises of Deutsche Bahn and some of its subsidiaries. The ECJ opined that the Commission had proceeded to procure evidence falling outside the scope of the inspection. The Commission’s agents possessed information unrelated to the subject matter of the inspection and proceeded to seize documents falling outside the scope of that inspection. This failure, in turn, “poisoned” the second and third inspection decisions because the Commission relied on information it discovered during the first inspection.

<strong>Conclusion: Suggestive Measures To Adopt</strong>

India has mostly relied on the Competition Law of European Union to develop its jurisprudence and so the ‘poisonous tree doctrine’ (as far as search and seizure operations are concerned) has not been directly adopted in India. There exists a huge gap of legislation covering illegal dawn raids and unscrupulous exploitation of small players in the market. India should partially adopt the doctrine so as to not completely nullify the raid in cases with relevant evidence. A solution could be to start new investigations on the basis of the information and evidence obtained upon legal search operations.

The procured evidence can be used as bait to reveal any possible concealment of anti-competitive activities. Secondly, Competition Law should have sufficient provisions deterring the CCI from conducting fishing expeditions in the garb of dawn raids. Thirdly, any innocent party upon which such a fishing expedition is carried out should be amply compensated and should be free to retrieve all the documents found during the search and seizure operation. Lastly, the proportionality doctrine should be adopted to ensure that over-arching abusive measures are not carried out by the Commission.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The spread of COVID19 has led to a lot of chaos. In the wake of several instances of lockdown violations and quarantined patients <span><a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/coronavirus-man-flees-isolation-ward-in-kerala-brought-back/article31030229.ece">escaping</a></span> hospital wards, the government has <span><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-to-geofence-people-in-home-quarantine/article31111791.ece">decided</a></span> to use an <span><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-geo-fencing-app-will-be-used-to-locate-quarantine-violators/article31241055.ece">application</a></span> that triggers e-mails and SMS alerts to an authorized government agency if a person has jumped quarantine or escaped from isolation. Lockdown is an essential step in containing the virus and preventing its transmission. Geofencing is an efficient way to maintain the lockdown as it is not labour intensive like police patrolling and is similar to mobile tracking, which makes it user friendly for the police.

However, unregulated use of such technology might lead to a breach of privacy rights and misuse of the data being provided by the citizens to such apps.

<strong>Geofencing &amp; COVID19</strong>

Geofencing is a feature in a software program that uses the GPS or RFID to define geographical boundaries. Based on its configuration, it can trigger text messages, send <span><a href="https://www.manatt.com/Insights/Newsletters/Advertising-Law/Massachusetts-AG-Fences-off-Geofencing-Ad-Campaign">targeted advertisement</a></span> on social media, <span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/drones-invisible-fence-president/518361/">control vehicles</a></span>, disable certain technology, etc.  Some geofences are set up to <span><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2383123/geofencing-explained.html">monitor activity</a></span> in secure areas, allowing management to see alerts when anyone enters or leaves a specific area. Geofencing is already being used in <span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/kerala-police-quarantine-surveillance_in_5e7c801ac5b6cb9dc19ae2d9">Kerala</a></span> to help the authorities maintain the lockdown and track the people leaving their house. The mobile app which is being used for geofencing is known as COVID-19 Quarantine Alert System (CQAS).

There are also other countries trying to maintain public order and their respective quarantine period by the application of the geofencing technology.

Recently, the government of Hong Kong undertook a similar measure by introducing electronic tracker wristbands which alert the authorities about the people violating <span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51921515">14 days quarantine</a></span> period. These wristbands are based on the principles of <span><a href="https://qz.com/1822215/hong-kong-uses-tracking-wristbands-for-coronavirus-quarantine/">geofencing</a></span> technology, which is different from GPS tracking. The Hong Kong government has argued that the wristband poses <span><a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1515386-20200318.htm">no privacy concerns </a></span>because it does not track one’s exact location and merely looks at signals to deduce whether someone is inside or outside of the home.

These bracelets contain a QR code that pairs up with a smartphone app by the name of <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.compathnion.equarantine&amp;hl=en&amp;showAllReviews=true">StayHomeSafe</a></span>, which uses the strength of surrounding communications signals like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS to track a person. If someone tries to breach the quarantine by leaving their home, the app triggers a warning and alerts the government. Anyone violating their quarantine could face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to HK$25,000 ($3,200).

Other countries like Australia are using conventional ways like <span><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-06/phone-tracking-follows-movements-of-couple-with-coronavirus/11935912">phone tracking</a></span> to monitor infected people, whereas, some like Taiwan are using an electronic security <span><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3899718">monitoring system</a></span> that will allow easier tracking of all quarantined individuals.

<strong>Legitimacy of Geofencing in India</strong>

The action of the government seems to be legitimate enough based on the fact that it has been reinforced with the help of a legal statute. The <span><a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/in/in119en.pdf">Indian Telegraph Act (1885)</a></span> governs the use of wired and wireless radio communications, digital data communications and gives exclusive jurisdiction and privileges to the government for establishing, maintaining, operating, licensing and oversight of all of these.

As per Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, the Central as well as State Government can carry out lawful interception of phones and computers. However, if done illegally, it is a punishable offence under Section 25 and Section 26 of this act, with an imprisonment up to 3 years in addition to a fine at the discretion of the court.

Although, in the <span><a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_24-Aug-2017.pdf">case</a></span> of <em>Justice KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India</em>, the court said that if any such limitation is to be put on the right to privacy, it will come under the ambit of ‘reasonable restriction,’ and the reasons for imposing such limitation should meet the requirements and criteria for ‘reasonable restriction.' In this case since COVID19 has been declared a <span><a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">pandemic</a></span> and steps are being taken for the maintenance of public order and preventing the spread of this virus, it seems to be a justified restriction.

<strong>Breach of Privacy</strong>

CQAS collects phone data, like the device’s location, on a common secured platform and alerts the local agencies in case of a violation by patients in isolation. It also prepares a list of mobile numbers, segregates them on the basis of telecom service providers and location data provided by the companies, which is further used by the application to create geo-fencing. Therefore, there is a probability of misuse of location data by the telecom companies.

India is not a party to any international convention on protection of personal data like the <span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-does-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-govern_en">General Data Protection Regulation </a></span><span>(GDPR)</span>, which aims to simplify the regulatory environment for usage of personal data by companies. However, there are certain provisions of some existing statutes which might be able to deal with the possible misuse of data. Nevertheless, India is a party to the <span><a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></span>, which acknowledges the Right to Privacy.

The 2000 Information Technology (IT) Act was recently <span><a href="https://hyderabadpolice.gov.in/acts/ITAct2000-2008(amendment).pdf">amended</a></span> by the government to cater to the need of <span><a href="https://www.dsci.in/content/faqs-it-act-2000-amendments-2008">data protection</a></span>. This resulted in the inclusion of Section 43A and Section 72A, which give a right to compensation for improper disclosure of personal information. Based on Section 43A a certain set of <span><a href="https://meity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/GSR313E_10511(1).pdf">guidelines</a></span> known as the Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information Rules (SPD) were framed. Similar to the GDPR, they set out some necessary procedures for the collection, storage and use of personal data. These rules can be used as a patchwork of legislation to deal with issues regarding data privacy. However, neither the IT Act nor these rules provide for any penalties or punishments in case of any misuse of data. The Data Protection Bill, which has been delayed for a long time is capable enough to tackle most of the issues regarding data privacy and data protection, but it is still under discussion.

Therefore, without any such statutory regulation there are chances of misuse of the personal data of citizens. In the case of geofencing, there have been prior instances of it being misused in the marketing industry. Recently, some <span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/publications/litigation_journal/2018-19/summer/legal-ethics-and-geofencing/">anti-abortion groups</a></span> in the US were using geofencing to identify and send content to women visiting abortion providers. This would be a grave violation of human rights and, as India recently recognized right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, it would also result in the violation of the Fundamental Rights of the citizens. Since, the Fundamental Rights are enforceable only against the State and not private companies, the offenders in such crimes can easily get away with it.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

There is no specific legislation in India to deal with the misuse of data by the companies. The IT Act was not drafted primarily for data protection and cannot cater to the changing dynamics of privacy and data protection. As far as the SPD rules are concerned, despite being framed for the purpose of data protection, they are obsolete in certain aspects. As we know, modern problems require modern solution, special legislation like the Data Protection Bill, is the need of the hour.

		<title>Compulsory Digital Contact Tracing Is Probably Legal, but Still Sub-Optimal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As pressure mounts on state and national leaders to begin reopening the American economy, there are growing questions over whether the government could force citizens to enroll in a digital contact tracing (DCT) program to expedite the identification and isolation of cases of COVID-19. While the legal avenue for such a program is clearer at the state level, the practical implications of a state-by-state approach could yield uneven uptake among states and undermine the entire system once Americans begin to move more freely. Moreover, mandating citizens to enroll in a DCT program could have major repercussions for American democracy and set a dangerous precedent for executive authority. Instead of pursuing compulsory DCT programs, state and federal leaders ought to ensure the developers of these programs integrate insights from behavioral science that maximize citizen uptake.

With the economic consequences of forcing many Americans to spend more than a month in isolation to prevent the spread of COVID-19 becoming clearer, leaders across the country are under pressure to lift lockdowns and reopen businesses. Digital contact tracing (DCT), a process by which the smartphones of sickened individuals can automatically notify others who have been in close proximity to the owner, is one strategy officials are considering to transition American society to a new normal.

In order to be effective, however, contact tracing programs <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUyei02fnoAhWklnIEHV6lDloQFjADegQIBxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fapple-google-contact-tracing-wont-stop-covid-alone%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bP02hRFn1UbstL02KhITp">need</a> the participation of about fifty to sevety percent of the population. Given such a high participation requirement, some experts are wondering if participation in these programs should be compulsory for smartphone users. This raises a number of legal and practical questions: would a compulsory DCT program be legal or practical at the state level? What about at the federal level? What are the implications of a compulsory DCT program, and are there any other strategies that could maximize citizen uptake?

<strong>Could a Compulsory DCT Program Be Legal at The State Level?</strong>

Yes. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth</a> Amendment to the US Constitution vests powers not explicitly granted to the federal government in the states. This includes so-called police powers, or the ability of states to enact strict laws to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens. While the Supreme Court has been reluctant to define or limit these powers, it has explicitly <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/197/11#writing-type-1-Harlan">affirmed</a> states’ ability to enact quarantine and “health laws of every description” necessary to protect public health. Thus, states are well within their right to institute mandatory lockdowns, and the Supreme Court has issued sufficient guidance suggesting a mandatory DCT program would also be permissible.

The Supreme Court’s most relevant <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/">guidance</a> came in <u>Jacobson v. Massachusetts</u>, a 1905 case in which the Court ruled in favor of states’ rights to enforce mandatory vaccination laws. It provided two qualifiers on a state’s use of police powers: (1) these laws must be objectively necessary and (2) they must account for situations when harm caused by the law could outweigh the harm avoided.

States would have little trouble proving DCT programs are objectively necessary. Traditional methods of contact tracing in which a public health official, instead of a smartphone, manages the notification of potentially exposed individuals has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/27/the-disease-always-gets-a-head-start-how-to-handle-an-epidemic-ebola-sars-coronavirus">indispensable</a> in the fight against diseases like Ebola, HIV/AIDS, and other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. The problem with the COVID-19 pandemic is that the disease is so widespread and transmissible. Traditional contact tracing would <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/13/coronavirus-health-agencies-need-army-of-contact-tracers/">require</a> an army of human tracers to be effective in the US. But smartphone technology fixes this problem by rendering the process automated. Moreover, there is already emerging <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-digital-contact-tracing-slowed-covid-19-in-east-asia?ab=hero-subleft-1">evidence</a> that DCT has been effective in combatting COVID-19 in East Asia.

The question whether states could account for situational harm is trickier, but it is not insurmountable. For example, states could prove that they had taken steps to avoid data breaches by ensuring DCT application developers use the latest digital security and privacy protection measures. They could also select DCT applications that collect no location or personally identifiable data from the user, but instead rely on anonymous Bluetooth signals to notify users that have been in close proximity to an infected individual, like the one under <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-google-contact-tracing-strengths-weaknesses/">development</a> by Apple and Google.

Even if the courts deem state-level compulsory DCT programs legal, however, their practicality is much less certain. If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything about states’ behavior, it is that each state is responding differently. While New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/cuomo-de-blasio-new-york-schools">closed</a> schools for the rest of the academic year and <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-nys-pause-extended-until-may-15">ordered</a> nonessential business to remain closed through at least mid-May, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has already begun <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/florida-governor-gives-green-light-for-beaches-to-reopen-2020-04-17">reopening</a> his state’s beaches and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/georgia-brian-kemp-reopen-businesses-coronavirus/index.html">announced</a> that restaurants and movie theaters can begin reopening next week. Once travel restrictions are eased and people begin moving around the country in the summer and fall, people traveling from one state without a compulsory DCT program to another state with such a program (or vice versa) could cause the entire system to break down.

<strong>Could a Compulsory DCT Program Be Legal at The National Level?</strong>

Probably. But a nationally mandated DCT program would need bipartisan approval in Congress. Despite assertions that his “authority is total,” President Trump cannot issue executive orders without any basis in federal law. After President Truman tried and failed to nationalize American steel factories to end a worker strike during the Korean War, Justice Robert Jackson famously <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/343us579">opined</a> in <u>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</u> that presidential authority is only at its pinnacle when he or she acts with the express or implied will of Congress. Thus, until Congress grants the president such explicit authority, he will have little legal recourse for compelling citizens to enroll in a DCT program.

Even if a federally mandated DCT program could clear through Congress, however, it would establish a dangerous precedent and send American democracy down a slippery slope. Assuming a compulsory DCT program would sunset after the crisis subsides, President Trump and his successors could point to the coronavirus era as precedent for reviving these privacy-infringing applications, which becomes especially problematic for crises of lesser severity. Moreover, as Alan Rozenshtein recently pointed out on <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-contact-tracing-privacy-threat">Lawfare</a>, a compulsory DCT program takes a giant step towards enabling the government to restrict the people’s freedom of movement. With a compulsory DCT program in place, one can more easily imagine a scenario in which the government fines individuals for coming into contact with too many people in a given day.

Finally, the government should be mindful of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio">situations</a> in Maryland, Texas, Ohio, and recently <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493672-protestors-demonstrate-against-coronavirus-restrictions-in-pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, where Americans are protesting local lockdown orders. A federally mandated DCT program could further inflame tensions, potentially inciting more protests. These protests would not necessarily need to be in-person to be damaging; a “virtual protest” encouraging people to turn off their smartphones, leave them at home when the go outside, or merely disable their Bluetooth signal would cripple the DCT programs currently under development.

<strong>A Better Option: Insights From Behavioral Science Into a Non-Compulsory Program</strong>

Instead of considering whether DCT programs should be compulsory, government leaders ought to ensure developers use insights from behavioral economics and psychology to maximize citizen uptake.

First, users who own smartphones should be enrolled in DCT applications by default and given the ability to opt out. Apple and Google have already announced that their DCT application will be “opt-in only” even though behavioral economists like Richard Thaler and legal scholars like Cass Sunstein have repeatedly <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~baron/475/choice.architecture.pdf">shown</a> that making participation the default is far superior at increasing uptake. Singapore, which is seeing a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore.html">surge</a> in new infections, released an opt-in DCT application called “TraceTogether” in March, but only twelve percent of the population <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/about-one-million-people-have-downloaded-the-tracetogether-app-but-more-need-to-do-so-for">opted</a> to download it as of April 1. This is far below the fifty to seventy percent threshold experts say is necessary for contact tracing to be effective.

Second, in order to maximize uptake, those choosing to opt-out should immediately be shown figures on how many citizens in their respective city or state are enrolled in the program and the difference that collective participation can make in combating the pandemic. Betsy Paluck, a psychology and public policy scholar at Princeton University, has <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5186d08fe4b065e39b45b91e/t/568de2f4e0327c7b8a288d06/1452139252477/TankardPaluck+2016.pdf">shown</a> how powerful revealing social norms can be at influencing human behavior. She and other psychology scholars like Robert Cialdini, Dale Miller, and Deborah Prentice have <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510500181459?casa_token=VmoxclRWO9sAAAAA:RPEjPLUTzDMRzSB79RS4Crj_PgtsmgdBPzWBTHEFXYfy3bjOFfJzE1fsDJWpmk_Vdwvc8B4K7Cb5fg">shown</a> the extent to which people dislike <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/1134">deviating</a> from social norms, and that people will <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010814-015013">change</a> their own behavior to comply with these norms. Providing a simple statistic to the “opt-outers” showing them that their decision will place them into a socially deviant category could serve as a powerful deterrent from doing so, even if they still object to the idea.

The question of whether a DCT program ought to be compulsory or optional is critical, but it is just one of many legal and practical questions surrounding America’s contact tracing strategy. Robert Chesney recently <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/covid-19-contact-tracing-we-can-live-roadmap-and-recommendations">outlined</a> a number of additional essential features to a planned DCT program, such as sunset clauses, mandatory data-deletion deadlines, access limits, and real-time auditing and public reporting, that ought to be adopted regardless whether the program is mandatory or optional. With the COVID-19 pandemic unfolding so quickly, it is critical for legal and policy experts to play a leading role in ensuring measures taken by the government are ethical and in compliance with the rule of law. It is ultimately on the American people to keep the guardrails on our democracy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The ‘shelter in place’ orders during COVID-19 have resulted in a <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061052">surge</a> in domestic violence in both the U.S. and globally. Isolation is a feature of coercive control, and the quarantine has been used by abusers to further isolate and terrorize women and children. Additionally, COVID-19 is also being used by abusers as a reason to keep women separated from their jobs, supportive networks, including friends and families, and even their children, compounding fear and anxiety.

In communities around the world, the inability to safely contact people outside the home has also cut victims off from necessary services and support. This has had a ripple effect on victim accessibility to shelters, outreach programs, advocacy and judicial systems that help enforce abuser accountability. These are very dangerous times for women and children at risk for domestic and sexual violence.

<strong>Pandemics and Natural Disasters Increase Domestic Violence</strong>

France and Argentina both have reported a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200410-french-domestic-violence-cases-soar-during-coronavirus-lockdown">30%</a> and 25% increase in domestic violence calls respectively. Brazil reports a 40% increase, and Covid-19 has impacted women at risk for domestic violence in infection hotspots in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy and China. In my home state of Minnesota in the U.S., during the first week of the ‘lockdown’ two-thirds of all calls to police were for incidents of domestic violence. COVID-19 has created a perfect storm blending increased need for help, a concurrent decrease in advocacy, and widespread victim isolation.

Because of the risk victims take in seeking help or confronting their abusers, these statistics most likely do not document the real impact of COVID-19 on those most vulnerable. Immigrant and undocumented women are least likely to report violence because of they fear the repercussions of law enforcement involvement, including the potential for deportation. Minority populations continue to be disproportionately incarcerated in the criminal justice system, which can also deter women from seeking help.

Domestic violence thrives in silence and has long been considered a private matter within families. Awareness that abuse happening in the home is a legitimate crime has been growing in recent years. Advocates like Global Rights for Women and other organizations have worked tirelessly to ensure that COVID-19 does not become a free-for-all for abusers.

For this reason, globally, many elected officials and community leaders have stated that keeping shelters is a priority during this crisis. Nonetheless, natural disasters and pandemics create scarcity, and women’s rights and access to services are usually diminished or disregarded in emergencies. There is still much, much more work to do to ensure that COVID-19 doesn’t compound gender and racial inequities.

<strong>Domestic Violence and the Courts</strong>

Insightful leaders in law enforcement and the judiciary who are aware of the dynamics of domestic violence are looking at ways to keep a gendered lens on COVID-19 and serve women at risk and ensure their accessibility to orders for protection. Yet the complications from COVID-19 and the need for social distancing are even more challenging when resources are reallocated.

Even before the COVID-19 crisis systems everywhere need reforms to adequately address the pandemic of violence against women worldwide. Now, advocates are finding that only the most egregious cases of abuse are being handled in law enforcement and the courts because of lack of access for victims. COVID-19 puts a spotlight on how ongoing judicial reform is necessary in cases of domestic and sexual violence.

For example, the requirement for filing orders for protection in person is often a barrier in the best of times, it is extremely challenging now.

The core goal of all domestic violence cases is victim safety, and COVID-19 has put a strain on accessing orders for protection without delays, especially in an emergency.

In the United States, many courts are limiting the days or hours in-person cases are being heard and enforcing the need for social distancing in courtrooms. Some courts are pre-screening visitors for symptoms of the virus and aggressively limiting who may be present for hearings.

In some countries, restrictions in the law make the issuance of orders for protection nearly impossible during COVID-19 social distancing mandates. Even for emergency protective orders, independent evidence may be required that supports victims’ claims of violence and the appearance of the victim in court. In many countries, these emergency orders expire within a few days or even hours before the victim could obtain a longer-term order.

If the victim lives in a community with a curfew or lockdown, they may need permission to travel to a safe house or shelter.

Victims also lose legal aid without a crucial in-person connection to their public defenders and advocates during COVID-19, going into their cases unprepared and without support. In an order for protection hearing, victims usually need to “show cause” and may not have the skills to communicate that effectively to a judge.

The form needed to file an order for protection may be available online, but if internet use is limited by the abuser, or for rural populations, cell phone and internet connection is spotty, it can be challenging to access those forms. Before COVID-19 people in those situations often used a library or community center to gain access to the application, but now they are closed. Victims also may believe the courts are closed even when they are not.

If the victim is a parent, the need for a “first appearance” in court is imperative because of child custody concerns. In cases of child neglect, fact-finding has been postponed until courts fully reopen. Most courts do not allow children to be present in domestic and sexual violence cases, and during COVID-19 people who might help victims are in quarantine, and there are no childcare centers open, except for first responders.

Compound these issues with job loss, insecure housing, lack of transportation, damage to property or medical bills. Getting public assistance for support in these situations is often restricted without an immediate court order.

It is clear that courts need to adapt to these challenges, including holding more remote proceedings to remove some of these barriers. However, not everyone has access to video conferencing tools, and phone calls limit the ability of judges and advocates to ensure the identity and credibility of who is on the phone. Some cases can be held remotely by phone, but some cases are not scheduled at all.

Law enforcement and accountability for abusers is also facing challenges by COVID-19. In many countries, police have been hesitant to make arrests unless there is evidence of physical injury. Arrests may not result in abuser detention because of the fear of the virus in prisons or jails. Conversely, survivors fear infection from the virus and the abuser should they return home from being incarcerated.

<strong>Victim-Centered Solutions</strong>

What <em>are</em> the solutions to these seemingly insurmountable problems? Fortunately, there are people and organizations working hard to find creative solutions that result in justice for victims of domestic and sexual violence. Here’s what will mitigate barriers:

<strong>Train best-practices for victim services.</strong> Cross-cooperation with law enforcement, advocates and the judiciary, also known as a Community Coordinated Response (CCR), is what Global Rights for Women and other systems reform proponents believe is the best approach for victim-centered advocacy with community-driven solutions.

<strong>Enforce perpetrator accountability.</strong> Law enforcement and courts need to weigh the risks to the victim and the community during a natural disaster or pandemic using a gender lens to make determinations.

<strong>Reform barriers to justice.</strong> Acknowledge that the complications victims experience in filing orders for protection are compounded by both the barriers to in-person filing, as well as COVID-19-related barriers.

<strong>Improve access to court proceedings.</strong> Courts need to make better use of technologies to help resolve obstacles and increase access to legal aid. If domestic violence victims cannot access court services, there is often no other remedy or recourse available to them.

<strong>Recognize increased gender-based violence during natural disasters and pandemics.</strong> Public policy and resource allocations should be based on a clear understanding of gender-based violence that supports the most vulnerable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">As the school year nears its end, the important question of how the bar exam will be administered, if administered at all, has been asked multiple times in the era of COVID-19. One option that has been subject to much discussion has been diploma privilege. Under such a system, law students would receive a license to practice law by virtue of graduating from an ABA accredited law school. This proposal gained increased support and notoriety following the release of the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law <a href="https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/documents/292/63885/COVID19-and-the-July-2020-Bar-Exam.03.22.201-copy.pdf">white paper</a>, which suggested diploma privilege as a possible option.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the past few weeks, multiple petitions have surfaced that encourage state supreme courts to adopt diploma privilege. The rise of these petitions has similarly resulted in comments and articles written by those who disagree with such a proposal. In all the conversations, what doesn’t get enough attention perhaps are the various other options, why they are unworkable, and why diploma privilege is the best option on the table.  </span>

<b>1. July Administration </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Of the options that are available, this option does the least to protect public health and safety and should be rejected. While some states <a href="http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-covid-19-updates/july-2020-bar-exam-jurisdiction-information/">intend</a> to administer a July exam with a postponement contingency plan, this option does the least to protect public health and fails to provide certainty.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The reasons to avoid a July exam are numerous. The spread of COVID-19 may rage into the summer, and the absence of an available vaccine may allow the virus to spread for months to come. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Holding the bar exam in July thus forces students to decide between sitting for the bar and protecting their health. Beyond simply the concern for the students taking the bar exam, many students also live with spouses, children, parents, and roommates who may then also be exposed to COVID-19. I, for instance, live with my dad, who will turn 61 this year. This places him in the category of people most vulnerable. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the concerns of safety for examinees and the public, this option lacks certainty. If the virus resurges as social distancing measures are relaxed, as many experts suggests, then that very well means the planned July administration will be postponed. </span>

<b>2. Postponement </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This option has gained support from various state high courts that have weighed in on the matter. However, it creates too much uncertainty. Postponing the exam until fall only creates a situation where the bar may be postponed again. Dr. Fauci <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2020/03/30/the-coronavirus-will-return-in-the-fall-fauci-predicts-but-the-us-will-be-better-prepared/#4fb6a968e39b">suggested</a> that a fall resurgence is not only possible, but exactly what is expected.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/04/15/garcetti-sporting-events-concerts-unlikely-in-los-angeles-until-2021-1276698">suggested</a> that large events may need to be cancelled until 2021.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The same concern that was raised in the previous option- that the virus may resurge- would again resurface under this proposal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A proposal recommending that law students just take the February exam would also not be equitable. Students have bills to pay and student loans will need to be paid back. What students need now is certainty. The blasé manner in which many suggest postponement, without necessarily thinking about what comes next if the proposed date is rendered impossible, shows a lack of forethought and understanding of the precarious position in which students are placed. After three years of education, a recommendation that punts on the exam only creates additional uncertainty in an already uncertain time. </span>

<b>3. Online Administration </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The third option that is suggested by those seeking to justify their opposition to diploma privilege is that the bar exam may be administered online. This presents a variety of separate challenges. The benefit to an in-person bar exam is that it will subject all examinees to like conditions. An online exam, by its nature, fails to do this. Students have lives outside of school and the bar. Many have kids, pets, roommates, and a variety of other distractions in their daily lives that may prevent them from devoting their full attention to a multi-day, multi-hour exam. Some students lack stable WiFi or may not have WiFi at all. Even seemingly inconsequential things may suddenly take on importance. For example, imagine two students, one with central air, the other without it on a humid, 90-degree day. While the idea of bringing up air conditioning seems trivial, it is not. It is an example of an advantage that some test takers would have over others. If all examinees were in the same room and the AC went out, that still subjects all students to the same conditions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Then, there is an issue of cost. To ensure that all students are taking the exam themselves and not attempting to cheat, webcams must be set up with proctors monitoring every student. It seems unlikely that proctors would be able to adequately monitor more than a few students at a time. Hundreds of these proctors would need to be hired. And, of course, those costs will be passed on to those taking the exam. Absent the proctors, issues of honesty then come to the forefront. At the end of the day, online administration creates more trouble and begs more questions than it is worth. </span>

<b>4. Small Group Administration</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For some states, like California, this is already the case. The exam is spread across multiple sites with thousands of test takers at each. However, for many states, like Ohio, the exam is administered in one location. An option that has been proposed is, as opposed to a large testing site, to change to smaller testing sites around the state. However, smaller sites by themselves will not necessarily prevent the spread of COVID-19. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Students will still be in rooms for hours at a time. They will use the restrooms, enter and leave the building, and so on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The question asked about a July exam, about whether students will risk the health and safety of themselves and their families again, is brought to the forefront under such an option. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to online administration, a question of cost also becomes relevant. Depending on how many sites there are, there will need to be dozens of exam administrators. Again, that cost will fall on the examinees. </span>

<b>5. Temporary Licensure </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This option was <a href="https://njcourts.gov/pressrel/2020/pr040620a.pdf?c=emJ">recently recommended</a> by the New Jersey Supreme Court</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Under such a proposal, students will be issued temporary licenses and allowed to practice until such a time when the bar exam may be safely administered. This option is perhaps one of the most tone-deaf of the available options. It is perhaps hard to imagine law firms hiring recent grads as licensed attorneys, knowing that the grads may not be licensed in a year. The most that students in this position can hope to receive is a law clerk position. Even assuming that students can be employed as law clerks, it is a job they will undoubtedly have to quit in order to study for the bar exam. Students frequently study for multiple hours a day. Bar preparation is, itself, treated as its own job. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What’s more, temporary licensure lays to waste the argument that this is somehow a concern about competence of recent grads, as opposed to simply a desire to force those grads to take the same exam that those who graduated in 1997 had to take. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">If there is a question of competence on a permanent basis, it exists on a temporary basis as well. To suggest that this as an option at all shows that competency is not, in fact, the chief concern. </span>

<b>6. Diploma Privilege/Diploma Privilege Plus </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining option is diploma privilege. As previously explained, this option would allow students to receive a license by virtue of graduating from law school. A separate option would allow licensure by diploma privilege in addition to a separate requirement, such as additional Continuing Legal Education hours or supervised practice hours, as has been <a href="http://www.utcourts.gov/utc/rules-comment/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2020/04/04.09.20-PROPOSED-ORDER-re-Bar-Waiver-final.pdf">proposed</a> by the Utah Supreme Court.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This option best balances the needs for safety, certainty, and competency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As an initial matter, it is clear why avoiding large gatherings and providing licenses with set requirements provides both safety and certainty. It meets the competency concern raised, perhaps dubiously, by many in their opposition to diploma privilege. I have heard time and again that law school and the bar do not make lawyers practice ready. One of my professors, who is an exceptional attorney, explained how he had a mentor who showed him the ropes after he graduated from law school. A supervision requirement provides this to all recent grads. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond that, it could be well argued that those who have supervision with diploma privilege will be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> competent than those just taking the bar. The 360 hours of supervision that have been proposed by the Utah Supreme Court amount to over two months of supervision, assuming an 8-hour Monday through Friday schedule. This option- diploma privilege plus an additional requirement- both protects the public and better prepares lawyers for practice in the state in which they seek bar admission. It is the best option on the table, and more state high courts should follow Utah’s example and adopt this provision. </span>

		<title>Implicit Threats of Violence: The American President&#039;s &quot;Trump Card&quot;</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"Whoever can conquer the street will one day conquer the state, for every form of power politics and any dictatorship-run state has its roots in the street." - Joseph Goebbels, Third Reich Minister of Propaganda</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough—until they go to a certain point and then it would be very bad, very bad.” - US President Donald J. Trump</blockquote>
Though seemingly unimaginable in our American democratic society, US President Donald J. Trump continues to dangle implicit threats of violence before his "base." Currently, this authoritarian tactic is most dangerously evident in Trump's calls for the "liberation" of selected states (all with Democrat governors) together with explicit praise of "our great Second Amendment." Such worrisome calls ought not come as a complete surprise.

Back in 2016, and with considerably less subtlety, this president told a wildly cheering rally crowd he'd like to personally assault protesters using direct physical attack. "I love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that when they're in a place like this, they'd be carried out on a stretcher," he said tantalizingly. Then, as an apparent afterthought, but more likely as a carefully rehearsed dog whistle, he became more grotesquely specific: "I'd really like to punch him in the face," were his less than statesmanlike or law-abiding words.

There is pertinent background here. All of Donald Trump's ongoing statements about latent violence and American politics have a distressing historical resonance. In essence, these unpresidential statements are plainly reminiscent of Third Reich propagandist Joseph Goebbels and his abundantly "revealed faith" in "the street." The most tangible difference between Goebbels and Trump, and still a plausibly residual source of reassurance for millions of very worried Americans, is the absence of any <em>Sturmabteilung</em>-type elements in Trump's official retinue.

In Nazi Germany, the SA, until later replaced by Heinrich Himmler's SS, were the first dedicated street fighting cadres. Today, to be sure, Trump would eagerly welcome entire legions of such barbarous elements into his own political ranks, but he has not yet figured out how to accomplish this with sufficiently acceptable levels of lawfulness and respectability. If, however, going forward, he should somehow solve this narrowly tactical quandary, virtually any new presidential derelictions would be possible.

In this connection, Americans should bear in mind that this president is already replacing competent physicians and scientists in the federal government with marginally schooled political cronies. At this time of Covid-19, such replacements are effectively murderous, even potentially <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://search.yahoo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1151&amp;context=ilr">genocidal</a>. They also play havoc with pre-existing legal and statutory safeguards designed to prevent arbitrary or manipulative presidential firings and appointments.

Could a markedly expanding species of presidential wrongdoing soon come to pass? Thankfully, we're not at the corrosive street-fighting level just yet, and presumptively, never will be. Still, though such especially fearful prospects remain more-or-less <a style="cursor: help" title="In strictly mathematical terms, of course, any valid assignments of true scientific probability would be difficult to determine here. In part, this is because probabilities are necessarily a function of pertinent past events and their determinable frequency.">improbable</a>, they are not entirely out of the question. More exactly, we still have no clear picture of the potentially chaotic impact of Covid-19 upon our leaders and populations.

There is more. Should Donald Trump be re-elected, far-right ultra-nationalist groups will likely explode and thrive, all with this dissembling president's unhidden blessings. Should they resort sometime to virulent forms of domestic terrorism, these anti-science and anti-democracy bands could seriously undermine various basic institutions of the American Republic. In the best case scenario, they would still fail to coalesce into a menacing paramilitary force, but this is no longer a world in which "best case" is either inevitable or even plausible. Moreover, with the expected blessings of second-term President Trump, such refractory elements could still wreak havoc upon the United States in other insidious forms.

In whatever form it takes, the stealthily whispered white nationalist threat of mob violence and political disruption is already palpable and real. For now, at least in the Trump White House and among various Trump supporters nationwide, those who would threaten such bitter violence are still viewed by this president as "very fine people." What should this undoubtedly bizarre assessment tell us?

To answer, there are deeply underlying issues here. The <em>mass</em> - that is, virtually any viscerally compliant human group - abhors even the tiniest hints of intellectual exertion or complexity. This stupefying abhorrence is as easily recognizable in Donald Trump's declining presidency as it was back in 1933. "Intellect rots the mind," observed Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's faithful Minister of Propaganda. "I love the poorly educated," chanted President Trump in 2016, not with any impressively refined irony, but with devastating candor and breathtakingly venal sincerity.

Among his dedicated followers, Trump's incessant plea for ignoring history and learning is cheered wildly. Always. Though still one step away from an actual book burning (a favored tactic of the "original" deceiver back in 1930s Weimar Germany), this humiliating plea is now revived almost daily in the American White House and at literally every level of Trump presidential appointment.

There is more. Above all else, the simplification-loving American mass devoted to a presidential Pied Piper yearns to chant in chorus. Surrounded by like-minded followers who have similarly forfeited any once-respectable obligations of independent thought, each grateful member of the Trumpian mass can now "safely" abandon the normally disturbing tugs of individual responsibility. If their strongly favored (in certain cases, even beloved) leader is inherently correct about literally everything because he is "a very stable genius," why should they bother worrying about anything themselves.

"What me worry?" Better just to chant in a rancorous and incoherent chorus. After all, it has happened before.

More than anything else, an illiterate presidential command to follow blindly is what Trump's blatant authoritarianism and his partisan <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-breaking-presidency-save-election-210023583.html">encouragement</a> of national disunity are all about.

Why else (at least pre Covid-19) would these viscerally chanting followers sleep on city streets, in the rain, to get "rally" seats and listen to their charmed leader? Because of the expectedly rare or refined intellectual "insights" of a president who "thinks" only via eruptive spasms of dissembling discourse, and who proudly reads nothing? Nothing at all?

<em>Hardly.</em>

Hurling undimmed howls of execration against all of the "usual suspects" - typically, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, scientists who disagree with him or certain other conveniently out-of-favor television star/athlete/movie actor - this president will never trouble himself with annoying intellectual difficulties of challenging thought. Instead, favoring a noisily national ethos of fitful emotion and eruptive rancor, Donald Trump continuously forces American political and social life toward an uncompromising celebration of both violence and anti-reason. Significantly, the end result of such a deeply corrupted presidential ethos is not difficult to imagine.

<em>Inter alia</em>, it would be a world in which literature, culture and education yield to widening shrieks of loathing directed against learning and "intellectuals." Is it any wonder that Donald Trump's only invited university commencement addresses are always at one or another of the obliging service academies (where polite applause for the "commander-in-chief" are unswervingly <em>de rigeur</em>)?

Now it is time for genuine candor. A president who so patently abhors science and intellect is <em>ipso facto</em> a champion of <em>unreason</em>. In effect, this uniquely degrading quality has become the widely-approved mantra of a consciously disruptive presidency, a watchword that can only lead the United States toward ever-more painful trajectories of stark personal tragedy and cumulative <a style="cursor: help" title="The unassailably worst expression of such a cumulative collective decline would be a nuclear war. For authoritative early accounts by this author of nuclear war effects, see: Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: U.S. Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1984); and Louis René Beres, Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1986). Most recently, by Professor Beres, see: Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (New York, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; 2nd ed. 2018).">collective decline</a>.

To be sure, it's not a comforting mantra.

<em>Credo quia absurdum</em>. "I believe because it is absurd." Left to his own severely limited intellectual capacities, President Donald Trump will continuously encourage unquestioning public obedience to all his purported "ideologies" of demeaning gibberish and chicanery; that is, obedience to compulsively vague banalities and abundantly empty witticisms. "Trade wars and tariffs are good for us," intones this president, always with nary a scintilla of well-reasoned explanation. Earlier, the same fully incoherent sentiments were attached to conceivably prospective military conflicts with North Korea (already nuclear) and Iran (almost nuclear).

<em>Credo quia absurdum</em>.

A 1936 novel by Sinclair Lewis, <em>It Can't Happen Here</em>, details the story of a populist American politician who rises to the presidency upon a hazy platform of crudely simplistic and fraudulent promises. Following his election, "Buzz" Windrip proceeds to impose authoritarian rule upon the dazed country, complete with a new Praetorian Guard. While few in Donald Trump's America want to imagine that any such infringements are possible here, it remains worth noting that the German masses of the 1930s were not in any tangible way deviant, different, criminal or unique.

Not at all.

Presently, watching distressingly homogeneous Trump minions chant mindlessly about "opening up America," winning future wars and garnering global "respect," it would have been quickly evident to Sinclair Lewis that what had earlier transpired among "normal" people in Europe could also emerge among "normal Americans." Again, though any such precisely replicating emergence is unlikely, it is hardly unimaginable. While reactionary and white supremacist elements in this country are not apt to become crudely transformational - even with a US president tacitly complicit on their side - the social and political effects could still become extensively far-reaching and frightfully malignant.

Karl Jaspers, the 20th-century philosopher who most rigorously examined questions of German guilt after World War II, also studied the deeper and more generic issues involved. In his modern classic, <em>Reason and Anti-Reason in our Time</em> (1952), Jaspers had already understood that authoritarian leaderships must always depend upon a suitably docile citizenry. This means, <em>inter alia</em>, a body of citizens that deeply loathes mind-challenging problems and routinely seeks the simplest (but not the best) possible answers. As we may readily learn from 20th century history, these represent superficial and skeletal answers that blame one or more of the usual "suspects" and scapegoats for all currently-endured harms.

In the Third Reich, it was principally the Jews and the Bolsheviks.

In Donald Trump's White House, it is "immigrants" and the "China Virus."

All such contrived answering has a very specific purpose. This purpose, or critical function of orchestrated scapegoating, is to optimally organize the "faithful;" that is, to stifle any still-inconvenient truths and to provide allegedly needed "protections" from insidious alien forces assembling "at the border." Always, for President Trump and his chanting minions for "America First," the <a style="cursor: help" title="This sort of 'us versus them' zero-sum conflict is the mainspring of Trump's orientation to world politics. Still, under authoritative international law, the idea of a universal obligation to global solidarity and interdependence is contained, inter alia, within the core principle of jus cogens or peremptory norms. In the language of pertinent Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969: 'A peremptory norm of general international law....is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole, as a norm from which no derogation is permitted, and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.'">enemy</a> is somewhere" at the border."

Build a fence, and all will be good. Period. All thanks to Jared Kushner and fellow "stable genius" Ivanka.

Almost always, for Donald Trump and his True Believers, the "barbarian" is <em>at the border</em>. Unquestionably, such cartographic insight makes for good politics among those still-considerable Trump minions who chant obediently and (as corollary) strive energetically <em>not to think</em>. In recent months, of course, America has been savaged by disease epidemic, and not by several hundred or several thousand indigent immigrants crossing over from Mexico or Guatemala. Ironically, without these scapegoated immigrants in particular, the American food chain would already have suffered more debilitating supply disruptions.

Sometimes the poet can trump the historian and political scientist. Accordingly, Trump's crude and longstanding authoritarian tactics are elucidated generically by the Greek poet C.P. Cavafy: "What's going to happen to us without barbarians?" he once queried. "Those people were a kind of solution."

Today, the foreseeable goal of expanding anti-reason in Washington is to prevent any still-reasoning Americans from substituting residually clear thought for unquestioned loyalty to the One who calculates from "<a style="cursor: help" title="'The mass-man,' we learn from Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y' Gasset (The Revolt of the Masses, 1930), 'has no attention to spare for reasoning; he learns only in his own flesh.'">his own flesh</a>." Again, for this flagrantly unsteady president, there can never be any good reason to doubt the immutably primal "wisdom" of Joseph Goebbels: "Intellect rots the mind." And said US President Donald Trump as his apt reciprocal, "I love the poorly educated."

Now, for Donald Trump, it goes without saying that endlessly mindless spasms of loyalty are vastly more important than any still-calculable measures of authentic truth. Why not? "What the mass once learned to believe without reasons," inquires Friedrich Nietzsche's <a style="cursor: help" title="Here we may also recall Nietzsche's philosophic warning in Zarathustra: 'Do not seek the higher man at the marketplace.'">Zarathustra</a>, "who could ever overthrow with reasons?"

In serious studies, history still deserves a proper pride of place. Though not widely understood, the Founding Fathers of the United States did not generally believe in democracy. Rather, most unhesitatingly agreed with Alexander Hamilton (recently an improbable Broadway hero) that "the people are a great beast." Thomas Jefferson, arguably the most democratic of the Founders, characterized "the people" as "refuse" from which a small number of prospectively gifted individuals could somehow be culled once each year. More precisely, wrote Jefferson in his <em>Notes on Virginia</em>, opposing mass rule, there should be instituted a plan of elementary schooling by which "twenty of the best geniuses will be raked from the <em>rubbish</em> annually."

These were the actual words of America's third president. It would be a very great irony of US history if the re-election of a quintessential "mass man" in 2020 should lead even more inexorably toward the literal fulfillment of Thomas Jefferson's worst fears about democracy. Before this could happen, however, what would be required is an American president who continued to hurl belligerent howls of execration toward an adoringly obliging mass. This would mean a president and population who just as stubbornly reject learning and properly analytic reasoning as President Thomas Jefferson had once embraced a higher life of science, culture and sincere erudition.

Even in these imperiled and dissembling United States, hope must still remain on the side of sanity. Accordingly, there still exists more-or-less ample opportunity for the American People to strenuously oppose always-multiplying presidential propositions of sheer nonsense. But before "We the People" can suitably reject any insidious replacements of respectable science with a narrowly populist wizardry, something far more palpably primal will be needed.

This "something more" is <em>courage</em>. Following the US Senate impeachment trial, hideous for its one-party "mass" support of a severely deranged chief executive, courage represents the most glaringly missing element from our American body politic. Further, what we desperately need today is less the traditionally recognizable physical heroism of risking one's own life for tribe, nation or cause than an integrity-centered personal willingness to stand firm on behalf for meaning, science and truth. Without such required <a style="cursor: help" title="For incomparably useful lessons concerning this sort of courage in the (usually neglected) American intellectual tradition, we may reconsider basic writings of the American Transcendentalists, most notably Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.">courage</a>, even the most amply gifted scientists and thinkers could sometimes have to surrender their "<a style="cursor: help" title="Sigmund Freud was always darkly pessimistic about the United States, which he felt was 'lacking in soul' and a demeaning place of great psychological misery or 'wretchedness.' In a letter to Ernest Jones, Freud declared unambiguously: 'America is gigantic, but it is a gigantic mistake.' (See: Bruno Bettelheim, Freud and Man's Soul (1983), p. 79.">souls</a>."

History "knows." It has happened before. Barbarism can triumph wherever a national leader can say with utter seriousness: "Intellect rots the mind" or "I love the poorly educated."

In the past, such fateful capitulations were animated by patently hollow policies of flagrant absurdity and dedicated anti-reason. In the future, unless Americans can somehow become substantially more courageous in critical matters of government and politics, these abysmal surrenders could become irreversible and irremediable. Let this be understood: Intellect can never "rot" the mind. It can only enable otherwise indifferent or slavish human beings to take purposeful democratic control of their conspicuously transient lives and always-variable destinies.

The very last thing we ought to welcome in these imperiled United States are further implicit threats of violence from the American president. To best ensure that we won't have to allow such dire <a style="cursor: help" title="At the macro level, one may also think here of the dramatic warning by the High Lama in James Hilton's classic Lost Horizon: 'The storm...this storm that you talk of....It will be such a one, my son, as the world has not seen before.

It will rage until every flower of culture is trampled, and all human things are leveled in a vast chaos....The Dark Ages that are to come will cover the whole world is a single pall; there will be neither escape nor sanctuary.'">threats</a> with impunity, it will first be necessary to remind Americans that intellect and reason must be more seriously valued in our fragile democracy, and that blindly <a style="cursor: help" title="Criminal responsibility of leaders under international law is not limited to direct personal action or by official position.

This article discusses the need to introduce arbitration in the field of Sports law as it will contribute towards the steady disposal of disputes arising on and off the field. We will discuss why there’s an immediate need to promote and bring an efficient form of arbitration into the area of Sports law. We will also overview the functioning of various national and international bodies that govern such issues. The piece also discusses cases where arbitration proved to be an effective way to get the issue addressed at both national as well as international levels. In the end, we will discuss the issues pertaining to the field of sports law and will make recommendations to refine the sports arbitration mechanism.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

Sports has been one of the most significant parts of Indian history ranging from Indus civilization to the Mughal dynasty and further continued in the Colonial era, but still our nation has failed to acquire an effective dispute resolution method to resolve issues arising in the field of sports law.

Early on, the only thing that mattered was sportsmanship and people gained fame and recognition because of their talent and extraordinary skills until bad practices such as corruption, special treatment, labor abuse, drugs abuse and politics started to interfere with the sanctity of sports. In the past, there have been several incidents where sportsmanship has been tarnished by these bad practices which were later taken to court often taking a long time to reach a verdict. The prolonged litigation surrounding these led to delayed delivery of justice to players and other innocent victims on both domestic and international platforms. So, in the present time there’s a need to introduce a new governing authority to tackle such situations. This new authority must deal with sports disputes and render speedy justice with an affordable means. Arbitration must be considered an effective tool while framing sports laws.

<strong>Role of arbitration in the present scenario</strong>

In uncomplicated language, ‘arbitration’ can be defined as an alternate dispute resolution (ADR) method, mutually selected by the parties where an arbitrator is appointed, who after reviewing the case gives a decision legally binding on both the parties. There are several other forms of ADR which including mediation in which the negotiation settlement is facilitated by a neutral third party. Arbitration is noteworthy because it maintains the privacy and confidentiality of both parties by preserving their respective goodwill and reputation which is not the case in litigation, the traditional method for resolving such disputes.

After recognizing such major issues, the Indian government inaugurated India’s first arbitration center in 2009 at Delhi. Because it was leading to the steady disposals of disputes, arbitration became popular among the several methods of disputes resolution. With numerous cases arising daily it’s not viable to use litigation as a mode of dispute resolution.

<strong>Status at International Platform</strong>

The viability of arbitration was acknowledged on the international platform long before when the Centre of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) was set up in <a href="https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/legal/court-of-arbitration-for-sport/">Lausanne</a>, Switzerland by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1983. The Centre of Arbitration for Sports is often <a href="https://www.wada-ama.org/en/court-of-arbitration-for-sport">referred</a> to as the  “Sports supreme court of world” and generally dominates the disputes resolution scene in the international arena. It’s the highest authority where disputes arising between sports personnel and sports federations are settled. In CAS, the effective law is mutually decided by the parties otherwise Swiss law is effective. The <a href="https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Code_2004_internet_.pdf">jurisdiction</a> of CAS is very wide in dealing with disputes arising within sports law between parties defined under section 1 of the code.

CAS is one of the organizations dealing with disputes arising out of sports. Another one was setup in 1994 after the landmark <a href="https://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1102&amp;context=facpub">case</a> of Gundel v. FEI CAS where multiple connections were discovered between CAS and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC was competent to appoint members to CAS, provide funds and even modify the statutes of CAS leading many to question the approach of CAS. This led to the establishment of a supreme body to CAS named the International Council of Arbitration for Sports (ICAS), whose main duty was to protect the independence of CAS by creating a more transparent mechanism for CAS to operate with.

Binding decisions of CAS are limited to parties who fall under the jurisdiction of its courts which excludes non-national parties. This issue was dealt with in the landmark case of Raguz v. Sullivan where one of the two Australian ‘<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2ec/cf57fe0266718794071a0061078bfc114d61.pdf">Judokas</a>’ involved in arbitration, challenged an award by CAS in the New South Wales Court of Appeal. In this case, the court ruled that the CAS agreement for arbitration signed between parties was a foreign agreement not a ‘domestic arbitration agreement’ and declared it out of the jurisdiction of the Australian court of appeal. The court also explained the distinction between the legal seat of arbitration Laussane, Switzerland explicitly stated in the CAS agreement and physical seat of arbitration Sydney, Australia.

CAS has entertained a variety of cases under the ambit of sports law ranging from criminal cases to doping. The <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt86m9b9qr/qt86m9b9qr.pd">well-known</a> ‘Tonya Harding case’ was a hapless case dealing with criminal acts in the sports arena where the victim, Nancy Kerrigan, was brutally attacked during training leaving her unable to participate in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships (USFSC). Due to this her biggest rival Tony Harding won the competition. Later rumors surfaced in the media that Tonya was behind the assault leading to the setup of an investigation. The court held Harding guilty, confiscated the 1994 national title(USFSC) and imposed life-ban from the sanctioned event.

Several countries such as the UK, South Africa, Canada etc have their own independent mechanisms for dispute resolution in sports but CAS has established itself as a “global dispute resolution body.”

<strong>Indian Context</strong>

The present mechanism in the Indian judiciary has led to a huge number of cases being piled up and delayed justice. In India, several organizations make up the governing authorities of issues in sports including the National Sports Policy of India, Sports Authority of India (SAI), The Sports Broadcasting Laws and the Sports Law and Welfare Associations of India. These organizations manage and tend to regulate the issues that arise in the sphere of sports law in the country apart from the courts.

But in the year 2011, the India Court of Arbitration for Sports (ICAS) was <a href="https://blog.ipleaders.in/sports-arbitration-india/">set up</a> as a body to introduce ADR mechanism in the sports realm to resolve disputes in the most efficient way possible. This was done because the lifespan of an athlete is limited and they cannot afford to lose time in litigation. In the famous case where Indian wrestler Narsingh Yadav was caught in a doping controversy ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics, an indefinite hold was put on the wrestler’s career. In that case, the verdict was decided when CAS upheld the World Anti-Doping Agency’s <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/other-sports/story/delhi-high-court-cbi-response-narsingh-yadav-alleged-doping-case-1435583-2019-01-21">appeal</a> against the clean sheet given to him. But there are still several cases experiencing prolonged hearings in courts despite of running lifespan of the athletes in question.

<strong>Contemporary Issues</strong>

<strong>1. Inconsistency in the Mechanism</strong>

Sports Managers in India are currently unaware of the rules and procedural aspects of arbitration which is leading to a delays which must be resolved. The Judiciary, the most primitive mode of dispute resolution, leads to delays in disposal of cases through its prolonged process which has ended the career of several athletes. Judges who adjudicate these matters in normal court may not be experts about the rules and nuances of a particular sport.

<strong>2. Additional issues </strong>

In sports several incidents may take place in the heat of the moment but one inappropriate action can place an athlete in a vulnerable position. Such incidents may include drug abuse, contractual disputes, and labor issues.

<strong>Recommendations and Advantages of the implementation of Arbitration in Sports Law</strong>

Since, sports is at its highest public importance ever, it is necessary for dispute resolution to be effective. Arbitration is a suitable method. It has diversity, swiftness and professionalism. Litigation is not suitable for dispute resolution due to the increasing number of disputes.

The current situation requires that the matters must be adjudicated through arbitration with CAS on the international platform and ICAS on the domestic platform. These specialized forums have a great edge when compared to usual dispute resolution mechanism practiced in normal courts. There are various advantages to the implementation of arbitration as a form of dispute resolution as seen here:
<ul>
 	<li>The arbitrators appointed possess expertise in the intricacies of Sports Law along with the technical knowledge leading to a better understanding of disputes.</li>
 	<li>Privacy and integrity are maintained throughout the process by the parties and officials appointed to adjudicate the matter.</li>
 	<li>The decision given by CAS is globally accepted as per the law and jurisdiction.  Arbitrators appointed by CAS are eminent jurists within the international sports community.</li>
 	<li>It is a steady process setting a time frame within which a dispute has to be resolved. Moreover, having an uncomplicated procedure makes it more convenient.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

In India where sports are considered a religion, sports law is a relatively new field of law to study and faces several issues during the dispute resolution process. With the presence of such issues, players are suffering. Litigation is a long process where the technicalities and nuances are not fully entertained as they can be in Arbitration. Through arbitration both privacy and speed can be taken care of to bring justice to the aggrieved party in sphere of sports law. Thus, there is no doubt that arbitration can be a better option than litigation making the process of dispute resolution in sports law convenient and <a href="http://www.ijal.in/sites/default/files/IJAL Volume 1_Issue 1_Devyani Jain.pdf">promoting</a> the welfare of sports.

		<title>Endometriosis: The Debilitating and Silent Pain Felt by Women Across the Globe</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Women across the globe suffer from painful menstrual cycles in secret. Women are afraid to discuss their pain out of fear of losing their job, getting bad grades in school, and having people not understand what they are going through. Women suffer with pain day-in and day-out and cannot even get help from their doctors. Doctors across the world do not have the knowledge or ability to help treat the painful symptoms women suffer from a disease called endometriosis. Many of these women are diagnosed at first with <a href="http://www.acog.org/">dysmenorrhea</a>, which is defined as severe menstrual pain. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation with the absence of pelvic pathology. When a woman has painful menstrual cycles due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition, she has secondary dysmenorrhea. The most common cause of <a href="https://www.aafp.org/afp/2014/0301/p341.html">secondary</a> dysmenorrhea is endometriosis.

<a href="http://www.endometriosis.org/resources/articles/facts-about-endometriosis/">Endometriosis</a> is a very serious condition where tissue similar to what is found inside the uterus called the endometrium, is found outside the uterus. This tissue outside of the uterus is found in other areas throughout the female body, including but not limited to the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, bladder, and bowel. In rare cases this tissue can be found on the diaphragm and lungs. Endometriosis leaves adhesions and scar tissue throughout the body. These adhesions can bleed and become inflamed causing the abdominal cavity to fill with blood, producing severe, debilitating pain. Women who suffer with endometriosis are susceptible to infertility, loss of reproductive organs, and cancer. Endometriosis affects an estimated 1 in 10 women during their reproductive years, which is approximately 176 million women in the world. Sadly, endometriosis is very hard to detect. Pelvic exams, ultra sounds, and MRIs do not always detect the disease. Many women go years before finding out they have the disease and have the ability to get proper treatment.

In 2018, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://www.endofound.org/underfunded-not-undeterred-women-raise-money-for-endometriosis-research">budgeted</a> an estimated $7 million for endometriosis research, compared to breast cancer research at $755 million and $1.6 billion for cognitive impairment. Endometriosis affects an estimated seven million American women with only about one research dollar per woman with the disease, and causes an estimated $22 billion annually in lost productivity. What has been done to help women through the pain, suffering, and loss of productivity from this debilitating disease?

The Disability <a href="https://www.bloominuterus.com/2015/03/08/readers-choice-endometriosis-as-a-disability/">Evaluation</a> under Social Security known as “The Blue Book” lists impairments that are determined to be so severe as to prevent a person from gainful employment opportunities. The Blue Book does not include endometriosis as a disability. Disability in this instance is defined as “the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s) which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.” The Social Security Administration does not give disability just because an individual suffers from a disease, there has to be a showing of functional limitations. Women can still apply for benefits, but they will have to prove that their endometriosis limits them in a way that they cannot work a full-time job. However, in many instances this would be difficult to prove.

Women also try to turn to companies that provide supplemental insurance to individuals who are recovering from covered illnesses and medical procedures. But not all of these companies cover time off due to endometriosis symptoms, procedures, and hospital stays.

Although endometriosis, in itself, is not treated as a disability, there are countries and companies around the world that recognize the debilitating pain that women suffer during their menstrual cycles through “menstrual leave policies.” Menstrual leave <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/health/period-pain-paid-time-off-policy.html">policies</a> allow women to take a day off during their menstrual cycles without having to use sick time or vacation time. Menstrual leaves are recognized in some countries including, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Zambia. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/eurpe/italy-menstrual-leave-reproductive-health-women-employment-a7649636.html">Italy</a> proposed a law in 2017 that would have mandated companies grant three days of paid leave each month to women employees who experience painful menstrual cycles. However, this law has not been passed. In 2007, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/period-leave-menstruation-work-employment-uk-women-a6905426.html">Nike</a> offered menstrual leave and even went a step further in making its business partners sign a memorandum to guarantee they will follow these standards. In 2017, a handful of private companies located in India started menstrual leave policies as well. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU) started a <a href="https://women-s.net/menstrual-leave-legislation-laws/">movement</a> for paid menstrual leave for women workers at Toyota. Recognizing this disease is the first step in helping those women that are suffering with it.

While menstrual leave and other legislative policies would significantly help those millions of women around the world with endometriosis, others feel that this would cause women to be further discriminated against in the workplace. Menstrual leave is being objected to because it may lead to women getting paid less and stigmatized. Japanese women are known to rarely use menstrual leave for these reasons, and they do not want to be seen as weak. Hopefully, in the near future, the United States and countries across the globe will make strides in funding endometriosis research, and creating legislation and company policies that would help women navigate through their careers, schooling, and every day life without being treated unfairly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned. –Bryan Stevenson</em>

“This book is important. But it is a candle in a hurricane.” This is a statement from one of the participants in the prison reading group I lead each month. In the fall of 2019, I was thinking of designing a research project regarding literacy efforts in jails and prisons. I stumbled across an article by Lisa D’Onofrio about how she ran a prison book club. My university is close to a maximum-security prison in Florida so I began working with the Santa Rosa Correctional Institution to create a prison reading group with ten male inmates. The goals of the group included increasing literacy for the inmates, keeping them in touch with current affairs by reading non-fiction books, and engaging them as they prepare to re-enter the community.

The group was designed to begin in January 2020 and run for six months. The participants would get one non-fiction book per month and we would meet on the last Friday for two hours to discuss the book at the prison chapel. The participants completed an initial anonymous questionnaire and will complete another anonymous survey at the end of the pilot study. The participants were also provided a composition book and pens to use throughout the study. Anyone interested in the group could sign up through the prison library.

In January, we were discussing our first month’s choice, “Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption” by Bryan Stevenson.  Because of the message of Just Mercy, it was a great book to begin facilitating a discussion about incarceration. The majority of the group enjoyed the book but also found it somewhat depressing because it reminded them of what they personally faced in the criminal justice system. They did appreciate that the book shines a light on what happens within the barbed wire of a jail or prison. But they felt it was like a candle in a hurricane—a flicker of light in a world pointing people in other directions. They expressed they often feel forgotten. It was a fascinating conversation. Some of the participants spoke more than others, but everyone said something about the book. When asked to define mercy, one participant said it is being there when someone needs you the most.  Another participant began discussing the “veneer of toughness” required of those incarcerated. We talked about the dangers of showing vulnerability and the importance of reading to stay connected.

At the end of the first meeting, the participants were given February’s book, “The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit” by Michael Finkel. This book details a man who left his life behind and lived in the Maine forest for decades before his arrest and returns to society.  The group met at the end of February and we spent a lot of time talking about the ideas of solitary confinement in the institutional setting vs. the solitary life of the book’s subject. They spoke about the challenges of having to rely on a criminal justice system that seemed stacked against defendants. They wondered how the system could be trusted when prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges work together every day. They were concerned that case outcomes could be sacrificed in order for those individuals to have functional working relationships within the courtroom. Their opinions about justice were quite interesting. In the book, the man steals from cabins in order to stay off the grid in Maine. The participants overwhelmingly agreed the subject should have been punished to the fullest extent of the law. We had a discussion about choices, self-sufficiency, and restitution. The participants questioned how the subject of the book could be exonerated when he made the choice to commit the criminal offense. We discussed whether the purpose of prison is to be a warehouse or to be a place of rehabilitation. The participants were given their book for March at the end of the meeting, Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime.”  The participants were also given a voluntary creative writing exercise designed by George Ella Lyon, a Kentucky author. Her poetry exercise is titled “Where I’m From” and comes with templates readers can use to write their own version. The format of the poem is to use imagery to let the reader know about the author’s history and from where they were raised.

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the remaining meetings were canceled until further notice. I was able to deliver the books for the April meeting, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II” by Liza Mundy.  Along with the book, a mail-in questionnaire about thoughts on “Born a Crime” was brought to the prison for distribution. I have received responses about “Born a Crime” in the mail. One of the participants said, “anyone who can laugh at himself and always find the humor in anything usually has all his marbles even if some of them rattle around a bit.” I appreciated the candor of this statement and agreed that Trevor Noah is a great example of someone who can find humor in the struggle. I have also received some wonderful poems.

The participants in the groups have expressed how much they enjoy meeting each month and discussing the books. They say the group also helps them interact with others they might not otherwise know within the institution. They are hoping the group continues past the original six-month pilot study. I thoroughly enjoy the monthly meetings as well. The conversations we have had are engaging and informative. I am glad we have been able to develop a workaround to still discuss our books during this time of quarantine. May’s book will be “The Other Wes Moore” by Wes Moore. June’s book will be “Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth” by Sarah Smarsh. This has been an extraordinary project and I hope to be able to bring some added light to those who are incarcerated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world with unprecedented consequences. People all around the globe are suffering, and yet at the same time are battling against it with equanimity. All professions are playing the role of a servitor to help the world escape this perilous situation. Lawyers have among all occupations (with the exception of the doctors and the police officers) endeavored to protect and indemnify their clients against the humongous losses suffered by them in this conundrum. To do so, some attorneys decided to “sue China” for the damages even though such action may provide no meaningful recovery.

In the United States, five law suits have been instituted against the People’s Republic of China. The suits have been filed in federal district courts in Florida, Texas, Nevada, California, and Missouri over the last six weeks. Out of these five class-action suits, the one filed in the State of Missouri received extensive admiration from various quarters including the President and the National Security Advisor of the United States. This suit is well-drafted and has additional grounds for satisfying the maintainability of the suit. Each of the five suits has pleaded the same ground for the maintainability of the suit, but such a suit is not maintainable by virtue of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The suit filed by the State of Missouri will be reviewed as the main case here because it is more comprehensive in nature and has embodied all the grounds vital in the other four suits. This particular case also specifies some separate grounds to avoid the applicability of FSIA.

<strong>FSIA AND THE ISSUE RELATED TO THE MAINTAINABILITY:</strong>

This <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1604">Act</a> provides for immunity to a foreign state (including its agency and instrumentality) from the jurisdiction of the Courts in the United States. The act, adopted in 1976, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/488/428/">forms</a> the "sole basis" for adjudicating disputes relating to a foreign state, and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/461/480/">provides</a> for "a comprehensive set of legal standards governing the claim of immunity." Nevertheless, this immunity is not absolute. There are some <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">exceptions</a> to it, and the presumption of immunity to a foreign state can be rebutted if the complainant satisfies the Court that the case will attract any one of these exceptions.

In each of these five suits against China, the court trying the case is <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1608">bound</a> to determine the following two issues at the outset:
<ol>
 	<li>Whether the opposite party comes under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1603">definition</a> of a foreign state? and;</li>
 	<li>If yes, whether any of the exceptions to immunity apply to the facts of the case?</li>
</ol>
<strong>Do the defendants qualify as a "Foreign State"?</strong>

Section 1603 of the “Jurisdictional <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Immunities</a> of Foreign State” provision in the US Code <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1603">defines</a> the term "foreign state" to include the political subdivision, the agency and the instrumentality of the foreign state.

The defendants are almost the same in all the five suits against China, and in each of these suits the plaintiffs are solely relying on the grounds of exceptions, indicating that the defendants qualify under the statutory definition of a "foreign state." However, the State of Missouri (among other common defendants) has impleaded the Communist Party of China (CPC) as a defendant, and through this attempts to escape the limitations of FSIA. It states that the CCP has a prominent status in China and that it “exercised direction and control” over all the other defendants mentioned in the complaints. To substantiate their argument, they have relied on an unreported Michigan Federal District Court <a href="https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2019/prc-complaint.pdf?sfvrsn=86ae7ab_2">opinion</a>, which held that the CCP is not entitled to immunity under the FSIA.

This opinion differs from the views of other courts. The opinion of a US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the <u>China Central Televisions</u> (<a href="https://casetext.com/case/chen-v-china-central-television">CCT</a>) case upheld on appeal that CCT was an instrumentality of China as it was the "mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party." Even a Federal District Court in Florida in the <a href="https://casetext.com/case/saludes-v-republica-de-cuba">Saludes</a> case held that the communist party of Cuba fell under FSIA, as it was similarly an instrumentality of Cuba. Further, to deal with the confusion relating to the “agency or instrumentality” requirement, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/560/305/">stated</a> that FSIA will be applicable and the immunity shall be given in cases where the foreign state is a “real party in interest” or is “an indispensable <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/553/851/">party</a>."

In light of the above statutory law and the observations of different courts, it can be concluded that in all the five cases the People’s Republic of China is the real party in interest and should come under the statutory definition of a "foreign state," thereby being immune from the jurisdiction of the Courts, subject to the applicability of the exceptions discussed below.

<strong>Do the Plaintiffs satisfy any exceptions to immunity?</strong>

In the five suits instituted by different States, they have relied on three exceptions to immunity: the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">exception</a> for commercial activities, the exception for territorial torts, and the exception for JASTA (Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Acts). The alleged acts in each complaint can be summarized by the opening passage in the complaint filed by the state of Missouri, which states:
<blockquote>During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.</blockquote>
<strong>Exceptions for Commercial Activities:</strong>

To satisfy an exemption related to commercial activity, any one of these conditions must be fulfilled: an act carried out in the US, or an act performed in the US, or an act carried out somewhere else but has a "direct effect" in the US. In the present cases, none of these conditions are fulfilled. The act is neither carried out, performed, nor has any direct effect in the US. The Supreme Court has interpreted the term “direct effect” to <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20151201f79">mean</a> "an immediate consequence" of the defendant's activity. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="https://casetext.com/case/intercontinental-indus-corp-v-wuhan-state-owned-indus-holdings-co">added</a> that a "direct effect" must not be an activity that is "too remote and attenuated."

If someone has to be blamed in the US, it should be its executive branch for their contributory negligence to curb the fatal virus. The government's negligence and its slow response has directly affected these respective states with an unforeseeable crisis.

<strong>Exceptions for Territorial Torts:</strong>

All five suits further relied on the exception of territorial torts, to exclude the defendants from the scope of FSIA. This exemption gives the right to the complainant to seek money damages for tortious acts or omissions from a foreign state for personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of property.

But it <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">excludes</a> the claim “based upon an exercise of or failure to exercise a discretionary function,” as well as claims for misrepresentation or deceit. In view of the above, though the complaint recites all the statutory provisions relating to the exceptions, it does not satisfy the requirements of any of them.

<strong>Exceptions for JASTA:</strong>

The JASTA was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ222/PLAW-114publ222.pdf">enacted</a> shortly after the fifteenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the US. It expands the jurisdiction of US Courts over the foreign state in cases where the foreign state's activity has resulted in any kind of personal injury to any person or property or caused any death in the US. The activity can either be a result of an act of international terrorism or could be a tortious act of a foreign state. But it <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">rejects</a> the jurisdiction of the US Courts in cases where the alleged activity is a result of mere negligence. In the absence of any scientific evidence to prove the theory of a bioweapon and of any pleading to rebut the exemption of mere negligence, the mere reciting of the statutory provision will not give any remedy to the complainants.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

It can be concluded that the filing of such suits in the US amidst the current global disorder will not provide anything beneficial, except for the media attention. If they are desirous of anything fruitful then they should endeavor to investigate the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the reasons for its outbreak in China. If they are successful in gathering evidence against the People’s Republic of China, then they may seek greater substantial remedies like international remedies, where China is also a party. For example, they could bring a claim for a crime against humanity under <a href="https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/225a2c/pdf/">Article 7</a> in the International Criminal Court, or under <a href="https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cpdpsbbtwd/cpdpsbbtwd.html">Article 7</a> to the United Nations Office of Disarmament Affairs under the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, or a claim under the <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/280">Protocol</a> for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare to the International Committee of Red Cross, Geneva, or a claim <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_510.pdf">under</a> international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law (prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities) to the International Law Commission.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“It is my aspiration that health finally will be seen not as a blessing to be wished for, but as a human right to be fought for.”</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">-United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan</p>
<span>Human rights are defined as those rights which are inherently possessed by a human being. The principal contemporary articulation of human rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716289506001002">claims</a> and prescribes universality for these rights. </span>The majority of state Constitutions have provisions for some kind of enforceable right to health and medical care. However, the constitutional definition of health protection varies widely between nations.

Can the right to health be universal considering the divergence of communal practices, societal setup, and economic differences around the globe? <span>In this paper, we present a r</span>elative affirmation of the universality of the right to health with the support of a COVID-19 study<em>.</em> COVID-19 has <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1">been</a> declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) but, its effect varies substantially across different nations. To fight the outbreak of COVID-19, the WHO offered a human rights approach. The right to health is universal to the extent of its acknowledgment as a human right, but is reduced to relativity when it comes to the means to achieve it. It is often put in the relativity of inequalities which are a result of the globalized neoliberal economic system. Moreover, the economic development of different countries, availability of resources with the state, and lastly, race and ethnicity bring subjectivity into the realm of the human right to health.

<strong><span>Universality Of Human Right To Health</span></strong>

<span>The universal characteristic of human rights is the fact that they are held universally by all human beings. Conceptually human rights are <a href="https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/workingpapers/2006/33-donnelly-2006-rev.pdf">equal</a> and inalienable. In contemporary times, the universality of human rights is granted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides universal protection to human rights and is accepted by most nations. Human Rights envisaged in international covenants and conventions have become part of customary international law. Human rights being interdependent, indivisible, and interrelated means that a violation of the right to health impedes the enjoyment of other human rights such as the right to education, life, and food. The universal interpretation of the right to health is not only inclusive of timely healthcare but it also encompasses all determinants of health.</span>

The first articulation of the right to health as a human right was made by the WHO in 1946. <span>The WHO Constitution states, “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.” According to <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23970&amp;LangID=E">Article 25</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), e</span>veryone is entitled to a standard of living. It provides for the health and well-being of each person and of their family. This is also enshrined in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx">Article 12</a> of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

The acknowledgment of health as a human right by the WHO invites two probable implications: first, the present society aims to achieve an acceptable standard of health by improving health and ensuring equity. Second, this <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1413-81232017002702151&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=en">involves</a> costs and includes various issues pertaining to injustice and inequity faced by millions of people in a neoliberal framework. The WHO’s response to COVID-19 presents the universal nature of the human right to health as it <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">urged</a> countries to take urgent and aggressive action by announcing the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic.

The normative formation of health as a human right has imperative implications on healthcare policies around the globe. Steps have been taken by the WHO to confirm and promote its established <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5236078/">principles</a> for the enforcement of the universal right to healthcare. These principles are: equal opportunity, solidarity, and evidence-based practice. The principle of equal opportunity aims to provide access to reasonable healthcare by conquering the impediment posed by limited resources. The solidarity principle represents unity amongst people. Lastly, evidence-based practice ensures collaborated global research. Several technical guidelines have been issued for the assistance of countries to prepare the framework to combat COVID-19. Such technical guidelines worked as guiding principles for nations around the globe to frame their set of rules and regulations at the time of the health emergency. WHO country offices have been working in close contact with the state governments to scrutinize their preparedness and response measures for COVID-19. Thus, the steps taken by this international organization stand in solidarity with every nation and extend support to protect the human right to health of every individual on the planet.

<span>Further, the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak">advice</a> on the use of masks and <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331496/WHO-2019-nCov-HCW_risk_assessment-2020.2-eng.pdf">management</a> of healthcare workers has been positively recognized by these countries. However, the level of adoption and implementation of the universal guidelines vary from nation to nation based on their legislative, judicial, and executive actions. Thus, the universal character of human rights by way of political or legal frameworks do not guarantee universal observance of human rights.</span>

<strong><span>Relatively Universal</span></strong>

<span>It is established that human rights are universal as they are possessed by all individuals. However, not all human beings enjoy these rights invariably. These norms and principles are propounded internationally, but the duty of enforcement lies in the sovereign states. Human rights are “<a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/ethics/pdfs/internationaljustice/biij/BIIJ2013/hoffmann.pdf">universal</a> in abstraction but national in application”. </span>The differences in the economic, social, and cultural construction of developing and developed nations render the imposition of ubiquitous human rights insignificant. For instance, the right to health in the US will be different than the right to health in India.

The relativity of the human right to health can be studied with the aid of current healthcare challenges imposed by COVID-19. The availability of resources determines the health condition of the very nation. Consequently, everyone cannot be entitled to every health service, nor is everyone <a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/fundamental-human-right/en/">entitled</a> to the same health status. Furthermore, the demographic characteristics of different countries strengthen the comparative concept of the right to health. The novel virus is more lethal for people sixty-five and older and for people with chronic health conditions. Approximately twenty-three percent of Italy’s population is 65 years or older, as a result, Italy has a higher Case Fatality Rate (CFR) than many other countries. India has <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-india-health-ministry-pc-deaths-comorbidities-percentage-total-cases-1668391-2020-04-18">recorded</a> over seventy-five percent of its deaths in people sixty and older and eighty percent of those had co-morbidities. Thus, the overall age distribution and the prevalent health conditions in a nation explain their death rates.

Moreover, the health conditions of a country can be examined by a nation’s economic power and its ability to provide health care services. That being so there cannot be a uniform standard of health. The state is further under an obligation to provide equable health services to all its citizens by bridging the income gap. Thus, it is difficult to accommodate the standard of healthcare in a country as the basic healthcare requirement may differ between economic classes. India’s public health expenditure has <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-lockdown-covid-19-pandemic-public-healthcare-system-doctors-nurses-patients/story/400039.html">been</a> less than two percent of the GDP. This renders the proper implementation of health care rights drafted at the global level quite difficult and irrational.

The relative impact of COVID-19 is <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/">reflected</a> in varying death rates around the globe. In Italy, the epicenter of the pandemic, the CFR is almost fourteen percent. Meanwhile, Belgium has the highest CFR at over fifteen percent while Singapore records the least at about a tenth of a percent. All the nations around the globe are disproportionately affected by the pandemic but its actual impact varies. The contrast arises because some states lack access to adequate medical care and have weak public health infrastructures. Social factors, such as housing conditions and population density, and host factors, such as nutritional status and co-existing medical conditions, impose a challenge for the universal enforcement of the right to health amid the pandemic.

<strong><span>Conclusion</span></strong>

Professor Amartya Sen says that the existence of universal rights <a href="https://dutraeconomicus.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/amartya-sen-the-idea-of-justice-2009.pdfhttps:/dutraeconomicus.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/amartya-sen-the-idea-of-justice-2009.pdf">forms</a> part of a global idea of justice. Nevertheless, the notion of justice holds a different meaning for different states even though the recognition of the need to achieve justice is ubiquitous throughout the world and not <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-013-1814-z">bound</a> by a particular culture. Human rights reflect a common morality. <span>Normative principles of the right to health cannot be made universally applicable because of the reasons stated above. </span>

<span>Besides, the right to health may be availed by one having legal nationality. Lack of proper national identity is the biggest hurdle to claim the right to medication. There is a need for formal political recognition by the state to ensure proper implementation of health rights to all. Race and ethnicity also contribute to the ingression of the right to health. </span>

Policy measures to combat the pandemic crisis also differ in every nation. To overcome this pandemic, Japan, first banned entry to visitors from certain areas of China and South Korea, then extended this to 21 European countries and Iran. Australia and New Zealand have also banned entry to all foreigners while India canceled visas for foreigners. The United Kingdom has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51737226">joined</a> other countries in severely limiting the movement of the public.

Thus,<span> there is </span>universal possession of the right to health but no universal enforcement. <span>A state, therefore, cannot recognize any international imposition without considering its internal societal sphere. No effective implementation can be possible without removing the inherent defects of society. The health of the society, especially those who need it most, is being compromised due to the redundant obligation that the states have towards the international norms. Therefore, t</span>he challenge today is the indigenization of human rights and their enforcement within each country’s legal and cultural framework.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Indian Constitution is not merely a static document containing a set of rules or laws through which the state governs its people, it is much more. The constitution is a dynamic phenomenon, ever-evolving in its contours, which was born with a task of protecting individuals who have been subordinated by the society in innumerable ways, be it by patriarchy, communalism or classism.

However, the Constitution fails in its objective miserably by closing off personal laws from Judicial Scrutiny. Personal laws govern matters of family affairs and have been a major <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/triple-talaq-supreme-court-976439-2017-05-11">hindrance</a> when it comes to empowerment and upholding the dignity of women in India. The deepened <a href="http://sajms.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9-Article-on-Personal-Law-in-India.pdf">inequality</a> and discrimination not only lies within religion but also between genders.

<strong>Why Are Personal Laws Not Subject to Judicial Scrutiny?</strong>

This is the result of the Bombay High Court’s <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/54613/">decision</a> in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Narasu Appa Mali</span>, which was a turning point in constitutional history. The Court interpreted the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134715/">inclusion</a> of “law” under Article 13(3), and “laws in force” under Article 13(1), to exclude personal laws, which, in turn, made personal laws immune from judicial review. Article 13 renders all laws inconsistent and derogative of fundamental rights as void.

Hence, if these Personal laws are allowed to be followed without judicial scrutiny, then there will not only be sexual inequality between men and women of one community, but also inequality between women of different religious communities. Furthermore, not subjecting personal laws to judicial scrutiny will make the fundamental rights of people, especially women, more vulnerable to exploitation. Article 13 supports the violation of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/367586/">Article 14</a>, concerned with the “Right to Equality for all” and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">Article 21</a>, regarding the “Right to Life” of the people of India, by inherently subjecting them to social morality.

The issue of religious personal law was frequently debated at various <a href="http://loksabhaph.nic.in/writereaddata/cadebatefiles/C21011947.pdf">stages</a> in the enactment of the fundamental rights and directive principles by the constituent assembly of India. It was decided that, rather than articulating whether these personal laws had to conform to the constitutional guarantees or any social reform legislation, the Uniform Civil Code under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1406604/">Article 44</a> was a non-justiciable directive principle of state policy and left the question for future deliberations. However, recently the Law Commission of India <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/uniform-civil-code-is-not-possible-its-not-even-an-option-law-commission-chairman-1595623.html">reaffirmed</a> that currently, a Uniform Civil Code is not feasible in India. So, the question remains, are there any other options? Or should women face the wrath of the misogynistic and patriarchal personal laws of India?

<strong>“Law” Under Article 13</strong>

As per Article 13(3), “law” includes “customs and usages having the force of law”. Justice Chandrachud, while refuting <u>Narasu</u> in the <a href="https://www.sci.gov.in/pdf/JUD_6.pdf">Sabrimala</a> judgment, said that the definition of “law” under Article 13(3) is an inclusive definition and it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation. Going by the scriptural texts, he decided on the inclusion of personal laws in “customs and usages” under Article 13, and how they have been creating a menace by not being subjected to judicial review for years. This obiter dictum by Justice Chandrachud reduced the relevance of the discussion on personal laws in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Triple Talaq</span> <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/115701246/">judgment</a>, which said that personal laws are not included in Article 13.

Now, after knowing that personal laws can be included in “customs and usages," we must check whether personal laws have the “force of law." According to Salmond, the law is the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice. Therefore, any rule of conduct, although not statutory, still has the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1155563/">force</a> of law so long as it is enforced by the court.

Moreover, the power of the courts to apply Hindu law to Hindu people is derived from and regulated by, imperial and provincial legislations passed during the British rule. Unless they are altered or repealed, those laws continue to be in force under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/74529/">Article 372</a> of the Indian Constitution. The same test can automatically apply to personal law as well.

The apex court in <u>Kripal Bhagat v. State of Bihar</u> <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/56785029/">observed</a> that the power to apply the law is to bring into legal effect sections of an act as if the same had been enacted in its entirety. Furthermore, in the <a href="https://www.casemine.com/judgement/in/58117e212713e1794785fc8c">case</a> <u>In re Kahandas Narrandas,</u> it was observed that the specification of matters related to succession and contract as matters to be governed by native laws and usages might be construed as an indication of a wider operation of those laws and usages intended to be secured by the statute. In this regard, it may be construed that a Statute gives the power of enforcement to personal laws and brings them into legal effect. In fact, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1188494/">Section 2</a> of the Shariat Act directs that in all questions regarding marriage, succession and the like, law to be governed will be the Muslim personal law, thereby giving personal law a legal effect and fulfilling the criteria laid down by Article 13 of the Constitution.

Article 372 may be useful in this regard. For instance, in <span style="text-decoration: underline">United Provinces v. Atiqua Begum</span>, it was <a href="http://14.139.60.114:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/508/1/The%20United%20Provinces%20v.%20Mst.%20Atiqa%20Begum%20and%20others.pdf">observed</a> that the expression “law in force” in <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1935/2/pdfs/ukpga_19350002_en.pdf">Section 292</a> of the Government of India Act, applies not only to statutory enactments then in force, but to personal laws, customary laws, and common laws. By virtue of Article 372(1), the Constituent Assembly was in effect re-enacting the provisions of personal laws again appear in <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S7.pdf">Entry 5</a> of List III of the Constitution of India and making it clear that the state can enact legislation in relation to personal laws and there is no reason why personal law cannot be subjected to judicial scrutiny under Part III of the Constitution of India.

<strong>The Goal and the Failure</strong>

C.J. Kania, in <span style="text-decoration: underline">A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</span>, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/">reasoned</a> that Article 13’s use of the word “law” so often was the use of “abundant caution” when drafting and enunciated that even in its absence Courts can strike down unconstitutional enactments. Hence, Article 13 was added to be extra cautious and ensure fundamental rights review, considering its supreme importance.

It is pertinent to note that Article 13 is not only a barrier when it comes to equal treatment of women but is superfluous as well. This falls in line with the celebrated <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/5/137/">decision</a> of the US Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Marbury v. Madison</span>, which propounded:
<blockquote>With the establishment of a new political character, institution and constitution, all pre-existing laws inconsistent therewith at once stand displaced and cease to be of any obligatory force without any declaration to that effect.</blockquote>
This, in turn, makes Article 13(1) useless and redundant because it refers to pre-constitution laws. If personal laws would have been regarded as laws as enunciated above, Article 13 would not have been necessary in the Indian Constitution. Rather than protecting fundamental rights, Article 13 is becoming a barrier for women in attaining fundamental rights.

On the other hand, Articles <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/369702/">245(1)</a> and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/631708/">25</a> make law made by the Indian Parliament subject to the Constitution itself. Thus, post-constitutional laws would backslide regardless of the presence of Article 13(2). Saying that it becomes quite clear that judicial review strings out the entire length and breadth of the Indian Constitution and the void of Article 13 cannot hold back the Courts to nullify a detracting law, but the issue now rests on the inclusion of  “law” in Article 13.

<strong>Historical School of Jurisprudence</strong>

Furthermore, Article 13 brings into effect the Historical school of Jurisprudence, ultimately leaving human rights to the whims and fancies of people’s consciousness. In <u>Ahmedabad Women Action Group v. Union of India</u><em>, </em>the Court <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1743680/">stated</a>:
<blockquote>Personal laws should be excluded from the ambit of judicial review and it is not for a court to make a choice of something which it considers forward-looking. Personal Laws and religion are for <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/115701246/">interpretation</a> as it is and must be accepted in faith of the followers.</blockquote>
This view of the Chief Justice has been <a href="https://www.constitutionofindia.net/constitution_assembly_debates/volume/7/1948-11-23">backed</a> in the constitutional assembly debates, wherein it was deliberated that there would be amendments in personal laws when the members of that particular religion would require. However, struggle and inequality continue and await the consciousness of people to change.

In this regard, it is worth noting that Article 13 brings into effect legal pluralism and creates a distinction between state and non-state law, thus relying highly on black-letter law. Even Indian jurists like H.M. Seervai are of the view that personal laws are inextricably connected to the entire network of law. Therefore, it would be difficult to ascertain the residual effects of personal law outside them. But it is crucial to understand that Article 13 clearly contradicts this and creates a distinction between state law and non-state law, thereby giving much less importance to the latter, which is eventually left out of the “real” law of the state.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

In the end, we come to the conclusion that Article 13 is not essential to the Indian Constitution as it poses a lot of problems and fails in its objective. It also undermines the importance and relevance of Article 372 in solving the problem and making the Indian Constitution live up to its objective of equality and dignity for women, especially for Muslim women, in India.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interpreting the word games at play in workplace safety guidelines, President Trump's recent executive order on the food supply chain, and company motives is something like unpacking a Russian doll. The name of these Russian nesting dolls is Matryoshka or Babushka. Babushka means grandmother or old woman. This name is ironic because a lot of workers in these food plants are women. Often, these elaborately crafted dolls follow a theme, including Russian leaders. Maybe, in this case, one could make them American leaders of states that do not respect workers (hat tip to Assistant Professor <a href="https://faculty.utulsa.edu/faculty/warigia-bowman/">Warigia Bowman</a> of the University of Tulsa College of Law for the observation).

Let's explore.
<h4>I. The Big Doll</h4>
On April 28, 2020, as part of declaring meat supply "critical" and with the aim of reopening plants, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-delegating-authority-dpa-respect-food-supply-chain-resources-national-emergency-caused-outbreak-covid-19/">issued</a> the Executive Order on Delegating Authority Under the DPA [Defense Production Act] with Respect to Food Supply Chain Resources During the National Emergency Caused by the Outbreak of COVID-19.

Among the reasons given in the Executive Order for the action were (1) the outbreaks of COVID-19 among workers at some processing facilities that have led to the reduction of some facilities' production capacity and (2) recent actions in some states that have led to the complete closure of some large processing facilities.

In response to these developments, the executive order states that:
<blockquote>Such actions may differ from or be inconsistent with interim guidance recently issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor entitled “Meat and Poultry Processing Workers and Employers” providing for the safe operation of such facilities.</blockquote>
<h4>II. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
Now if one turns to the CDC and OSHA <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/meat-poultry-processing-workers-employers.html">guidance</a> that has been provided to meat-packing plants, one sees a series of what can only be termed mealy-mouthed phrases on worker safety, to wit:
<blockquote>Configure communal work environments so that workers are spaced at least six feet apart, <strong>if possible</strong>.

Modify the alignment of workstations, including along processing lines, <strong>if feasible</strong>, so that workers are at least six feet apart in all directions (e.g., side-to-side and when facing one another), when possible. <strong>Ideally</strong>, modify the alignment of workstations so that workers do not face one another. <strong>Consider</strong> using markings and signs to remind workers to maintain their location at their station away from each other and practice social distancing on breaks.

Use physical barriers, such as strip curtains, plexiglass or similar materials, or other impermeable dividers or partitions, to separate meat and poultry processing workers from each other, <strong>if feasible</strong>.

Facilities should <strong>consider</strong> consulting with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning engineer to ensure adequate ventilation in work areas to help minimize workers’ potential exposures.

If fans such as pedestal fans or hard mounted fans are used in the facility, take steps to minimize air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another worker. Personal cooling fans should be removed from the workplace to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses. If fans are removed, employers should remain aware of, and take steps to prevent, heat hazards.

Place handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations to encourage hand hygiene. <strong>If possible</strong>, choose hand sanitizer stations that are touch-free. See OSHA’s Sanitation Standard (29 CFR 1910.141), which requires employers to provide handwashing facilities for workers [emphasis added].</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Reading the executive order and the CDC/OSHA guidance together, one sees that the order is concerned with differences or inconsistencies between what is happening at the meat-packing plants and the guidance. This would seem to be a valid  point. However, the guidance has so much precautionary language that it leaves a significant amount of discretion to the management of the meat-packing facility as to how it will protect the workers. This problem was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow/watch/under-trump-formerly-stalwart-cdc-goes-soft-on-meat-plants-82725957840">discussed</a> at length on the Rachel Maddow Show on April 28, 2020.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">And, so workers get sick and workers die if they go back to work.</span>
<h4>III. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
A company that reopens or increases production may say to laid-off workers that it is seeking volunteers to come back. That way, the worker who “volunteers” is in some sense assuming a risk in going back to the workplace, thus providing a defense for the company if anything happens to them on the worksite.

With respect to volunteering, the unemployed worker is faced with the Hobbesian choice between protecting their health or going back to an unhealthy workplace where a COVID-19 pandemic is rampant.
<h4>IV. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
If there is a job available and a worker does not take it, there are <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/meat-processing-workers-states-reopen-lose-unemployment-benefits-georgia-texas-iowa.html">reports</a> that some governors are saying that the unemployed worker will no longer be entitled to unemployment compensation and maybe even more.

Under the CARES act, these workers are almost certainly getting <strong>more</strong> in unemployment benefits than they would have in wages.

The CARES act created the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) program, which provides a fixed or flat amount of $600 to state-level unemployment benefits. Because the FPUC payment is a defined amount, the result is that workers with wages of about $55,000 a year or less will actually receive more in unemployment benefits than they would have in wages.

Each state's unemployment benefit level is different, some states have extremely low unemployment benefits. While the numbers change by state, the same issue applies everywhere.

A Texas example: an employee who earned about $30,000 a year, would have wages of roughly $600 a week. The standard unemployment benefit would have been roughly $300 a week. The FPUC adds a flat $600 a week on top, so the worker now gets unemployment benefits of $900 a week. The worker is substantially better off receiving unemployment benefits than working.

However, two factors limit this odd situation.

The FPUC benefit expires on July 31, 2020, so the impact of the program is relatively short-lived.

The Department of Labor issued guidance to the states earlier this week indicating that a laid off or furloughed employee who refuses to come back to work in order to keep drawing the higher unemployment benefits would be disqualified from receiving benefits <strong>at all </strong>(hat tip to <a href="https://www.ricelawyers.com/robert-c-rice/">Robert C. Rice</a> for this line of analysis).

So not only is the Hobbesian choice one about whether to protect one’s health (and under community spread those in your family and those with whom one has contact) or go to an unhealthy workplace but also, if one chooses to protect one’s health one loses money thus endangering one’s ability to feed oneself and one’s family.
<h4>V. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
And if by some happenstance the worker gets sick and/or dies, there may be arguments about whether the worker actually contracted COVID-19 at the workplace or out in the community as a way to deny liability for the worker’s sickness and/or death.

And because people with COVID-19 may die of underlying problems that are made more severe by COVID-19, even if COVID-19 can be proved to have been contracted at the plant, the question will be raised as to whether a given sickness or death is a “true” COVID-19 sickness or death.
<h4>VI. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
Moreover, with reopening being subject to the Defense Production Act, the plant could assert a form of governmental contractor qualified immunity (similar to the Agent Orange cases from the Vietnam era) or in the torture cases.
<h4>VII. The Next Smallest Doll</h4>
And if that is not good enough, there is an <a href="https://www.13abc.com/content/news/Companies-seek-to-limit-legal-liability-for-virus-infections-570013661.html">effort</a> by business groups to get Congress to pass legislation to limit liability for COVID-19 for reopening.
<h4>VIII. The Moving Pieces</h4>
This seven-level set of word games leads to worker endangerment <strong>NOT</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400">worker protection. And so the rules and structures to protect worker health and safety end up actually countenancing worker sickness and death.</span>
<h4>IX. We Have Seen This Before -- Will We Do Something This Time?</h4>
We have seen this kind of word gaming in the torture memos of nearly 20 years ago.

We have seen this kind of word gaming in the guidance for reopening <a href="/commentary/2020/04/davis-widen-covid-19-guidelines-as-crime/">discussed</a> in a prior JURIST guest academic commentary.

But, as any semanticist will tell you, the word is not the thing so we should not be duped by these word games.

The thing is that this unsophisticated mind gaming leads to worker sickness and death: one begins to see evidence of the kind of <em>mens rea</em> and <em>actus reus</em> of an international crime: a crime against humanity.

Looking at the definition of crimes against humanity in the Statute of the International Criminal Court one would note that the definition under Article 7(1) states:
<blockquote>1. For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a <strong>widespread or systematic attack</strong> directed against <strong>any</strong> <strong>civilian population</strong>, with knowledge of the attack:

(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender as defined in paragraph 3, <strong>or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law</strong>, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;

(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character <strong>intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health</strong>.

2. For the purpose of paragraph 1:

(a) "Attack directed against any civilian population" means a course of conduct involving the <strong>multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack </strong>[emphasis added].</blockquote>
If the local or national worker protection laws as applied do not, in fact, protect workers but endanger them and if the courts turn a deaf ear to the pleas of these workers in harm’s way, we may be at a time when an international tribunal with appropriate jurisdiction as well as regional and international human rights bodies of the UN should weigh in on behalf of these workers. These workers who appear to be abandoned to the wolves of COVID-19 by their employers.

Local law possibilities can be promising as we can see from the recent <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_4utx4-AZsMne3s1Rt7gdC7M5PaOrNo5/edit">decision</a> in France of April 24, 2020, of the Court of Appeals of Versailles against a French Amazon subsidiary with respect to its warehouse workers. One union and then a group of unions brought complaints about the health and safety of the warehouses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dispositive judgement the Court of Appeals states:

The Court of Appeals confirmed the decision of the prior judge of urgent matters ordering Amazon to evaluate with the workers the workplace risks inherent to the COVID-19 pandemic in all of its warehouse facilities and ordering them to put in place measures to protect the health and safety of workers pursuant to the labor code. While awaiting the putting in place of those measures, in a de novo decision the Court of Appeals went on to order Amazon, within 48 hours of the notification of the decision, to limit the activity of its warehouses to only receiving merchandise, preparing and delivering of orders for a narrow, authorized subset of products in the Amazon catalog. The Court of Appeals went even further pronouncing that after this 48-hour period a fine of €100,000 will be due for each reception, preparation and or delivery of products that were not authorized, and this for a maximum period of one month after which the court might decide again on this matter. All costs were borne by Amazon.

However, if local law possibilities do not provide relief or only piecemeal relief in the context of a worldwide pandemic, if we care about workers we might need consider taking  a more international or transnational level to fully comprehend the possible human rights violations that may be leading to their sickness and death for profit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

December 2019 witnessed the outbreak of one of the deadliest viruses ever when China reported some cases of unusual pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus remained unknown for a brief period of time, but it spread rampantly across Europe and Asia in the months of January and February. Slowly it moved towards the United States, putting the whole world under lockdown. The epicenter of this virus was identified to be in Wuhan, China. WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern and named the virus COVID-19.

As of April 24, there have been around <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">2,800,000</a> (changing rapidly every subsequent hour) reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide. India witnessed its first case of COVID-19 on January 30. As of April 24, the figure for active cases in India is around <a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/">18,000</a>  and death toll is around 723. In order to curb the spread of this virus, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days on March 24. The lockdown was later extended until May 3 by the prime minister on April 14.

This piece is an attempt to analyze various challenges that are arising during this unprecedented lockdown and how the legal service authorities are ensuring provision of legal aid and basic amenities across India.

<strong>Legal Aid and NALSA</strong>

The European Court of Human Rights, under Sections 6(1) and 6(3), discusses the concept of legal aid without mentioning the term itself. They aim to protect the interest of every litigant and create an equal platform for each person who is in dire need of justice by assisting them. The United Nation’s International Convention on Civil and Political Rights provides for legal assistance in criminal matters.

The Constitution of India promotes and upholds the importance of equality in society. Various articles of the Constitution promote welfare of the poor and of those who are in need of justice and care. <a href="https://www.legalcrystal.com/act/37900/constitution-of-india-article-39a">Article 39A</a> of the Constitution provides for free legal aid to the poor and weaker sections of the society, and it ensures justice for all. The article mandates that economic, or any other, disability should not hinder the opportunity of anyone to access justice and legal remedies.

The National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) was created under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192292157/">Section 3</a> of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 (<a href="https://nalsa.gov.in/acts-rules/the-legal-services-authorities-act-1987">Act</a>). The objective of NALSA is to supervise and monitor the provision of legal aid as described under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/145247585/">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Act. Section 12 of the Act specifies the category of people who are eligible for availing these legal services. NALSA also disburses funds and grants to NGOs for implementing legal aid schemes and programs.

<strong>Impact of Lockdown and Necessary Legal Assistance</strong>

This pandemic and the resultant lockdown have caused the greatest deal of misery to the poor and underprivileged sections of society. From food to basic survival necessities, they took the worst hit out of all. NALSA, in this situation of grave urgency, responded to address the concerns of poor and weaker sections of society.

NALSA issued an order directing the State Legal Service Authorities (SLSA) to assist and provide legal aid to those in need of it. The importance of legal aid during events like these is paramount. In many countries, like South Africa and Kenya, legal aid and services are <a href="https://eagle.co.ug/2020/04/22/legal-services-are-essential-during-the-covid-19-lockdown.html">categorized</a> as "essential services," so that they can be provided to the people of the country seamlessly.

The United Nation High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25745&amp;LangID=E">suggested</a> that the outbreak of this virus in jails and prison can affect the situation very drastically. Experts have suggested that people in prison are kept in close contact with each other and usually with the jail staff as well. The outbreak of this virus in these places might impact the vulnerable population there negatively. It was suggested that states should consider releasing prisoners to decongest the prison and reduce the possibilities of coronavirus outbreak. Various countries across the globe have resorted to decongesting their prisons to counter further spread of virus. Morocco, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Afghanistan <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/at-least-200-000-prisoners-to-be-released-worldwide-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak-1.1001775">issued</a> orders to do so, and they allowed old or sick prisoners to leave. Prisoners who were convicted for low-risk crimes were also allowed to leave.

In India, the Supreme Court (SC), the apex court of the country, <a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2020/9761/9761_2020_1_8_21570_Order_23-Mar-2020.pdf">ordered</a> state governments to consider releasing some prisoners on parole to reduce overcrowding in prisons. The order of the SC by Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde read: "Each State/Union Territory shall constitute a High Powered Committee...to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or interim bail for such period as may be thought appropriate.” The High Powered Committee of each state issued guidelines, with the help of respective State Legal Service Authorities, on who can be allowed to leave prison on bail and on what categories of prisoners will stay in jail. The latter mostly consisted of prisoners on trial for offenses under the Protection of Children From Sexual Offenses (<a href="https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/POCSO%20Act%2C%202012.pdf">POCSO</a>) Act, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (<a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10483/1/the_narcotic_drugs_and_psychotropic_substances%2C_act%2C_1985.pdf">NDPS</a>) Act, and similar laws. The Government of Delhi and many other states decided to amend their prison rules and release prisoners under trial in order to decongest the prisons.
As of April 15, according to the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/11077-undertrials-freed-to-decongest-jails-following-covid-19-nalsa/article31350752.ece">statistics</a> provided by NALSA,11,077 prisoners under trial across 232 districts have been released from jail during the COVID-19 lockdown. Additionally, in some states, prisoners convicted for non-heinous offences are released on parole and furloughed to decongest the prisons. The count of such prisoners who have been released, as of April 15, is 5,981. NALSA is offering assistance to these prisoners through panel lawyers.

With the help of its workforce of panel lawyers and paralegal volunteers, as well as with the constant efforts of DLSA, NALSA is also trying to channel efforts to <a href="http://dslsa.org/2020/04/07/dslsa-distributed-food-grains-to-daily-wage-workers-at-goyla-dairy/">provide</a> people with food and to help poor migrant workers who are stranded without any place to go. Various helpline numbers have been issued that these people can contact to seek help.

Additionally, paralegal volunteers, with the help of local administrations, are undertaking the work of food and mask distribution to the remotest of the areas. Delhi State Legal Service Authority <a href="http://dslsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Measures-undertaken-by-DSLSA-to-amolerate-the-condition-of-persons-belonging-to-marginalized-sections-of-society.pdf">organized</a> camps for distribution of food packets, pulses, rice, and similar items to the poor people across its region.

One of the recurring issues throughout the initial phase of lockdown was the increase in domestic violence incidents. To address the issue, NALSA requested all SLSAs to coordinate with the <a href="https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/OSC_G.pdf">One Stop Centers</a> that were set up by the Ministry of Women and Child. The paralegals and volunteers will assist the victims with legal aid by filing cases, filing affidavits, and informing them about their rights.

Additionally, helpline number 181 was issued to provide women with assistance and legal aid. The DLSA of Chandigarh <a href="https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/legal-services-authorities-reach-out-to-the-needy-amid-covid-19-lockdown-96372">appointed</a> two lawyers, Manjit Kaur and Anchal Thakur, to provide legal aid and to support the One Stop Centre. Furthermore, they will provide assistance on the 181 helpline in Chandigarh. The SLSA of Chandigarh is also providing food and rations to the needy. The SLSA of Kashmir has requested the SLSA Chandigarh to provide food to its 15 migrant workers who are stuck in Chandigarh. Similarly, the SLSA of Mizoram requested SLSA Chandigarh to provide relief to 120 students from Mizoram who are stranded in Nayagaon.

These are just some of the initiatives taken by the government and the legal service authorities to ensure justice and assist people in sustaining human life. The actions illustrate the importance of legal aid and services to ensure equality and basis subsistence in poor and weaker sections of society.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The spread of coronavirus and this unprecedented lockdown have posed serious challenges to governments and organizations across the world. The supply of basic amenities includes food, water, clothing, and justice in this modern world. The active role of legal service authorities has ensured a flow of assistance from the state to the people. During this time of public health emergency, legal service authorities took active charge and have responded to address all concerns. In addition to facilitating legal aid to the poor and the weaker sections of the society, NALSA has, through its competent workforce, ensured that essentials like food, masks, and sanitizer reach all people. Various helpline numbers and distress numbers are helping people access aid, both essential and legal. Incidents of domestic violence are on rise, and it is ensured that victims have access to legal system with the help of Ministry of Women and Children. In a nutshell, NALSA, as the apex legal service authority in India, stood up to its task and has helped the government to ensure the safety and security of everyone across the geographical boundaries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

Amid the ongoing situation in India due to the spread of the SARS-CoV-19 virus, there have been a few instances where medical practitioners were attacked by an unruly mob. To counter extraordinary situations, extraordinary steps need to be taken, in furtherance of which the Uttar Pradesh Government and the Madhya Pradesh government have subsequently <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1758?view_type=browse&amp;sam_handle=123456789/1362">invoked</a> the draconian National Security Act,1980. Back in late 2019, this act was used frequently to curb the voice of <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anti-caa-protests-1113-arrests-5558-preventive-detentions-19-dead-in-up/article30402858.ece">dissent</a>, in protest against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill, with more than 5,538 preventive detentions alone in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

With these and many other recent cases, this 4-decade old piece of legislation has again come under the limelight. Enacted by Indira Gandhi’s government by an ordinance, it has been frequently exploited by the executive for detaining individuals, using the plea of preventing future disturbances of public order. This has resulted in state sanctioned violation of human rights. Although it is necessary to equip the state with this type of power to deal with extraordinary situations such as the one currently prevailing, giving blank cover to act on its subjective satisfaction is problematic.

To understand this piece of legislation in depth, it is necessary to understand its historical background in the pre- as well as the post-independent India. In this article we will also be explaining the nuances of this act as well as the various loopholes prevailing in the act and how it is being misused.

<strong>A Step Backward- A Brief History</strong>

It is imperative to know the historical background as well as the intent and the motive with which the legislation was first brought in place. Its history goes back to the colonial era. It was first created in the year 1818 and named Bengal Regulation III, with an intent to empower the British government to arrest anyone in the name of defense and public order without any trial. Next in line were the Rowlatt Acts of 1919 which <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gandhi2014/the-rowlatt-acts">brought</a> with them much hue and cry. These acts resulted in the Jalliawala Bagh massacre followed by the country wide protest as part of the non-cooperation movement.

Coming to post-colonial independent India, our freedom fighters who suffered the most from these acts, didn’t hesitate to give sanctity to the preventive detention laws, and <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Preventive_Detention_Act,_1950">enacted</a> the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. Right after coming into force, it was not used much to maintain public order, rather a political leader of A.K. Goplan’s eminence was <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198066286.001.0001/acprof-9780198066286-chapter-4">detained</a> under the aforesaid act. From its initial actions, it was evident that the act was used to curb political dissent, and that legacy has been and is being followed now. As the act was enacted only for a limited time period, it was set to expire on 31st December 1969. The then-prime minister Ms. Indira Gandhi brought the more contentious act, i.e. <a href="https://www.casemine.com/act/in/5a979dd84a93263ca60b74f7">MISA</a> (Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971), which gave indefinite powers to the government and law enforcement agencies. It became infamous during the emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi’s government. It was later repealed by the Janata Dal government, which came to power in 1977 after defeating the Indira Gandhi-led congress party. But Indira Gandhi came back to power in 1980 and came up with the National Security Act, 1980, which latter popularly came to be <a href="https://scroll.in/article/856631/uttar-pradesh-the-use-of-nsa-to-keep-the-bhim-armys-chandrashekhar-in-prison-is-draconian">known</a> as “no vakil, no appeal, no daleel” (no lawyer, no appeal, no argument).

<strong>Law and Its Loopholes</strong>

More often than not preventive detention laws are invoked for the sake of public order. But, in order to do so, there’s a small distinction which needs to be kept in mind. Every minute breach of law and order by a given situation cannot be termed as a threat to public order. This distinction was made by the apex court in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1733535/">case</a> of Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of Bihar, wherein the court stated that,
<blockquote>“One has to imagine three concentric circles. Law and order represent the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents security of State. It is then easy to see that an act may affect law and order, but not public order just as an act may affect public order but not security of the State.”</blockquote>
The government’s over-reliance on preventive detention in ordinary criminal cases appears to misconstrue two fundamental <a href="https://thewire.in/caste/national-security-act-obscuring-flaws-indias-criminal-justice-system">aspects</a>: (1) preventive detention is intended to stop future crimes; and (2) it is not meant to respond to ordinary law and order violations. In many of the cases reviewed, the detainee stood accused of a crime, and by obscuring the flaws in the Indian criminal justice system, they were detained under the NSA. For our better understanding of the law, it is beneficial to know the nuances of the act and how some of them are vaguely termed and are flawed and can lead to misrepresentation.

On disclosure of the grounds for detention: Section 8(1) explicitly states that the person detained should know of the grounds of his detention in not more than 5 days but not later than 10 days. But, section 8(2) states, “Nothing in sub-section (1) shall require the authority to disclose facts which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose.”

The Constitution of the advisory board: Section 9(1) of the said act states that, “The Central Government and each State Government shall, whenever necessary, constitute one or more Advisory Boards for the purposes of this Act.”

Whereas, Section 9(2) talks of the constituents of the advisory board, which states that, “Every such Board shall consist of three persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court, and such persons shall be appointed by the appropriate Government.”

The advisory board has come under criticism as it is constituted by the government to adjudge upon the order passed by it only. It's like an executive review on the decision of the executive where the executive can also appoint members who would be willing to work hand-in-hand with the government giving it the unprecedented power to act upon its will.

Another aspect of the law which may jeopardize the review power of the advisory board is that the proceeding and the final report of the board is kept in-camera and is hence not available for public scrutiny under section 11(4). Further, Section 11(4) also states that, “Nothing in this section shall entitle any person against whom a detention order has been made to appear by any legal practitioner in any matter connected with the reference to the Advisory Board.” The detainee, which may be a person not well-educated and has no idea of his legal rights, is not allowed to be represented by any legal practitioner whereas the detaining authority is allowed to be represented by counsel. This further reduces his chance of being set free after making a successful representation in front of the advisory board which can be summarized as quoted by the apex court, “The dice was loaded against the detainee in that whereas he had to go without legal assistance, the State Government had the benefit of an array of lawyers.”

Section 13 defines the maximum period of the detention which may extend up to 12 months. It further empowers the government to revoke or modify the detention. Section 14(2) explicitly states that a fresh order can be brought about irrespective of the revocation of the expiry of the previous order. It can lead to a longer detention if the government sought the same. Even if an individual is detained because of clearly invalid reasons, he will not be released so long as the government authorities manage to put in one of the grounds for detention in the detention order. Hence, it shows the arbitrary nature of the law. Arbitrariness is the very antithesis of Article 14. The principle of reasonableness is an essential element of equality and the procedure contemplated by Article 21 must answer the test of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article 14.

<strong>Loopholes and Their Repercussions</strong>
<blockquote>"Secret violence is confined to isolated and very small parts of India and to a microscopic body of the people. But the passing of the Bills designed to affect the whole of India and its people and arming the government with power out of all proportion to the situation sought to be dealt with, is a greater danger."</blockquote>
Mahatma Gandhi wrote this in a <a href="http://d1.manupatra.com.elibrary.rmlnlu.ac.in:2048/ShowPDF.asp?flname=Alternate_Report_and_Commentaryalternatereportandcommentarytotheu.n.humanCOM776693.pdf">letter</a> to the press expressing his dissatisfaction towards the Rowlatt Acts of 1919. Preventive detentions can only be tolerated in any democratic society in the most extreme circumstances. It must be used with utmost restraint and retained as long as it is strictly <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/44027383">necessary</a>. Yet, in a democratic society like India, it has been invoked recklessly on the sole discretion of the government and the law enforcement agencies.

Hence, to understand this dilemma, it’s necessary to look upon a few recent cases from the plethora of cases wherein the NSA was invoked and what the rationale was behind doing so. (disclaimer: some of the quoted facts and figures might be a bit inaccurate as the NCRB [National Crime Record Bureau] as the name suggests, maintains the repository of the crimes and the criminals and does not take into account the FIR’s registered under NSA. Hence, there is no exact figure for the same. But according to a rough figure, NSA was being misused or abused by the executive authorities in <a href="https://www.india-seminar.com/2002/512/512 seminarist.htm">72.5%</a> of all cases.)

DR. Kafeel Khan was <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/politics/article30912135.ece">detained</a> under the NSA by the Uttar Pradesh government after he gave an anti-CAA speech in Aligarh Muslim University and was also charged with section 153A and 295A of the IPC. It was a clear case of vendetta after an inquiry absolved him from the BRD medical death case.
<blockquote>“As regards Dr Khan’s speech on December 12, first, I do not see how it attracts Sections 153A or 295A of the IPC. Second, even if it does, surely those provisions are sufficient to deal with the situation. The preventive detention order under the NSA is, therefore, clearly illegal, and should be struck down by the court,"</blockquote>
<a href="https://thewire.in/law/kafeel-khan-detention-nsa-illegal">says</a> Markandey Katju, retired judge, Supreme Court of India and an eminent jurist.

The NSA was <a href="https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/misuse-of-national-security-act-has-become-a-nightmare-for-the-muslims-in-muzaffarnagar">imposed</a> against 3 in a small village of Purbaliyan near Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh after a minor quarrel broke out between kids of the town over a cricket match because there were no specified boundaries to determine whether it’s a six or a four which later took a communal color.

The NSA was imposed against <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/bulandshahr-violence-blatant-misuse-nsa">3 men</a> in Bulandshahr district because they were accused of cow slaughter. It was followed by mob violence leading to the death of a police constable. Rather than imposing on people who were involved in the mob violence which resulted in the death of a police constable, the NSA was imposed against the 3 men which was a blatant misuse of the NSA.

A Manipur journalist, Kishorechandra Wangkhem, was detained for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46631911">criticizing</a> the head of the state of Manipur, N. Biren Singh and his parent party, Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). But when he was produced before the court, it termed the detention as illegal and he was set free. Within 24 hours, he was again arrested under the NSA for posting allegedly inflammatory statements. In no time, the advisory board set up under the act approved his detention for 12 months.

<strong>International Criticism</strong>

Although the act has drawn criticism from many intellectuals within the country, subsequently, it has drawn equal criticism from the international community as well. Many organizations working in the field of human rights as well as policy making have been, from the time of its inception, were critical of the act as well as of its usage. Some of them are listed for better understanding. The South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre (SAHRDC), in its submission to the NCRWC, recommended deleting those provisions of the Constitution of India that explicitly permit preventive <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23254642">detention</a>, amid the concern over the violation of Human Rights. Amnesty International in a public statement against the preventive detention of a human rights defender in Manipur <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/44000/asa200192009en.pdf">stated</a> that, “Amnesty International calls upon the Government of India to repeal the NSA, a legislation that has long been abused to arbitrarily detain a number of persons without trial on a range of criminal charges." The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative(CHRI), in its report on human rights violations in India, gave a report on various draconian pieces of legislation in India, which included the NSA too, and concluded:
<blockquote>“Rather than attempting to resolve security challenges politically where possible, or addressing the socio-economic roots of internal struggles, the knee-jerk response of the state has been to enact repressive legislation. Some of these laws plainly violate fundamental rights. While others, through imprecise and loosely worded provisions, have created an environment favourable to human rights abuses. Violation of rights in the name of security is all the more widespread as perpetrators are covered by de jure or de facto immunity.”</blockquote>
<strong>Conclusion- the way ahead</strong>

Quoting in the words of Justice A.P Sen, who wrote in his dissent in the case of Vijay Narain Singh V. State of Bihar,
<blockquote>"The detention of individuals without trial for any length of time, however short, is wholly inconsistent with the basic ideas of our government and the gravity of the evil to the community resulting from anti-social activities can never furnish an adequate reason for invading the personal liberty of the citizens except in accordance with the procedure established by law."</blockquote>
During the Constitutional Assembly <a href="https://www.constitutionofindia.net/constitution_of_india/fundamental_rights/articles/Article 22">debate</a>, when the question of law on preventive detention came up, Alladi krishnaswany Ayyar, a distinguished jurist, described preventive detention as a necessary evil because, in his view, there were people determined to undermine the sanctity of the Constitution, Security of the state and even individual liberty. But what the members tried to do was not to prohibit preventive detention but to incorporate <a href="https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/61884/">safeguards</a> against its abuse in the constitution by limiting the period, by giving effective powers to the advisory board to review detention orders, etc.

Yet, the act, brought about for the welfare of the people, has been used contrary to it. Politically motivated abuses of the National Security Act draw immediate disapproval from all those who care about freedom and liberty. However, the use of the NSA as a substitute for the ordinary criminal law is equally dangerous to the fundamental rights of Indian citizens and is probably a more prevalent type of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/aipub/2000/asa/32000800.htm">abuse</a>. Hence, there’s a need to make amendments to this legislation maybe not now, but in the near future, so that its currently prevailing loopholes are not exploited by the executive and it fulfills its constitutional obligation to stand for what was once coined by Abraham Lincoln as, “government of the people, by the people, for the people.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As COVID-19 spreads in different parts of the world, many countries have resorted to “national quarantine” or lockdown. Travel bans and closure of activities has resulted in a complete halt of society. Different countries are using their own set of domestic laws for planning action against the spread of Coronavirus. After declaring it a “pandemic”, the WHO <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-51839944">called</a> for countries to take measures in such a way that they “<em>strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing disruption and respecting human rights</em>.” India, along with several <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-on-lockdown-coronavirus-italy-2020-3?IR=T#in-italy-a-nationwide-lockdown-went-into-effect-on-march-10-that-restricts-virtually-all-aspects-of-life-for-its-60-million-citizens-including-retail-leisure-worship-imprisonment-and-travel-28">countries</a> has announced a nationwide lockdown to address public health concerns. One may argue that such lockdowns enjoy universal support as these are in the interest of the general public, but it must be ensured that the adopted measures fulfill some basic tenets of human existence, dignity, and capabilities — similar to what philosophers Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum have propounded in their “<a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/sen-cap/#H6">capability</a>” approach theory. It is thus imperative to go through the framework in which they are exercised.

<strong>Legal Framework of National Quarantine in Different Countries</strong>

Governments around the globe are relying on different kinds of laws rooted in either public health laws, police powers or specific legislation for quarantine. In contrast to the public health definition, mass quarantine is a legal term which can be loosely described as “civil <a href="https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1370&amp;context=facpub">confinement</a>.” Large scale quarantines have been rarely used except in massive outbreaks of disease like <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/23/white-scarf-door-lifesaving-lesson-1918-pandemic/">Spanish Flu</a> in 1917 and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6382747/">Ebola</a> in 2014. When the Government of India announced nationwide lockdown for 21 days, it resorted to <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/columns/indian-pandemic-control-laws-154567">two</a> pieces of legislation, namely, the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 (<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1005961/">EDA</a>) and the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1166740/">DMA</a>). The EDA Act is meant to be invoked by the Central Government when it is satisfied that the ordinary laws are <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/columns/indian-pandemic-control-laws-154567">ineffective</a> for dealing with such a situation, arising out of an outbreak of a dangerous epidemic disease. While the Disaster Management Act takes effect on announcement by the government based on what the government constitutes a ‘disaster’-- its legal framework has been said to be not very constitutionally <a href="https://theprint.in/theprint-essential/modi-govt-is-using-two-laws-to-tackle-coronavirus-spread-but-one-of-them-needs-changes/386052/">sound</a> as it is an implementation of pure executive actions only.

The framework &amp; <em>modus operandi</em> of the lockdowns amid this pandemic are much <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/china-s-aggressive-measures-have-slowed-coronavirus-they-may-not-work-other-countries">different</a> in other countries. Like, for instance, historically, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44443588">Britain</a> had its Quarantine Act of 1723 which was repealed later when it was held to be arbitrary. Now, the UK has <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/22">invoked</a> Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 for “mass quarantine." The recent lockdown is backed by <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2020/327/contents/made">regulations</a> issued under S. 13 of the said act-- underpinned with unlimited fines - in case of breach by persons and notified business concerns.

Spain, which is facing a worse scenario than most others, <a href="https://www.lw.com/thoughtLeadership/spain-imposes-royal-decree-463-2020-t-manage-covid19-health-crisis">imposed</a> a similar lockdown restricting movement of persons except for necessary purposes. It was promulgated under Royal decree 463/2020 laying down several broad <a href="https://www.lw.com/thoughtLeadership/spain-imposes-royal-decree-463-2020-t-manage-covid19-health-crisis">measures</a> -- including restrictions on the right to worship, commercial activity and other recreational activities. Other European countries such as Italy and Romania have complete lockdown under legal <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2020/03/09/20A01558/sg">decree</a> and military <a href="https://stirioficiale.ro/informatii/ordonanta-militara-nr-3-din-24-03-2020-privind-masuri-de-prevenire-a-raspandirii-covid-19">ordinance</a> respectively.

Canada used its quarantine act 2005 for the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Q-1.1/page-1.html#docCont">current</a> lockdown. This law was modified after the SARS outbreak of 2003, when some <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/migration/phac-aspc/publicat/sars-sras/pdf/sars-e.pdf">issues</a> arose regarding its application on maritime &amp; air travel. Section 6 of this act provides for the establishment of a Quarantine Station at any place of Canada and Section 7 prescribes conditions for Quarantine facilities. Section 12 and Section 13 of this act puts an obligation on the arriving and departing travelers to appear before a screening officer. Section 14 determines the situation when screening technology can be used. Commenting on its application, Steven Hoffman, professor of global health &amp; law at York University, <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-could-canada-bring-in-mass-coronavirus-quarantine-measures-like-italy/">remarked</a> that “Canada must apply this act in accordance with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.” In Australia, the current <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/coronavirus-covid19-self-isolation-announced-for-australia/12057772">restrictions</a> derive their authority under the new <a href="http://legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00303">Biosecurity Act</a>, 2015.

In the USA, mass quarantine is enacted by federal laws, notably, by the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (INA) and Public Health Service Act (<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:42%20section:264%20edition:prelim)%20OR%20(granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section264)&amp;f=treesort&amp;edition=prelim&amp;num=0&amp;jumpTo=true">PHSA</a>). Its section <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10415">212(f)</a> has been used for the first time to suspend the entry of all “foreign nationals...whom the president thinks...detrimental to the interests of the United States." Authority for these quarantine <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/pdf/Public-Health-Order_Generic_FINAL_02-13-2020-p.pdf">rules</a> comes from section 361 of the PHSA, which authorizes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue “necessary regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries." In the US, apart from these federal laws, states can use their respective state <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/186/380">powers</a> to curb the spread of disease. This varies from the public health <a href="https://casetext.com/regulation/new-jersey-administrative-code/title-8-health/chapter-57-communicable-diseases/subchapter-1-reportable-communicable-diseases/section-857-111-isolation-and-quarantine-for-communicable-disease">orders</a> which can also be issued by them.

<strong>Some Constitutional Concerns about Lockdowns</strong>

Sometimes, mass quarantines are seen as an intrusion on the liberty of moving freely and get questioned on other such constitutional <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hickox-v-christie-1">grounds</a>. The action of the state in such cases has been tested on the touchstone of constitutional liberty so that such policies reflect a fine balance between public health &amp; civil liberties. Governmental actions often face challenges on violation of the due process protection. The United States has witnessed several challenges to it in the past. The landmark case dealing with the challenge to quarantine law occurred in 1900, when a Louisiana state law forcing people to undergo quarantine was held <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/186/380">constitutional</a>. In this case, the constitutional challenge to the quarantines imposed for public health were somewhat, centered around the <em>involuntary <a href="https://casetext.com/case/addington-v-texas#p425">commitment</a></em> of people appearing in violation of substantive due process precedents. In the case of <span style="text-decoration: underline">County of Sacramento v. Lewis</span>, it was <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-1337.ZO.html">argued</a> that such measures of quarantine don’t take into account the fairness of the implementation procedure. The primary contention revolved around the question of whether the administration had adequate <a href="https://casetext.com/case/best-v-st-vincents-hospital">justification</a> for depriving people of their rights. The Court in this case held the Quarantine law to be constitutional. The reasoning can be understood by the <a href="https://casetext.com/case/henning-jacobson-v-commonwealth-of-massachusetts#p25">decision</a> of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Jacobson v. Massachusetts</span>, wherein the honorable Court stated “[a]lthough this court has refrained from any attempt to define the limits of [the state's police] power,...it has distinctly recognized the authority of a State to enact quarantine laws and health laws of every description.” Usually, such challenges are unlikely to succeed due to the high degree of public health risk associated with it. In case of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">United States ex rel. Siegel v. Shinnick</span> , the United States District Court, E.D. New York was <a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-ex-rel-siegel-v-shinnick">reluctant</a> to accept that such measures stand in violation of substantive due process.

There may be challenges to procedural due process requirements that specific deprivation by the government is acceptable to satisfy the need for restraint on liberty. However, due to the nature of the outbreak-- it will be tough to meet the requirements. On the impracticality of providing any pre-deprivation process, the US Supreme Court has <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/451/527/#539">held</a> that it may mean that post-deprivation remedy is constitutionally adequate. Such conditions were applied during the 2014 Ebola outbreak when quarantine was challenged. Then a federal court had <a href="https://casetext.com/case/hickox-v-christie-1">justified</a> the quarantines as being “necessarily prophylactic and peremptory." There is also the concept of “qualified immunity” to a state’s action in such times, unless it clearly contravenes the established constitutional rights. Apart from constitutional challenges, once this ends, a legal battle over workers' rights to job protection &amp; salary, safety etc. which were affected by quarantine will soon occur in many Courts.

In India and in other countries as well, a question may also arise on the proportionality factor in the quarantine policy. As basic <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449223/">protection</a> during quarantine does exist, officials are required to use the least restrictive method for enforcing the laws. Though individual rights give way before greater good, constitutional structure tolerates such substantial restriction for a limited period only. Recently, the Constitutional Court of South Africa had <a href="https://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/offbeat/concourt-dismisses-hola-bon-ngo-lockdown-coronavirus-2020/">dismissed</a> a plea against the lockdown on the ground that there were no “reasonable prospects of success.” However, it must be noted that the South African government has <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/foreign-international/covid-19-south-africa-appoints-former-constitutional-court-judge-to-safeguard-privacy-154860">appointed</a> former Constitutional Court judge, Justice Catherine (Kate) O'Regan, as the COVID-19 Designate Judge to safeguard individuals’ privacy and personal information in these critical times. It was acknowledged by the government while making this appointment that, “Whilst Government does all it can to implement measures to fight the spread of COVID19, the Designated Judge has an important role to play to safeguard the privacy and personal information of persons during this process.”

Regardless of the framework, scholars have advanced a constitutional <a href="https://www.acslaw.org/expertforum/state-quarantine-powers-under-the-constitution-fear-in-an-age-of-ebola/">standard</a> based on decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, for mass quarantine which were made in the aftermath of Ebola. A lockdown has to satisfy at least three key requirements. First, there must be an individualized risk assessment based on scientific evidence so that deprivation of his/her liberty can be justified. Second, the least restrictive means for advancing the state’s interests must be employed. Third, the state should provide hearing rights to individuals subject to quarantine procedural due process rights.

In a recent instance, the Constitutional Court of Kosovo (a country in Southeast Europe) has declared the restrictions imposed by the government on the movement of people as <a href="https://gjk-ks.org/en/decisions-from-the-review-sessions-held-on-30-and-31-of-march-2020/">unconstitutional</a>, because of a lack of legal backing around the decision. According to the court,
<blockquote>“The Government cannot restrict any fundamental right and freedom through decisions unless a restriction of the relevant right is provided by the law of the Assembly. The Government can only enforce a law of the Assembly that restricts a fundamental right and freedom only to the specific extent authorized by the Assembly through the relevant law.”</blockquote>
However, the Court set the date of entry into force of its Judgment as 13 April, 2020 and remarked that the relevant institutions and the Assembly should take appropriate measures to ensure that limitations on the fundamental right and freedom have been made keeping in view the health of public, according to the constitution of the Republic of Kosovo.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

These nation-wide lockdowns can enjoy universal support but their legal backing must be understood. The reason can be found in the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-america-constitution/608665/">words</a> of Mila Versteeg, professor of law at the University of Virginia, that, “bipartisan support for rights-restricting COVID-19 responses could smooth the path for constitutional erosion.” The lockdown announced should improvise facilities for the poorer sections of society who are to be most affected, not just by disease but also due to financial strains. The Courts have the authority to review government action, but there have to be certain merits to challenge these quarantines as they are taken in public interest. The greater responsibility lies on the part of responsible citizens to follow the measures taken by the government but at the same time the critical thinking on their part should not come to a halt at these critical times.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>What Is Parole?</strong>

Parole refers to the type of conditional freedom that is exercised by prisoners. In its conventional sense, it is a <a href="http://home.rajasthan.gov.in/content/dam/homeportal/homedepartment/pdf/RulesGroup12/8%20Rajasthan%20Prisoners%20Release%20on%20Parole%20Rules%201958.pdf">privilege</a> for the prisoner who is deemed to be fit to re-interact with society. Historically, parole comes out of military law and <a href="http://amesshdabas.com/2016/01/14/parole-laws-in-india/">denotes</a> the release of a prisoner of war on a promise to return. Parole has become an integral part of the English and American systems of criminal justice intertwined with the evolution of changing attitudes of the society towards crime and criminals. Parole and furlough ought not to be mingled with each other. In the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1188002/">case</a> of <u>Bhikabhai v. State of Gujarat</u>, “Furlough and parole have two different purposes. Furlough is a matter of right parole is not so...Parole is to be <a href="https://home.gujarat.gov.in/Upload/The_Prisons_Bombay_Furlough_and_Parole_Rules_1959_home_1_1_1.pdf">granted</a> only on sufficient cause such as cases of severe illness or death of any member of the prisoner's family.”

To be eligible for parole, the prisoner needs to appear for a parole hearing. If the authorities find him unsuitable, then his parole is canceled and he is made to appear in the next hearing, which is generally scheduled for years later. The necessary condition that needs to be taken into consideration at the time of granting parole is the behavior of the prisoner at the time of release. Only if it is suitable for society is he then eligible. Consequently, if the State Committee/District Committee accepts the recommendation of the District Magistrate, the prisoner shall be released on parole<span>.</span>

A prisoner on parole needs to <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-does-parole-work.html">abide</a> by certain conditions to enjoy freedom, such as avoiding any contacts with criminals and engagement in criminal activity, refraining from alcohol and drug use, getting engaged in one's employment, and not leaving their place of residence unless asked to do so. While giving parole, the authorities look for various factors such as the crime committed, past criminal record, improvement in behavior, and living conditions in the prison. Hence, this process requires scrutiny before passing a final order of parole.

<strong>Why Should Parole Be Considered a Right?</strong>

Parole has been an administrative decision. Once a prisoner applies and pleads for it, it is the decision of the executive authority of that prison. It is their prerogative to decide. In this way, eligible prisoners sometimes arbitrarily lose the chance to benefit. It is open to judicial review and interpretations vary from case to case. All criminal justice falls under Articles 14, 19, 21 of the Indian Constitution. The prisoner has the right to reach the court under Article 32 and 226 to seek remedy for executive arbitrariness. The “Head of the Prisons Department/Inspector General of Prisons will be the competent <a href="https://bprd.nic.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/5230647148-Model%20Prison%20Manual.pdf">authority</a> for granting release on leave.”

Special leave may be granted to a prisoner in special situations: for death or serious illness of a close relative, and for the marriage of a sibling or child. Such leave will be given after verifying the facts of the case by contacting the police by the quickest mode of communication available. Such leave can be for a maximum period of 14 days, excluding the journey time. The period spent on leave will be counted as sentence served, while that spent on special leave will not count as such. The period spent on special leave will be treated as “out days.”

The concern is whether authorizing parole as a right with reasonable restrictions provides a more confident and promising execution of it. There are certain manuals that govern the rights of the prisoners and the rules for the prison authorities. In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Prisons (Bombay Amendment) <a href="https://archive.org/stream/1953MH27/1953MH27_djvu.txt">Act</a>, the Jail Reforms Committee had recommended, and the government accepted, the recommendation that:
<blockquote>There should be the system of release of prisoners on furlough under which well-behaved prisoners of certain categories should, as a matter of right have a spell of freedom occasionally after they undergo a specified period of imprisonment so that they may maintain contact with their near relatives and friends and may not feel uprooted from society.</blockquote>
There are various international conventions and organizations which consider parole a right for the prisoners. For instance, the European Court of Human Rights has developed rich jurisprudence related to the issue of release on parole, as some judges believe that an irreducible life sentence (life sentence without the prospect of release) would <a href="https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/bjlp/9/1/bjlp.9.issue-1.xml?language=en">violate</a> the principle of human dignity. The African Commission on Human and People's Rights has also recommended some state parties amend their laws to provide for parole.

In the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1302814/">case</a> of <u>Smt. Poonam Lata v. M.L. Wadhawan &amp; Ors</u>, the court said that “[r]elease on parole is a wing of the reformative process and is expected to provide an opportunity to the prisoner to transform himself into a useful citizen.” Further, in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1669125/">case</a> of <u>Inder Singh &amp; Anr v. The State</u>, it is evident that the purpose of parole is to rehabilitate prisoners and make them more confident in their social lives. The objectives of parole discussed in the case are, “(1) to enable the inmate to maintain continuity with his family life and deal with family matters (2) to save the inmate from the evil effects of continuous prison life, and (3) to enable the inmate to maintain constructive hope and active interests in life.”

Parole as a right would have different impacts on different sections of society:

<strong>Prisoner</strong>: Man is a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/183896-man-is-by-nature-a-social-animal-an-individual-who">social</a> animal. Mental ideology plays a vital role in a person's behavior and thought process. The same goes for a prisoner. Social integration is part of a person’s life. A sense of belongingness in society is important and thus, parole as a right will lead to mental strength and behavioral changes for good.

<strong>Society</strong>: Positive interaction with a prisoner upon release with the society and young people may bring awareness to crime prevention and brutal torture in prisons.

<strong>Government</strong>: Parole not only creates a sense of belongingness but also helps the government reduce costs. Parole reduces prison overcrowding, granting offenders who are considered unlikely to harm others the benefit of supervised life in society. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, it <a href="https://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/incarceration-2010-06.pdf">costs</a> nearly eighty dollars a day to house an inmate in federal prison, but about nine dollars a day to supervise them in a community setting. Hence, granting parole acts as a cost-effective measure.

<strong>Family of the Convicted</strong>: Many families today only have income from one family member. If the prisoner is released on parole then he may make economic contributions to his family. If a person is convicted and was the sole wage-earner of the family then the economic dependence of the family becomes a cause of concern when the income is lost after imprisonment.

Reasonable restrictions must be imposed, as in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/186590629/">case</a> of <u>Subhash Hiralal Bhosale v. Prison Pune</u>, where the offender committed a crime while on parole and was sent back to prison.

In a conversation with a staff member of Central Jail Prison, Patiala, it appears that the execution of parole is still unambiguous. When one prisoner is granted parole and violates it, the rest of the prisoners are arbitrarily denied parole afterward. It is similar to taking a toy away from all children if one child has misused it. The rules and the manuals say that it is the District Magistrate who has the final authority to decide whether a prisoner is eligible for parole or not.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

We have discussed what parole is and how it works. Every coin has two sides and, similarly, parole has both negative and positive aspects. Parole augments the primary objective of prisons that is to make the convicts realize their fallacies and provide them with a platform to reform themselves and re-join the society as better citizens. Laws must be enacted in order to provide and protect the right to life of prisoners. Thus far, we have talked only about the reforms in the prison, but next, we must talk about reformation in the life of prisoners. Prisons are meant to transform prisoners, and thus it is necessary that they interact with the outside world. Now India must recognize prisoners as part of the society and make certain provisions to improve their standard of living.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>"The lockdown is a huge downside for victims exposed relentlessly to their abusers."</em> -Sanya Talwar</p>
It has been said that extenuation for violence will never end. Women have always been the worst sufferers of violence. Disasters, economic crises, and wars have all proven to be more fateful for women than men and exacerbate gender inequality. COVID-19 is no exception to that. This is not the situation of one country; many countries are facing the problem of domestic violence. A study conducted by Marianne Hester, a Bristol University Sociologist, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/sns-nyt-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-rises-worldwide-20200407-6kd46ga4hrfizoxmhz4dmiigja-story.html">suggests</a> that the violence increases whenever families spend more time together.

India’s National Commission for women <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/locked-abusers-india-domestic-violence-surge-200415092014621.html">received</a> an alarming 587 domestic violence complaints between March and April, a significant escalation from the 396 complaints during the month prior. The figures for other countries are also drastic. France reported a thirty-two percent rise in domestic violence during the outbreak. Domestic violence has increased threefold in China’s Hubei Province. New Zealand Police has released statistics demonstrating a twenty percent spike by the first Sunday after their lockdown started. In the US, the National Domestic Violence Hotline received 951 calls during a two-week period in March. Many US law enforcement agencies have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-see-rise-domestic-violence-calls-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-n1176151">registered</a> a steep increase since the COVID-19 lockdowns have begun. Even U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061052">asked</a> governments to incorporate some plans to combat domestic violence during this time.

<strong>How Are Courts and Governments Tackling Domestic Violence?</strong>

Countries are developing a proper mechanism to effectively respond to this problem. Though the conditions amidst the pandemic are different and accessibility to courts is difficult, rights for women are not dormant. We rely on the principle <em>Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium</em>, which means that where there is a right, there is a remedy. The courts in India are taking these matters sincerely. Recently, the Jammu and Kashmir High court took <a href="https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/high-court-takes-suo-motu-notice-of-lockdown-impact-on-women-73012">notice</a> of the correlation between the lockdown and increased domestic abuse. The Court issued directives to the Secretary, the Department of Social Welfare, and the governments of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. The Court added that special assistance should be provided to the women and children from economically weaker communities.

In India, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (<a href="https://www.icrw.org/files/images/Reducing-HIV-Stigma-and-Gender-Based-Violence-Toolkit-for-Health-Care-Providers-in-India-Annex-4.pdf">PWDVA</a>) was enacted in 2005 to facilitate the protection of women from any type of violence: physical, mental, emotional, verbal, or sexual. Section 8(1) of the act, which may be beneficial during the pandemic, provides for the appointment of Protection Officers. It reads as follows:
<blockquote>The State govt. shall, by notification appoint such no. of protection officers in each district as it may consider necessary and shall also notify the area or area within which a Protection Officer shall exercise the powers and perform the duties conferred on him or under this Act.</blockquote>
Section 5 imposes a duty on police officers, protection officers, service providers or the Magistrate to inform the aggrieved person about his rights. Subsection (d) also requires women to be notified of their right to make a complaint under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/538436/">Section 498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

The PWDVA also specifies the duties of shelter homes. It states that the aggrieved person or the protection officers can ask the person in charge of a shelter home to provide proper shelter to a victim. Section 11(a) of the PWDVA holds the government responsible for propagating and giving publicity to the provisions of this act. These measures should be properly put into effect which can be possible only with the help of the government.

The measures taken by the governments during the COVID-19 pandemic are highly applaudable. Argentina has declared pharmacies as safe spaces for victims. The Canadian government <a href="https://www.timminstoday.com/around-ontario/live-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-provides-covid-19-update-2226429">allocated</a> $200 million to Women and Gender Equality, Canada, to support shelter houses and various assault centers. France has carved out a unique way to help victims by providing them hotel rooms and arranging counseling services for them. Further, France will provide €1 million to anti-domestic abuse organizations. In India, the National Commission for Women has launched an alert number (+91 7217735372) for victims to call. Maximizing awareness for this number is essential. Also, non-profits may provide more support if their work is allowed under the umbrella of  “essential services." The United Nations (UN) has also urged governments to designate shelters as essential services.

These measures must be implemented immediately, otherwise, the harm from intimate terrorism will be devastating.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Students in our National Security Law course quickly learn that this area of the law is governed primarily by abstract constitutional rules, specific statutory grants of authority, and relatively little useful caselaw. Indeed, perhaps in no other area of the law has the Supreme Court deferred so explicitly to the perceived advantages and competence of the political branches, particularly the executive. In this way, the Supreme Court has diminished the role of the judiciary in national security decision-making.

The modern understanding of the constitutional structure, moreover, also mandates a diminished role for the states. The court in numerous cases has concluded that the framers, by delegating to Congress and the President the primary authority for national security matters, sought to locate security decision-making in the federal government. This position finds support, for example, in the allocations of power to Congress to raise and support armies and declare war; and to the President to lead the armed forces and control foreign intelligence gathering and analysis.

The framework makes sense given the kinds of threats the framers likely contemplated in 1787: physical invasion and the deleterious consequences of foreign machinations—that is, external threats. As for the many and varied domestic hazards to the safety and tranquility of the citizenry, the framers looked to the state governments and their expansive police powers. Policy approaches might differ from state to state, just as the nature of the dangers might differ, but success would breed success across the “laboratories of democracy,” as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously put it.

This model of national security decision-making privileges an understanding of “national security” that fails to capture the nature of threats that do not involve, say, military or clandestine action, or at least not primarily. Indeed, as the battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic demonstrates, the model fails to account sufficiently for the potential devastation that can be wrought by phenomena like disease, the potential consequences of which may be graver than the worst terrorist attack the nation has suffered, and with a greater potential to destabilize the nation in a variety of ways.

To this end, Oona Hathaway has <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/69563/covid-19-shows-how-the-u-s-got-national-security-wrong/">argued</a> that, in light of COVID-19, “[i]t is past time to rethink what national security should mean.” She suggests that we should “broaden the lens of national security to think about all serious global threats to human life,” including “pandemics, other public health threats, and climate change.”

Hathaway is right: non-military, non-terrorist threats have profound implications for national security. But it is also true that, in our globally interconnected world, there are potentially numerous incidents and phenomena that could in some way affect the health or well-being of a large swath of the citizenry. Because we may not be able rationally to draw lines between the concerns that the federal government should address and those that should fall to the states, perhaps we should pursue instead a framework that appropriately leverages the resources and capabilities of both the federal and state governments.

Faced with a pandemic, for example, federal policymakers could promote cooperative federalism and incentivize state governments to act in concert where such action would create economies of scale or more thoroughly thwart the spread of disease. In respect to the battle against COVID-19, we have seen both halting federal-state cooperation and nascent regional partnerships among states. Of course, the possibility that the country might, in a time of crisis, be led by a president who is not capable of addressing the emergency’s enormity should provide more reason to consider a national security framework that envisions an active role for state governments.

In the current situation, it makes little sense to assume that the federal government alone could be maximally effective in protecting Americans. Though the framers might have worried that states could undermine appropriate responses to an invasion by foreign troops, nothing in the constitution necessarily precludes the federal government from supporting joint state efforts to fight a pandemic, such as regional agreements as to when and how social distancing restrictions should be lifted.

A national security policymaking framework that does not privilege the federal government will raise many questions, not least the extent to which state governments can or should benefit from the deference the courts have shown the federal government in such matters. Though these questions require exploration, reconsideration of the traditional allocation of national security decision-making responsibility need not wait until we have all the answers. After all, this pandemic did not wait—and the next non-military, non-terrorist threat will not wait, either.

The death toll caused by COVID-19 has long surpassed the losses the nation suffered on September 11. Yet the pandemic shares some essential qualities with the terrorist attacks of that day, for like those attacks it has not only touched all of us, in one way or another; it promises to change the way we live. In response, it is time for us to view national security threats and the responses to those threats in a more expansive and flexible manner that more completely incorporates the notions of federalism established by our Founders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he was <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-nys-pause-extended-until-may-15">extending</a> the "NYS on Pause" restrictions until May 15th, halting all non-essential business in the state. Though the governor’s actions will ensure the health and safety of New Yorkers as the state continues battling the novel Coronavirus, "NYS on Pause" restrictions have tremendously impacted the state’s justice system. Courts across the state have been closed and case filings deemed nonessential have been suspended. The Child Victims <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/s2440">Act</a> and cases filed in relation to it have fallen under the nonessential umbrella, which has has left many child sexual abuse survivors and advocates unsure about the fate of their cases. These uncertainties only increased following the New York State Legislature’s <a href="https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/04/07/new-york-lawmakers-decline-to-extend-look-back-window-in-child-victims-act/">decision</a> to not extend the deadline to file in early April.

The Child Victims Act is a relatively new piece of legislation that was signed into law in February 2019 and has dramatically increased the legal rights and capabilities of child sexual abuse survivors in New York State. The CVA enables survivors of abuse to file a lawsuit without a notice of claim for sexual offenses committed against a minor and extends the legal deadline for filing criminal and civil charges against an abuser. The legislation also creates a one-year “look-back window,” which empowers any survivor to file a claim against their abuser regardless of when they were abused or their age at the time of the abuse.

The one year “look-back window” has proven to be an especially important component of the Child Victims Act. Experts agree the physical and emotional <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/somatic-psychology/201303/trauma-childhood-sexual-abuse">traumas</a> inflicted on survivors of child sexual abuse are devastating and many survivors do not come to terms with this trauma or even recognize that they were abused until they are grown adults. The look-back window ensures that adults who have recognized sexual abuse decades after the abuse has occurred are able to file criminal or civil suits against the perpetrators. Additionally, it enables adult survivors who were abused as children to seek damages from <a href="https://www.abuselawsuit.com/boy-scouts-sex-abuse/">institutions</a> like the Catholic Church and Boy Scouts of America for protecting known predators and allowing them to work in close proximity to children. These institutions had previously been able to escape prosecution in some cases by the statute of limitations.

The initial impact of the look-back window was immediate with over <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/sexual-assault-abuse/ny-court-pauses-childhood-sexual-abuse-lawsuits-during-covid-19-outbreak/">1,500</a> lawsuits filed between the time the window was opened through February 2020. However, as COVID-19 began to spread across the country and brought both public and private New York businesses to a screeching halt, the Child Victims Act filings were deemed non-essential business and all court filings were suspended until further notice.

New York State Senator Brad Hoylman, along with Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, sponsored the creation and implementation of the Child Victims Act for years before it was passed in 2019. Recently, Hoylman acknowledged the <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/brad-hoylman/senator-brad-hoylman-calls-child-victims-act-be-extended-after">implications</a> the "NYS on Pause" restrictions would have on survivors’ ability to take advantage of the look-back window, stating that “The massive unexpected interruption to our judicial system makes the need for extending the CVA more urgent than ever.”

According to Hoylman, extending the look-back window is the only solution. The extension would ensure that survivors have the time they need to assess their own situations and cases and eventually see their day in court once the restrictions on filings were lifted. Hoylman states that “It's always been prudent to extend the CVA's revival window,” citing New Jersey and California’s look-back windows as potential models for New York.

The two states have different, though similarly progressive, statutes to empower child sexual abuse survivors to take legal action against their abusers. New Jersey’s Bill <a href="https://www.nj.gov/governor/news/news/562019/approved/20190513c.shtml">S477</a> created a look-back window that opened on December 1st, 2019 and allows survivors to file claims until November 30th, 2021. The bill allows survivors of child sexual abuse and adult sexual abuse to file anytime within the two-year window. California’s Assembly Bill 218, one of the most recent in the country, allows survivors to file until they are 40 years old, recover triple the damages in the case of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-13/child-sexual-abuse-allegations-extension-filing-allegations-california-law">cover-up</a> of the abuse, and creates a three-year look back window for survivors of any age to file a suit. Both states have implemented their own social distancing restrictions in response to the Coronavirus, but have not faced the same levels of scrutiny from survivor advocacy groups given the multi-year look back windows in place.

Hoylman concluded his remarks on the Child Victims Act saying, “New York promised survivors in 2019 that we'd give them a chance to seek justice—and we must live up to that promise. We must extend the Child Victims Act's revival window for an additional year, either in standalone legislation or as part of the budget.”

Survivors of child sexual abuse have also spoken out regarding the potential extension of New York’s look-back window. Teri Hatcher and fellow child abuse survivor Tom Andriola <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-extend-the-lookback-window-20200330-uffzit55bnaf7iy2bvyg6voceq-story.html">advocated</a> for an extension for New York survivors in a powerful piece in the New York Daily News back in March with Hatcher recalling her own child-to-adult survivor experience.

Hatcher states in the article, “I never said anything [about her abuse] until years later when I read about another girl he abused who committed suicide as a result. My testimony eventually helped put him in jail, where he died. But for others like me, they have until 2023 to file a case. Those three years means more control to make the right decision.”

The disappointing decision to not extend the NYS deadline came at an especially bad time as April is both Sexual Assault Awareness Month and Child Abuse Prevention Month. Many events and campaigns to bring awareness to these causes have had to be canceled or postponed as social distancing restrictions continue around the country.

The latest inaction by New York lawmakers is not the end of the road for those relying on the Child Victims Act. The look-back window remains open until August 2020 and, though the Coronavirus is still keeping courts closed for now, there is hope New York could ease restrictions heading into summer. Until then, survivor support organizations and survivors themselves continue to advocate to ensure that anyone affected by child sexual abuse will have the opportunity to seek justice in court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The “doctrine of frustration” and “force majeure” have become crucial facets of law in the time of the global pandemic, COVID-19, and have become crucial facets of contracts and accountability. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/124768/">Section 32</a> and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/648614/">section 56</a> of Indian Contract Act, 1872 play an important role in this.

<strong>Introduction:</strong>

The spread of Coronavirus had an enigmatic repercussion on almost every sector. Every contractual obligation including sponsorship contracts is being affected by COVID-19. It has not only affected India’s economy, but also affected other countries’ economies too like the United Kingdom. One sector most affected by this pandemic is the sports industry. Many championships and games scheduled this year including the UEFA European Championship and the Tokyo Olympic Games have been postponed from 2020 to 2021. The Indian Premier League (IPL) too has been postponed. As we should know, every tournament and championship contains so many contracts and there is also an agreement between every sport tournament comptroller and television broadcasters. So, due to the prevalence of this pandemic, will there be any lawful action against party who is unable to perform contractual obligations by an aggrieved party? If the answer to this question is no then what is safeguarding them? The answer to this question will be no because of some exceptions given under English as well as Indian law, popularly known as the doctrine of frustration and the doctrine of force majeure.

If any person is unable to perform any contractual duty, they will not be liable for not fulfilling those duties if they have a valid defense under the concept of force majeure or the common law doctrine of frustration.

<strong>Force Majeure or Act of God</strong>

Under contract law, force majeure is a provision which absolves a party from non-performance of contractual obligations which is caused by circumstances or events out of the parties’ control and makes performance impossible. These events may include war, floods, drought, civil unrest or terrorist attack, or sudden natural calamities. Covid-19 could effectively be covered under natural calamities and so parties can claim a defense under force majeure. This clause needs to be reexamined or else Covid-19 could be upheld for each and every contract.

The 148-year-old law, Indian Contract Act, 1872 controlling Indian contracts has not expressly referred to force majeure. But, Section 32 and Section 56 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 have relevancy in such a circumstance.

Section 32 of ICA,1872 talks about the enforcement of contracts contingent on an event happening i.e. contingent contracts to do or not do anything based on if an uncertain future event happens, cannot be enforced by law unless and until the event has happened. If an event becomes impossible in itself the event becomes void under this section. Here are some illustrations:
<blockquote>Illustration: 1) A, a person, contracts with another person, B, that A will pay B if B marries C. If C then dies without marrying B. Now this contract becomes void.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Illustration: 2) A, a person, makes a contract with another person, B, for buying B’s horse if A survives C. This contract of obligation cannot be enforced unless and until C dies in A’s lifetime.</blockquote>
Section 56 talks about agreements to do impossible acts: An agreement to do an impossible act is void in itself. And impossibility of contract or performance of contract is the central idea upon which the Doctrine of Frustration is based. And both these words are used as convertible expressions. Generally, Doctrine of Frustration can be applied in many cases but mostly applicable in two cases which are: 1) When the object of a contract becomes impossible to execute, or, 2) When any unforeseen event occurs which is beyond the control of the bound party and which makes the performance of the contract impossible. Here are some illustrations of Section 56:
<blockquote>Illustration: 1) A, a person, contracted to sell the horse to B on 1st January 2020. But the horse died on 31st Dec. Therefore, the previously made contract between A and B becomes void because the object of the contract is not in existence.</blockquote>
Illustration 2 is more relevant to the present context:
<blockquote>Illustration: 2) A, a resident of India, entered into a contract with B, a resident of another country i.e. China. Some portion of the contract was performed but a major portion was still to be performed and the Government of India declares war on China and suspends all transaction with China. After this the contractual obligation becomes void and party who is unable to perform his obligation can claim the defense of impossibility of contract.</blockquote>
There are some specific situations in which the doctrine of frustration applies:

• <strong>Change of circumstances: </strong>A contract will frustrate where circumstances arise which make the performance or fulfillment of contact impossible in the manner and the time contemplated.
• <strong>Death or incapacity of Party:</strong> A party to a contract is excused from performance of the contract if it depends upon the existence of the given person and that person dies or becomes too ill to perform.
• <strong>Government, Administrative or Legislative Intervention:</strong> A contract will perish when legislative or administrative intervention has so directly operated upon the specific performance of the contract as to change the contemplated conditions of fulfillment.

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic meets the first situation, making doctrine of frustration a defense against the obligations to fulfill a contract. Hence, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus an Act of God and parties to a contract can use Coronavirus as a defense or protection from legal consequences.

<strong>English Law Perspective:</strong>

The roots of the common law doctrine of frustration come from the <a href="https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/3711">decision</a> in the case Taylor VS. Caldwell, (1861-73). In this case it was held that if some unforeseen circumstance occurs during the performance of a contract which makes it impossible to perform, in the way that the fundamental basis of the contract requires, it need not be further performed, as insisting upon such performance would be unjust. Prior to this decision, a contract had to be performed no matter what unforeseen events came. So, previously the law of contracts in England was extremely rigid.

The Supreme Court of India explained the ambit of Section 56 of ICA, 1872 in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1214064/">case</a> Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur and Co., 1954. The Court established a few principles in this decision. The court held that he word ‘impossible’ in Section 56 does not mean physical or literal impossibility. And a contract will be held impracticable or impossible based on the purpose and object of the promissor. The court additionally held that if unforeseen events upset the very foundation upon which the parties entered their agreement, the contract can be said to be frustrated. So, in this case, war conditions were known to both the parties and while making the contract both the parties were aware of the difficulty. In such a situation, the requisition of property did not affect the root of the contract. Hence, the contract between Bangur and Ghose wasn’t possible due to the prevalent conditions of war. Bangur sought defense or protection under Section 56 of ICA,1872.

<strong>Does Spread of COVID-19 in the Aggregate Qualify as an Act of God?</strong>

For any act to be considered an Act of God, it must be unusual, extraordinary, grave and sudden such that it is very hard to foresee such a turn of events. Conclusively, COVID-19 cannot be considered an Act of God by the court. This is a decision the court will soon have to face.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This affects all the sectors across the country and various countries’ economies. In this scenario, force majeure will be the determining factor to understand the significance of these circumstances. The scenario of India in case of force majeure will vary from case to case depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Under Indian Law and English Law both there is no allowance to escape from any contractual obligation and any party still faces strict liability. So, force majeure and the doctrine of frustration play very crucial roles in non-fulfillment of performance of contracts.

Lastly, I would like to end with a legal maxim which is based on the doctrine of frustration: "les non cogit ad impossibilia" which means "a man cannot be compelled by law to do what he cannot possibly perform."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2020/2020scc5/2020scc5.html">judgment</a> of the Supreme Court of Canada in <span style="text-decoration: underline">Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya</span>, allowed for a claim to be filed against a Canadian company for human rights violations and breaches of customary international law (CIL) abroad. The legal development realized corporate liability for human rights violations, which is necessary given that human rights law has traditionally been confined to analyzing the infringement of rights by state actors. However, with incidents such as the Bhopal Gas Tragedy in India, the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, and the Fukushima nuclear power plant explosions in Japan, there is need now, more than ever, to hold corporations accountable.

<strong>The Case Before the Court</strong>

Three Eritrean workers, and former employees of Nevsun Resources Ltd., claimed that they were conscripted through Eritrea’s military service into a forced labor regime where they were required to work at a mine in Eritrea owned by the Canadian company (headquartered in Vancouver). Over the course of their work in the mines, the workers claimed that they were subjected to violent, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The claim was brought by these workers for damages in lieu of violation of domestic torts, as well as for breaches of certain CIL norms. Nevsun sought to dismiss the claims arguing that Eritrea was a more appropriate forum to litigate, and that the claims of breaches of CIL were liable to be struck down because there was no reasonable likelihood of success.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2020 ruled that there was no bar to the workers’ claims being heard. The Court reasoned that Canada automatically incorporated CIL into domestic law via the doctrine of adoption. Which meant that prohibitions on forced labor, slavery, and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment — which form part of CIL, are a part of Canadian jurisprudence. On the basis of this, the Court recognized that it may well develop a civil remedy in domestic law for corporate violations of the CIL norms adopted in Canadian jurisprudence.

<strong>Need for Alternative Frameworks for Corporate Accountability at the Domestic Level</strong>

The Canadian Supreme Court shed light on a necessary factor in terms of realizing corporate human rights violations in the era of globalization — namely, the necessity to find concrete solutions in the domestic realm. However, there have been several instances where rights are yet to be vindicated. Some of them are massive instances of corporate violations of human rights in the Global South. In the case of Rana Plaza, the courts <a href="https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/top-court-releases-decision-in-2-billion-building-collapse-lawsuit-against-loblaws-1004166803/">operated</a> in a legal vacuum, and people still fight for the right to be heard before Canadian courts. Similarly, despite numerous years having passed after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy in India, several individuals are yet to receive compensation and there are numerous birth <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/bhopal-gas-tragedy-34-years-after-leak-survivors-continue-to-fight-for-proper-rehabilitation-1957919.html">defects</a> to this day in Bhopal.

Other tools within national legal frameworks may be beneficial at the grassroots level to combat human rights violations by corporate actors. One such way is by expanding the notion of ‘stakeholders’ in domestic corporate law. India, for instance, incorporated <a href="http://mca.gov.in/SearchableActs/Section166.htm">Section 166(2)</a> to the Companies Act, 2013, which thrust upon the director of a company, a duty towards the community and the environment, at large. This imposes an actionable duty on the directors of a company to undertake development strategy with pluralistic stakeholders and their specific considerations in mind.

Another avenue, given the complexity of supply-chains, is via the forum of consumer protection laws which demands greater transparency in the business process. <a href="https://freedomfund.org/blog/samsungs-indictment-in-france-fighting-transnational-corporations-human-rights-violations-through-consumer-law/">Samsung’s</a> indictment in France for worker exploitation and health hazards was seen as a success to combat human rights’ violations through consumer litigation. The indictment was for misleading advertisement (a criminal offence in France) and allowed for compensation to the workers. Similarly, in Germany, a consumer protection agency won a lawsuit against <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/lidl-lawsuit-re-working-conditions-in-bangladesh">Lidl</a> concerning the working conditions in Bangladesh.

With structures like this within states which are often the situs for exploitation, developing robust systems of accountability via corporate law and consumer protection law provides better tools to engage with such jurisdictionally complex cases and to pierce the ‘corporate veil’ as opposed to solely relying on international law and its tenets.

		<title>China Cries Foul Over India’s Revised FDI Rules</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In light of the economic outlook during the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of credit in the market will decide the sustainability of a country. India has taken caution to combat “opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions” by tightening its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for all border-sharing nations. This has particularly affected China, due to its major role in the Indian market as compared to other neighboring states. On April 17, the consolidated FDI Policies were <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1615711">revised</a>. An earlier provision stated:
<blockquote>A non-resident entity can invest in India, subject to the FDI rules except in those sectors/activities which are prohibited. However, a citizen of Bangladesh or an entity incorporated in Bangladesh can invest only under the Government route. Further, a citizen of Pakistan or an entity incorporated in Pakistan can invest, only under the Government route, in sectors/activities other than defense, space, atomic energy, and sectors/activities prohibited for foreign investment.</blockquote>
This provision permitted a non-resident to invest in FDI without prior government approval or under an automatic route. The revised position has two changes:
<ol>
 	<li><span> </span>All the seven border sharing countries of India now require government approval, which shuts down the automatic route for China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal, and Afghanistan.</li>
 	<li><span> </span>If there lies an investor who is permitted to invest in India through FDI under automatic route but the “beneficial owner” belongs to any of India’s neighboring countries, in such cases prior government approval is also required. It extends the impact of this Press Note beyond the border sharing countries. In all likelihood, the definition of “beneficial owner” will be drawn from the Companies <a href="https://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/CompaniesAct2013.pdf">Act</a> and the Companies (Significant Beneficial Owners) <a href="https://taxguru.in/company-law/companies-significant-beneficial-owners-amendment-rules-2019-analysis.html">Rules</a> and affect deal exits and transfers of ownership. Exit and transfer might be impacted as far as the transfer results in the transferee becoming a shareholder in an Indian company and such transactions could require government approval as well. There is no clarity in determining whether the beneficial owner is the significant beneficial owner (per the rules) or not and it should be further clarified by the government.</li>
</ol>
<strong>A Protectionist Measure</strong>

The decision was made just days after the People's Bank in China (PBoC) raised its stakes in India’s largest non-banking mortgage provider (HDFC) by over one percent. In addition, the center has blocked the indirect acquisition of investments by entities based in China. The new rules will also apply to all the existing and planned investments by foreign firms in Indian businesses.

<strong>Impact on Chinese Funded Companies </strong>

The change in the FDI rules was a timely decision to prevent any kind of hostile takeovers. Some experts say that the government could look at a blanket ban on the automatic route, not just for the neighboring nations, and others suggest how naming some specific sectors would have been a better option as it would not have impacted overall FDI flow in India. Top Indian start-ups, such as Big Basket, Ola, and Paytm, could become collateral damage as they are funded by Chinese players who could be deterred by the new rules. Eighteen of India’s thirty “unicorn” start-ups are Chinese funded. Fresh investments from these companies will now face additional scrutiny. Removal of the automatic route could increase approval time and lengthen the timelines of the deals going forward. This could also force such start-ups to look elsewhere for funding. Due to the lockdown, the operational requirements of the start-up Big Basket were not met, therefore Alibaba had to provide $50 million in funding. The revised FDI rules may force a company to look for other options for meeting funding requirements. Similarly, Indian company Flipcart has about five percent of its investment from Tencent; Paytm raised $1 billion from Japan’s SoftBank and Alibaba’s Ant Financial; Zomato is backed by Chinese venture capital, which will be severely impacted by the revised rule. In a competitive market where a company needs more investments to remain in the market, the new rules can stifle the growth of the company.

Apart from the start-ups, the new rules might also impact other sectors. For example, the Chinese company Fosun acquired Indian Gland Pharma for $1.1 billion in 2018. This accounted for almost eighteen percent of Chinese FDI into India. This is inclusive of the $300 million investment by MG Motors. Companies such as Xiaomi have also come to India via the FDI route. Similar restrictions can also be imposed on External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) from these countries in the future. These revised rules can impact the investment in processing these deals as well.

With the US and European economies taking significant hits from the spread of the coronavirus, foreign investors might look for other places to invest where there are lower production and operational costs and fewer restrictions. India may be a perfect fit if it matches the high paced manufacturing in Special Economic Zones (SEZ) and free trade zones.

<strong>Is China’s Cry of Foul Justified? </strong>

China protested against these changes in FDI policies and claimed India violated WTO Principles of non-discrimination. The Chinese Embassy stated:
<blockquote>The additional barriers set by Indian for investors from specific countries violates WTO's principle of non-discrimination and goes against the general trend of liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. We hope India would revise relevant discriminatory practices, treat investments from different countries equally, and foster an open, fair and equitable business environment.</blockquote>
The tweaking of the FDI rules of India did not violate WTO principles, as there exists no agreement directly in relation to Foreign Direct Investment in the WTO. <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/invest_e/trims_e.htm">Article 1</a> of the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) states that it is applicable to investment measures related to trade in goods only, which rules out any connection to the revised FDI with WTO. As the revised rules do not directly affect goods, put caps on equity, restrict market access, or place restrictions on specific nations, they are not in violation of any WTO agreement. It only proposes another route for FDI, which is for India to protect its companies from hostile acquisitions or takeovers by China. India is protecting its industry and is well within its right to do so, just like Australia, Germany, and the European Union have recently tightened their investment rules.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The global pandemic of Covid-19 has raised concerns of the global economic recession. As a protectionist approach, India has altered its FDI rules to curb hostile takeovers from its border-sharing countries by closing the door to automatic investments for all such countries and mandating government approval. No open reference to any discrimination is made amongst these countries but the focus of this regulatory change is undoubtedly China. It will be interesting to see how India will tackle and regulate the uncertainty of investments from China in coming future after revised FDI rules. Big Indian corporations like Tata and Adani have huge investments in China and the annual revenue of Indian companies in China ranges from three to twenty percent of the global total. Bilateral investment relations are the key to trade for India. These investments will be affected in the near future, but to what extent is yet to be seen. India has taken a defensive approach while dealing with FDI due to the coronavirus pandemic but is only a temporary measure and what its impact after the pandemic will be can only be answered in the future. A major portion of start-ups are dependent upon China’s investment and China’s urge to revise the rules clearly shows that these start-ups will be affected in the future. There have been different reactions to the rule changes, which mostly portray the need for a check on FDI from China.

		<title>PM CARES Fund and PMNRF: Analyzing the Associated Legal Concerns</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the entire world is groped by the life threatening Coronavirus, our Prime Minister launched the PM CARES Fund through a thread of <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1243861073444237314?s=20">tweets</a> on March 28, 2020 to gather public contributions to fight against the pandemic. Within the first 15 minutes of the launch of the fund, it began receiving huge donations. Within 25 minutes, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar pledged a sum of 25 crore to the fund. The launch of this fund was surprising to a lot of people because of the existence of a very similar fund called PMNRF.

Shortly after its announcement a lot of people including opposition party leaders, journalists, legal professional etc pointed out the redundancy of creating this fund. But the government seemed to be unmoved by this criticism and didn’t provide any concrete answers as to the purpose of this fund. Even if this fund is a duplication of PMNRF (which it does appear to be), it is also a needless replica of a faulty model.

<strong>Mutatis Mutandis</strong>

The PMNRF or the Prime Minister National Relief Fund was established in 1948 by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. It was established with the initial objective to gather public contributions for providing assistance to the displaced people of Pakistan. After that, it has been used for providing relief to the victims of natural disaster, riots and war and also to defray medical expenses etc. It receives no budgetary support and is funded completely by public contribution. It has been recognized as a ‘trust’ under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and contribution to the fund has been granted exemption from Income Tax under <a href="https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/_layouts/15/dit/mobile/viewer.aspx?path=https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/acts/income-tax%20act,%201961/2018/102120000000071009.htm">section 10</a> and <a href="https://incometaxindia.gov.in/_layouts/15/dit/Pages/viewer.aspx?grp=Act&amp;cname=CMSID&amp;cval=102120000000521000&amp;searchFilter=[%7B%22CrawledPropertyKey%22:1,%22Value%22:%22Act%22,%22SearchOperand%22:2%7D,%7B%22CrawledPropertyKey%22:0,%22Value%22:%22Income-tax%20Act,%201961%22,%22SearchOperand%22:2%7D,%7B%22CrawledPropertyKey%22:29,%22Value%22:%222019%22,%22SearchOperand%22:2%7D]&amp;k=&amp;IsDlg=0">139</a> of the act. It is also <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/2098?view_type=browse&amp;sam_handle=123456789/1362">exempt</a> from the Foreign Contribution Act, 2010.

Many questions and issues have been raised regarding the legality and constitutionality of the PMNRF and the creation of PM CARES on the same lines with slight changes. The new fund appear to raise the same issues again with an additional question of the need of duplication.

The replication of PMNRF seems to indicate that there is no purpose for the creation of this other than presenting the people with some ‘showpiece’ measure and telling the public that the government is taking huge measures to fight the pandemic while it is actually not.

<strong>Inherent Legal Problems</strong>

<strong>Private vs. Public Nature of the Funds</strong>

In Aseem Takyar v. Prime Minister National Relief Fund (2016), an <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/155613677/">appeal</a> was filed before the Delhi High Court contending that PMNRF being a ‘public authority’ must come under the jurisdiction of the Right to Information <a href="https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf">Act</a>, 2005. The plea was accepted and an appeal was made. In the appeal, the fund contended that
<blockquote>“It finds its genesis in a personal appeal made through a press note dated 24.01.1948 by the then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. This, according to the Fund, was a personal appeal/request/decision and not an order/decision made by the Government of India. The Fund further contended that this appeal/request/decision was not a decision of the Central Government and was thus not made in the name of the Hon'ble Governor General of India, the head of Central Executive, as was then required for decisions of Central Government.”</blockquote>
Due to the split in the division bench, a decision was not reached as to the status of the PMNRF.

But even if the stance of government is that PMNRF is ‘private’ in nature, the access to information still cannot be denied because <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/198883545/">Section 19</a> of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 says “A trustee is bound (a) to keep clear and accurate accounts of the trust-property, and (b), at all reasonable times, at the request of the beneficiary, to furnish him with full and accurate information as to the amount and state of the trust-property.” Hence, the citizens of India being the beneficiary of these funds, can ask for information related to the fund.

<strong>The Accountability Quotient</strong>

As envisaged by Nehru, the PMNRF was managed by a managing committee which also comprised a member from India’s private business sector and the president of Congress party till 1985, but after that year when Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister, he authorized the managing power entirely to the PMO. The PM, from then on, has the power to appoint a secretary of the funds on his sole discretion. The determination of who can be a beneficiary of the fund is also on the sole discretion of the PM. Although, the highly controversial position given to the president of congress was removed, the PMO was given the sole discretion, thereby, affecting the accountability.

Plus, the fund should also be covered by the provisions of article 151 (1) of the constitution and be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India instead of third party auditing which will ensure more transparency and accountability.

<strong>Legal Backing of the Tax Benefits: Section 80 G</strong>

Contributions to both these funds are eligible for 100% tax exemption under Section 80 G of the Income Tax Act, 1961. But in order to be registered as a ‘public charitable trust’ under 80 G to obtain exemption benefits a due process has to be followed. This process involves obtaining a valid certificate by the trust. For getting this certificate, the trust has to submit its application and 10 G form along with the trust deed to the Income Tax Office. The section also lists several conditions to follow for procurement of certificate, one of them is that “The public charitable trust has to be registered under relevant laws and with the income tax department.” Hence, the fund also needs to be registered under The Registration Act, 1908. It is very important to know whether due process has been followed because otherwise the fund lacks a legal backing.

<strong>Article 266, 283 and 284 of the constitution</strong>

Creation of both these funds also has an incoherence with article 266, 283 and 284 of the constitution. Article 266 (2) states that “all other money (other than consolidated and contingency fund of India) received by or on behalf of the government shall be entitled to the Public Account of India.” And article 283 (1) states that:
<blockquote>“The custody of the Consolidated Fund of India and the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys into such Funds, the withdrawal of moneys therefrom, the custody of public moneys other than those credited to such Funds received by or on behalf of the Government of India, their payment into the public account of India and the withdrawal of moneys from such account and all other matters connected with or ancillary to matters aforesaid shall be regulated by law made by Parliament, and, until provision in that behalf is so made, shall be regulated by rules made by the President.”</blockquote>
Hence, parliamentary oversight is necessary in this matter to ensure that the provisions of constitution are not getting violated or the President, for the time being, needs to come up with a proper set of rules to be followed regarding these funds.

A PIL in this regard was <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/126750916/">filed</a> by advocate ML Sharma. In the case Manohar Lal Sharma V. Narendra Damodas Modi &amp; ors. (2020), the petitioner contended that the government should rescind the PM CARES Fund on the ground that it is not constitutional as it has not been enacted under article 266 or 267 of the constitution or passed by the parliament or approved by the President. The bench headed by SA Bobde dismissed the plea calling it a “misconceived petition”.

<strong>The Unused ₹3800 Crore</strong>

The unused amount of ₹3800 crore lying in the PMNRF has also attracted a lot of questions. The government hasn’t provided an answer as to why it created a separate fund when such a big amount is there in a fund was created for the same purpose. In 2018-19, the PMNRF made an investment of ₹1301 crore in the State Development Loans (SDL) and invested ₹250 crore as FDs in IDFC Bank. These facts indicate that for the past few years government has been earning by way of investing the fund’s money. This raises the question that the creation of the new fund can be due to the fact that PMNRF’s money had become an investment-vehicle.

<strong>The Say of the Opposition: Could Have Been a Step Forward?</strong>

Incorporating the say of the opposition leader in the fund by making her/him a part of the managing committee could have been another step forward towards ensuring better accountability of the fund. The PM CARES Fund is comprised of the Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister as its members. Although, the PM has the power to nominate three persons to the fund from different fields, inclusion of the opposition could have helped dilute the concentration of power in hands of government. Opposition has always played a very strong role in democracy by questioning the government and highlighting flaws to the public. Opposition leaders are member of various parliamentary committees. They also have a say in the appointment of heads of various departments and hence, inclusion of the opposition could have been one of those concrete reasons that could have justified formation of a new fund by providing more transparency and accountability.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

After analysing both the funds, it can be said that neither of them is perfect. But this does not reduce the redundancy of creating the PM CARES Fund because it is in no way modelled to be better than the PMNRF. It lacks constitutional explanation and the government has still not addressed the concerns raised. This situation is alarming as the fund is receiving huge donations and has already become a target of fraud. People have lost their money because of fraudulent activities like creation of similar name funds, similar websites etc. Even one of BJP Maharashtra prominent leaders tweeted the fake id – pmcaresfund.in instead of <a href="http://pmindia.gov.in">pmindia.gov.in</a>. An honest mistake or a deliberate fraud. Anyway, the government has to take constructive steps to deal with the concerns rising up by first addressing the immediate problems of such fraudulent activities. According to a survey, there has been a sudden jump in Covid-19 cybercrimes. Therefore, the government has to increase the awareness for the same. And then address all the legal concerns associated because they are not any less important. Better frameworks for transparency need to be worked out and legality of the fund needs to be specified.

This fund is receiving huge amounts of donations for the cause, so it is only good to hope for the time being that this Fund is not merely a publicity meatball in the name of Prime Minister, but it actually ‘cares’ for the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On 24th March, 2020, the Government of India announced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html">lockdown</a> throughout the nation in an effort to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the largest such lockdown globally. With each passing day of the lockdown, India like other countries, is witnessing a rise in cases of domestic <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-rise-in-domestic-violence-across-all-strata-of-society-in-the-coronavirus-lockdown-period/350249">violence</a> against women. In India however, the scope of these victims changes in line with the socio-economic contexts peculiar to Indian society. Indian media coverage has failed to focus on the violence faced by ‘<em>live-in</em>’ female domestic workers during this lockdown, who have historically faced a large threat of violence and abuse at their employers’ homes.

The present lockdown will only aggravate instances of abuse against them - which have mostly remained undocumented owing to the private <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/domestic-helps-abuse-exploitation">nature</a> of their job. Throughout this article, we wish to discuss the general lack of strong legislative protection for domestic workers in India and how this void makes them vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of their employers. Unlike other victims, these workers do not have any effective redressal mechanisms against such abuse. Using the present circumstances of the lockdown, we wish to remind the government to take up the oft-deferred task of legislating on the rights of domestic workers on a priority basis.

Domestic workers are one of the most unorganized and informal classes of workers in India. As per government <a href="http://mospi.nic.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/nss_report_554_31jan14.pdf">estimates</a>, there are approximately 4,000,000 domestic workers in India. Out of this, around 2.6 million workers (65%) are female. There are of course, different kinds of domestic workers in India. First there are those who shuffle between multiple houses in a day and may have fixed working hours and activities at each house. Then, there are those workers who live at the employer’s house itself. Their work hours are 24/7 and they are required to do all household work that may possibly come up at any time of the day. The latter category of workers are referred to as the ‘<a href="https://www.ijitee.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i1/A2526118118.pdf">live-in</a>’ workers.

In light of the current lockdown, while a few of these live-in workers may have found their way back to their homes in small towns and villages, a large number of them still remain behind at their employers’ houses. This may be attributed to a number of reasons. <em>First</em> - the large scale <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/life-lockdown-brutal-indias-female-day-laborers/story?id=69893685">suspension</a> of public transport services, which is the only viable and affordable means of travel for them. <em>Second</em> - the apprehension of being exposed to infection on long and tedious journeys back to their hometowns. <em>Third</em> - and most importantly - pressures exerted by employers upon the workers. Lockdowns mean having the entire family staying together under one roof for prolonged periods of time. This results in increased volumes of household chores. Employers may pressure the workers to stay back either by threatening to terminate their services, or by refusing to grant them paid leaves. Some may also entice the workers with a higher pay. The needs and interests of workers are thus exploited to place workers in a dilemma between their health on the one hand, and their livelihood on the other. Needless to say, a majority of them choose the latter and are thus prevented from leaving their employers’ homes.

Since domestic work is largely confined to private households, it is shielded from public scrutiny. Such privacy lends itself to increased vulnerability of domestic workers to physical, verbal and sexual abuse. Examples of verbal abuse may be offensive language, disrespect and making lewd remarks. Physical abuse may range from touching without consent, groping and fondling to manhandling, confinement, physical torture and rape.

In 2014, the Indian Government released <a href="https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=103336">records</a> relating to violence against maid servants across the country. These records showed a steady rise in the number of reported cases annually. Not surprisingly, states with large metropolitan cities such as Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu witnessed the highest number of registered cases. In June 2018, the Martha Farrell Foundation undertook a <a href="http://www.marthafarrellfoundation.org/uploaded_files/pdf_files/1529667465_First report.pdf">survey</a> about sexual harassment among domestic workers in South Delhi. An overwhelming 92% of the survey’s respondents recognized the different kinds of sexual harassment as happening around them, however only 29% admitted to actually having faced it themselves. Such reluctance in complaining may be attributed to illiteracy, lack of legal awareness, the fear of losing one’s livelihood and the shame and stigma associated with talking about such sensitive issues.

The circumstances of a lockdown only worsen the plight of domestic workers. If such abuse is considered routine for them on any regular day, one can only imagine the magnitude to which their problems may be aggravated in times when citizens are ordered to stay within the confines of their house. As necessary as the lockdown may be, it has effectively snatched away their means of escape and muffled any outlet for protest.

Our discussion above yields an important question: how could we have avoided such a situation? Historically, there has been a plethora of discussion about introducing a stronger rights-based regime for domestic workers in India. However, till date, no such policy or legislation exists. Presently in India, there exist two pieces of legislation that concern themselves with domestic workers. These are the Unorganised <a href="http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A2008-33.pdf">Workers’</a> (Social Security) Act, 2008 and the Sexual <a href="http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A2013-14.pdf">Harassment</a> of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

The former fails in guaranteeing basic rights to domestic workers and its enforcement has been largely ineffective for them. The latter fails to tailor itself to the peculiarities of the domestic work profession, and is thus inadequate in trying to address the grievances of domestic workers. The domestic worker continues to be denied the status of a rights-bearing individual. Neither of these pieces of legislation discusses the need for minimum wages, or the need for an easy and accessible grievance redressal mechanism against abuse, exploitation and violence.

In 2011, the then Ministry of Labour and Employment released the first ‘National Policy for Domestic Workers’. However, this was held up in a Parliamentary Standing Committee and was ultimately retracted by the Ministry. In the same year, India <a href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C189">signed</a> the ‘Domestic Workers Convention, C189’ of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Article 5 of the Convention states – “Each Member shall take measures to ensure that domestic workers enjoy effective protection against all forms of abuse, harassment and violence.” Apart from this, the Convention aims to grant certain basic rights to domestic workers, such as fair wages, regulated working hours, equal bargaining power, access to grievance redressal mechanisms, social security and most importantly, a dignified and recognized employment identity. Unfortunately, India has not ratified this Convention to date, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-doesnt-ratify-ilo-convention-on-domestic-workers-bandaru-dattatreya/articleshow/46610697.cms?from=mdr">stating</a> reasons that the national laws and practices in India are not in conformity with the provisions of the Convention. It is interesting to note that close to a decade after the Convention was adopted, only 29 UN member states have ratified it.

Subsequently, there have been multiple efforts to pass a National Policy. In 2016, Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament, <a href="http://164.100.47.4/billstexts/lsbilltexts/asintroduced/1573.pdf">introduced</a> the Domestic Workers’ Welfare Bill in Parliament as a private member’s bill. In 2017, the National Platform for Domestic Workers - an association of multiple domestic workers’ unions - <a href="http://www.nirmana.org/Documents/Domestic Workers Regulation of Work and Social Security Bill-2017.pdf">released</a> the Domestic Workers Regulation of Work and Social Security Bill. Both of these bills were comprehensive in guaranteeing the necessary rights and securities to domestic workers. Needless to say, neither of them has seen the light of day.

Finally in 2019, the Government announced that a <a href="https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1558848">draft</a> National Policy on Domestic Workers was under consideration. This policy seems to show some promise in recognizing the domestic work profession and affording certain basic rights to these workers. According to its stated objectives, domestic workers will be ensured the right to minimum wages, protection from exploitation and access to appropriate redressal mechanisms, among other things. While this was announced in June 2019, it is not clear when the Policy will actually be turned into full-fledged legislation. There has also been no word from the Central Government regarding the policy since.

The issue being raised here is not a new one. Successive governments have kept deferring the task of passing strong legislation for the rights of domestic workers for too long. If it was handled effectively earlier, then probably this first-of-its-kind lockdown being witnessed today would have been a lot easier for domestic workers across the country.

As preliminary <a href="https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/govt-helpline-receives-92000-calls-on-abuse-and-violence-in-11-days/articleshow/75044722.cms">reports</a> already suggest, a surge in domestic violence complaints at the end of the lockdown seems inevitable. A lot of such complaints of violence, abuse and harassment may also want to be lodged by domestic workers against their employers. However, their efforts in doing so will be hindered by the lack of any efficient legislation equipping them to systematically seek redressal for their grievances.

Regardless of the time lost, this lockdown must act as a reminder, and serve the important purpose of prompting the government to take this matter up with utmost urgency. Effective permanent legislation must be rolled out at the earliest opportunity. This will help cement the identities of domestic workers as rights-bearing individuals, and uphold the dignity of their services, leading to their true emancipation in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world is grappling with the growing terror of the novel coronavirus, millions of people have started to work from home to rescue themselves from the pitfalls of this pandemic. However, many people are not able to relish in the ease and comfort of the house during such extremities. With social distancing, lockdown, and home quarantine measures being implemented across the country, the corona-warriors (medical and police personnel) are working relentlessly to keep society functioning.

<strong>Need and Liability of the Government to Protect Corona-Warriors </strong>

The government exists to protect citizens from internal and external perils whilst balancing their needs and wants. Maintaining peace, harmony, law, and order is the primary duty of the state, which is achieved through various law enforcement agencies and organizations.

Amidst crisis, there has been a substantial increase in the cases of violence, assault, and harassment against healthcare and law management personnel. Doctors, nurses, and other voluntary helpers are being shunned and ostracized from the society on the belief that as they have been treating COVID-19 patients, there is a high possibility that they are themselves infected by the virus. This is a glaring example of a situation where one is reprimanded even for doing a noble job at the cost of one’s life.

With the cases of attacks increasing, many healthcare workers may feel that their lives are threatened. This could hamper the efficiency of the medical staff whilst performing their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities toward the masses. While healthcare service personnel are duty-bound to serve without discrimination, the cooperation and support of the society are needed for them to perform their duties with confidence.

India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/asia/india-health-care-workers-applauded-trnd/index.html">urged</a> the population to stand in the balconies or at the door-step of their house to pay tribute and applaud the hard work, sacrifice, and will-power of all the healthcare workers and others who are working around-the-clock to provide a safe and secure environment to the country, while constantly putting themselves at risk. Hence, there exists a moral obligation on the government to ensure the well-being of the frontline workers-- to protect the protector.

<strong>New Rules and Regulations Amid Lockdown</strong>

The Union Government, while embracing a zero-tolerance policy for any act of violence against healthcare personnel, <a href="http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2020/219108.pdf">promulgated</a> the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance to modify the Epidemic Diseases Act of <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">1897</a>. Whoever abets the commission or commits harassment, hurt, intimidation, harm, and injury or puts the life of any healthcare personnel in danger, within the hospital premises or otherwise, could be punished with imprisonment varying from three months to five years, coupled with a fine of at least fifty-thousand rupees.

In cases where the violence causes grievous hurt, as defined under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/895891/">Section 320</a> of the Indian Penal Code, such person will be imprisoned for a term not less than six months, which can be extended to seven years, along with a fine ranging from one to five thousand rupees. Any such offense by any person is declared to be cognizable and non-bailable. The ordinance elucidates that investigation of the case should be concluded within thirty days by a police officer, not below the rank of an inspector.

In this scenario, where the person is prosecuted for committing an offense punishable under this act, the court shall presume the person to be guilty, until the contrary is proved. In addition to a punishment for the guilty, he will also be accountable to pay compensation to the victim for causing such danger to life. As per the ordinance, for damage to property or any loss caused, the wrong-doer has to pay twice the amount of fair market value of such destroyed property as compensation. The amount shall be recovered as an arrear of land revenue, in the circumstance of failure to pay the compensation. All the inquiries, trials, and proceedings should be conducted as speedily as possible and the case should be disposed of within one year. However, if by any chance the trial is not concluded within the said period, an extension of six months can be granted.

The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution has <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1613082#.XpDULg7jpqo.whatsapp">ratified</a> the grant of ex-gratia monetary compensation to over one-hundred-thousand workers and officers of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) including eighty thousand laborers who are working twenty-four-seven to supply food grains across the country amidst the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic. Under its provisions, during a six-month period, if anyone dies from a COVID-19 infection while on duty with FCI, there will be ex-gratia payments to the worker’s family.

The Supreme Court directed the government to take some necessary steps to protect the workers who are fighting on the frontlines. It also <a href="https://images.assettype.com/barandbench/2020-04/46f9c9b2-6bda-4545-ab98-2a3dc9268036/Jerryl_banait_vs_UOI___08_04_2020.pdf">elucidated</a> that the government is not allowed to deduct parts of Government doctors,’ salaries to procure protective equipment. Respective governments of the state have to provide sufficient police security to the medical staff in the clinical premises where COVID-19 patients are housed, as well as while they are making door-to-door visits for screenings and identification of virus-infected patients.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

While the entire world is fighting the battle against the coronavirus, the medical staff is forced to fight its own battle with other humans. Dire circumstances indisputably have terrible or dreadful consequences. Therefore, the priority of the government must be to amend the laws to be in-sync with present-day conditions. As instances of violence and assault on workers proliferate, the necessity of introducing new laws or re-drafting the existing ones becomes dire. It is time to save the savior. The ordinance was laid down to permeate the sense of safety and security in the minds of corona-warriors who are being threatened by miscreants.

		<title>Boys&#039; Locker Room: Does Indian Rape Culture Need a Better Deterrent than the Death Penalty?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em><strong>Content Warning</strong> - This piece discusses law and policy around child sexual assault.</em></blockquote>
India witnessed yet another episode of toxic masculinity and a predominant rape culture thriving with the youth of the country, and not just the illiterate or disadvantaged, but educated, young children. Yes. On Sunday, certain screenshots of a chat group on the social media platform ‘Instagram’ with the name "Boy’s Locker Room" caused mass unrest among the internet users and has now been addressed by the Delhi Police. The issue involves a chat group with young 16-18-year-old boys and girls, sharing lewd photographs of women, often morphed, resulting in gross objectification and sexualization of underage girls, roughly of 16 years of age, which became even more problematic when messages sent by certain members of the group suggested gang-rapes and other sexually violent acts against the girls. This issue has caught enough attention to attract the Delhi Commission for Women to issue a notice to the Delhi Police and Instagram. This has sparked a very indispensable conversation about the rape culture that permeates within the society. This also forces people to reconsider the entire debate of the validity of the death penalty in rape cases and its effect on society. Moreover, a rather interesting perspective that has also evolved with the debate is society's reaction to the behavior that has been shown by the children here in conflict with the law, since they are juveniles. The prospective application of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/7610219/">Section 74</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act) 2015 has also been raised.

<strong>Distribution of Objectionable Photographs of Minors</strong>

Can the distribution of morphed objectionable photographs of minors be defined as "child sexual abuse" and be treated the same as child pornography? The Indian Criminal Law has termed the circulation of such objectionable photos as crime, under the <a href="https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/protectionbill_0.pdf">POCSO</a> Act. Section 11(v) penalizes anyone who threatens to use, in any form of media real of fabricated depiction through electronic, film or digital or any other mode, of any part of the body of the child or the involvement of the child in a sexual act. Moreover, Section 13 of Chapter III of the act also penalizes whoever uses a child in any form of media (including...over the internet...) for sexual gratification.

The act of sexual harassment in the form of photographs or the form of child pornography has been <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1999/3/A2000-21.pdf">criminalized</a> under the Information Technology Act, 2000, with Section 67B of the act criminalizing the publishing and the circulation of material with depictions of children in explicit sexual acts. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 also criminalizes the possession and circulation of the obscene material. Now the question remains whether a juvenile accused of the act can be tried under POCSO Act? A recent trend has seen courts take affirmative stance on the issue, where the juveniles have been <a href="http://&lt;https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/in-a-first-hyderabad-juvenile-sentenced-to-double-life-imprisonment/1563578&gt;">sentenced</a> under the POCSO act. This significantly raises stakes over the issue.

<strong>The Persistence of a Rape Culture</strong>

There is no denying that the acts committed by the members of the Boys Locker Group are wrong. Legal and moral magnitudes have mandated different stances on the issue and have further surfaced the arguments that do not just create this culture but also help it thrive. One such argument that has been made is that these acts are not anything unique, and everyone has a locker room. This is a modest version of the cacophony Men’s Rights Activists often associate themselves with. Diluting sexual misconduct and sexual remarks as regular locker room talk is extremely problematic. The other argument that even women objectify men is just the foreshadowing of the “asking for it” argument. If you think about it, the act of objectification became problematic with the dilution of the entire female identity into just bodily characteristics. The value of a woman’s existence when brought down to physical attributes reduces a woman’s existential importance to the man’s approval of their existential utility, hence, the word objectification. The other set of arguments try to build a case for those juveniles accused of these acts is that they have yet not committed any act which should hold them liable for anything. Frankly, the word ‘yet’ seems to answer this question a little louder than we expect. So will this culture be solved by the deterrence offered by the law in cases of rape?

<strong>The Death Penalty has Uncertain Effects</strong>

The death penalty has been a very contentious issue throughout the history of modern legal consciousness. The debate has been observed in classic cases like <span style="text-decoration: underline">Mithu v. State of Punjab</span> where the mandatory death penalty was <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/791358/">termed</a> unconstitutional. This case laid down a foundational understanding of the concepts of constitutionalism concerning the state protecting the lives of the people and the use of mandatory death penalty provisions. With time multiple pieces of legislation have mandated death penalties. There has been no decision by the Apex Court striking the laws down. This also needs to be seen with the understanding that <span style="text-decoration: underline">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</span> <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/307021/">provides</a>, wherein the court lists the entire process of capital punishment which is restricted to the rarest cases. Most importantly, Justice Bhagwati’s dissenting judgment became a pioneer for anti-death penalty arguments, which find the inspiration in his words to call the death penalty inherently arbitrary and a crime against humanity.

The hanging of the Nirbhaya Rape Convicts and the killing of the 2019 Hyderabad Gang-Rape Accused gathered a lot of praise and appreciation. It is natural for society to crave revenge and retribution for the heinous acts that have been committed. One such major change can be observed in the punishments for aggravated rape cases.
<blockquote>“(i) A rapist who during the crime causes the death of the victim or causes the victim to be left in a “persistent vegetative state” shall be punished by death under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013.
(ii) Following the Nirbhaya Gang Rape case in 2012, repeated gang rapes were also held to be punishable by death under Section 9 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013.
(iii) The rape of an 8-year-old Kashmiri girl i.e. Asifa Bano case caused the amendment in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018 which said that the death penalty may be imposed for the rape of girls under 12 years of age, and the minimum punishment is 20 years in prison, along with a fine.”</blockquote>
But the question now remains: do these provisions and the decisions, either by the court or the public appreciation of Hyderabad encounters, solve any problem whatsoever? The 262nd Law Commission Report has already asked for abolishment of Death Penalty for almost all of the above-mentioned crimes, and to restrict it solely to crimes of terrorism. The understanding that these death penalties do not deter the idea of rape but make the crime even more heinous in most of the cases is catching traction.

<strong>Disclosure of the Names of Children in Conflict with Law</strong>

Last, but not least, there is the issue of sharing the screenshots. Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children Act) 2015 clearly states that,
<blockquote>“74. (1) No report in any newspaper, magazine, news-sheet or audio-visual media or other forms of communication regarding any inquiry or investigation or judicial procedure, shall disclose the name, address or school or any other particular, which may lead to the identification of a child in conflict with the law or a child in need of care and protection or a child victim or witness of a crime, involved in such matter, under any other law for the time being in force, nor shall the picture of any such child be published.”</blockquote>
This clearly <a href="https://blog.ipleaders.in/death-penalty/">states</a> the stance of the law regarding the circulation of the names of the accused on the screenshots carelessly, without much care about the law or the objective of the law behind this section.

<strong>Recommendation</strong>

Is breaching section 74 the only way to directly attack rape culture? The fact that many of the students, who were girls jumped to the defense of their friends should not be seen as a pacifying factor in this storm. These female members of the group are also part of the problem. The fact that the chats and the private conversations of such gruesome nature have been publicly revealed is probably causing more deterrence than the idea of capital punishment. And, probably the shaming might shift from the victim to the perpetrator. Or, should we stop and ask ourselves why there is a group of 14, 16 and 18-year-olds who find it okay to have such degrading conversations about women, especially in a time when the issues of women rights and safety are being discussed everywhere. This should also be seen with the issues of rising domestic violence cases, an exponential increase in the number of people screening pornographic videos and even searching for child pornography.

A society should most certainly look into the issue of sex education as a solution, without giving a pass to the perpetrators of such crimes. But probably what is more important is that every time a woman stands up for her story, and reports any such incident, the story is taken seriously. I recognize that I as a man am less likely to face these circumstances and I welcome feedback from those who face this firsthand everyday who are far more qualified than I to speak.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em>This article is adapted from "<a href="https://lookingbeyondwithmichaelsikand.fireside.fm/">Our Future</a>: Looking Beyond with Michael Sikand", a podcast for young leaders that explores the key questions driving the future of business, technology, and policy.</em>

<em>In “Episode 1: The Future of I.D.”, Susan Dworak, Founder and CEO of Real Identities, discusses how her company has changed the way businesses and governments verify I.D.s and shares her thoughts on the future of identity. Listen to the full interview <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-964562211/futureofidentity">here</a>.</em></blockquote>
When we consider how deeply technology has touched our everyday lives, it is surprising to think that it has not yet changed how we prove who we are. In an age where we unlock our smartphones with the press of a thumbprint or the flash of our face, we still use pieces of plastic with our picture on them to buy alcohol, board an airplane, or pick up a prescription.

While technology may very well make I.D. cards obsolete in the near future, Susan Dworak, founder and CEO of Real Identities, is determined to use technology to make our present identification system more secure. Her company has disrupted the way sprawling government agencies and large Fortune 500 companies verify driver’s licenses and I.D. cards. Discussing her company's approach, Susan says:
<blockquote>“We built an app called ID.Training that helps people tell the difference between a real I.D. and a fake I.D., helping them comply with really complex laws related to identification. With nearly 1000 valid versions of I.D. in the United States. There's no way your waiter or anybody can keep them all straight. We put them all together in one app.”</blockquote>
Dworak continues, “You present your I.D., the waiter taps on the state, taps on the version, and instantly gets access to a visual side-by-side of the real I.D. and a fake I.D.”

Fake I.D.s are notoriously easy to manufacture, with the materials used to make them by state agencies being commercially available in many cases. It has become increasingly popular for underage adults to purchase Fake I.D.s through online websites that accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and encourage group-level ordering for discounts. In fact, some Chinese-based forgers boast over 10,000 orders a day for fake identification cards.

Its important to note that when people think about Fake I.D.s, they think of booze being bought for frat parties or cigarettes sold to youngsters at bodegas. The reality is however, that the easily forged nature of physical I.D. cards enable crimes on a much higher level than underage drinking.

“Terrorism, human trafficking, domestic violence. There are a lot of really serious crimes that happen around this country and all over the world by the use of fake I.D.s that could not happen without them.” Dworak said. “The Las Vegas shooter, the Oklahoma City bomber, the 9/11 terrorists, all of those crimes were committed with the use of fake I.D.”

Despite the inadequacies of current identification forms, innovation promises new ways in which to more securely verify identity. Some states have greenlit testing for mobile driver's licenses, which would see people reach for their smartphones instead of wallets when asked by a bartender or airline representative to provide proof of identity. Their digital nature, however, makes them even more susceptible to forgery and manipulation, a risk which has slowed their introduction and limited current applications to only internal use at a few government agencies.

The most highly-anticipated identity innovations, however, lie under the futuristic umbrella of biometrics. Take for example how CLEAR machines in airports have built-in sensors to collect both thumbprint and iris scans. Each human’s unique biological characteristics allows for a much more secure level of identification, especially when multiple indicators are combined.

“For example, you might get your phone. Use your fingerprint to open your phone. You go to your banking app and the bank recognizes your face and they say, 'okay, now speak.' They want to combine facial recognition with voice recognition.” Dworak said. “We're also looking at biometrics like walking. You can actually identify somebody by their gait.”

While biometrics have a much lower margin of error in proving identity than plastic cards, and can also provide higher levels of verification speed and convenience when travelling through an airport or entering a sports stadium, privacy concerns are also key to the conversation.

In a world where data is the currency above all else, allowing companies and governments to collect your biological signatures could be considered somewhat troubling. Further, the perceived “foolproof” nature of this technology could make for tough court cases when individuals have their biometric data hacked and used maliciously.

“Everything is hackable and fingerprints can be hacked. Irises can be hacked. Interestingly, retinas are the only things that have not been hacked. Giving up security for convenience is a really dangerous proposition,” Dworak said.

While a world where goods and services are accessed through retinal scans and gestural identification is far off in the future, its not hard to imagine how such systems could drastically reduce identity-related crimes. Nevertheless, it's fascinating to see companies like Real Identities use technology to fix the flaws inherent to the status quo.

		<title>Conflict Between the Right to Privacy and the Right to Public Health: Global Phenomenon and Coronavirus Outbreak</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The novel coronavirus pandemic is not only causing tens of thousands of deaths worldwide, damaging economies and disrupting normal lifestyles of people, but it is also posing several legal challenges. One such challenge is the right to privacy vs. the right to public health. Aggressive and intrusive contact-tracing mechanisms of governments worldwide during this acute public health emergency are causing certain privacy concerns among civil liberties defenders. It has been argued that we simply can’t defend privacy while public health is tailspinning, but privacy and public health do not have to be incommensurable goals. Assertive containment strategies do not require governments to be completely ignorant of other rights, nor do they require any kind of epidemiological inaction for the sake of informational and associational privacy of individuals.

The collection and sharing of biomedical data is sine qua non for containing the infectious diseases in order to identify point of contact. The pandemic has further escalated the need for collecting and sharing data, as well as for tracking people’s movements. For instance, China’s government used CCTV footage to retrace interactions among disease carriers. Alipay Health Code System in China automatically assigns each user a color-coded infectious threat level. South Korea used credit card transactions as information for the same. The Israeli government <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-13/there-no-devils-bargain-between-privacy-and-public-health">disclosed</a> the existence of a large cache of cellphone data to track the movements and social contacts of infected persons. This aggressive digital surveillance has been justified by governments worldwide in the name of public health crises during the pandemic. European countries where data is protected by General Data Protection Regulation have sought to <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/coronavirus-v-gdpr-suspending-data-85584/">suspend</a> some regulations, taking into account Article 9 (2)(1)of GDPR, which allows for data processing when necessary in public interest, such as serious cross-border health threats.

However, despite such exceptions, strict regulations for data protection should not be blatantly suspended or ignored. There ought to be balance, especially when privacy rights have received spectacular national and international recognition. This becomes even more important when institutionalization of biosurveillance technologies leads to biomedical data, which is sensitive data, being factored into routine government screening and monitoring. Tech companies and certain private players can chase this untapped resource if it is not properly regulated. Also, there is no clue as to what happens to the data and the whole surveillance mechanism once the emergency ends. The way that privacy rights are dealt with will create a lasting impact on the way that privacy is perceived in future. Thus, a robust regime of surveillance is necessary, requiring stringent procedures to keep this information safe and to delete it when no longer in use. A government’s transparency and an engaged society are all very important to <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-04-13/there-no-devils-bargain-between-privacy-and-public-health">fight</a> this pandemic.

A fear of misuse or of a privacy breach is not peculiar to this pandemic. China has been <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-04-06/coronavirus-and-future-surveillance">building</a> a digital authoritarian surveillance state from pre-pandemic times. China and the U.S. have been doing so on the international stage, to <a href="http://globalcommitteefortheruleoflaw.org/the-digital-dictators-how-technology-strengthens-autocracy/">determine</a> global standards and to shape key network infrastructure, exporting 5G technology and the Orwellian system of facial recognition abroad. Recently, Microsoft too <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/04/23/microsoft-embraces-big-data">planned</a> to launch 20 data sharing groups by 2022 and give away some of its digital information, including data collected on COVID-19.The <span>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a </span>group of mostly rich countries, reckons that if data collected through different mediums would be more widely exchanged, many countries could enjoy gains worth between 1% and 2.5% of GDP.

<b>Privacy in India</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What is worth noticing in today’s digitally advanced world, with the ever-increasing use of artificial intelligence, is that these problems are not limited to just rich and advanced economies. Multilateralism and globalization resulted in an interconnected world and the further sharing of these modern-age problems. The situation in India is no different regarding privacy concerns and the way the government is handling the recent crisis. Custom apps have been developed to enable tracking and to keep people aware about recent updates. Mobile phone companies are being asked to have subscriber geotracking data. However,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">many states have no statutes clearly addressing nondisclosure of personally identifiable health information generally held by public health agencies, and no statutes  regarding disclosure under exceptional circumstances.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court expressed concerns on the data of COVID-19 patients uploaded on the server of Sprinklr, a U.S. based data analytics firm. The Division Bench asked the state government to file a statement regarding data security and the contract between government and the company on data sharing by the law department.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The government finds legitimacy through statutes such as National <a href="https://ndma.gov.in/en/disaster.html">Disaster Management</a> Act; <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1445510/">Section 5(2)</a> of The Indian Telegraph Act (1885), which allows lawful interception of phones and computers; and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1439440/">Section 69</a> of Information Technology Act (2000), which deals with interception, monitoring and decryption of information. However, in the Puttaswamy Case, where the right to privacy was declared a fundamental right, the Supreme Court laid down a certain proportionality test and identified nine privacy principles pertaining to notice: choice and consent, collection limitation, purpose limitation, access and correction, non-disclosure of information, security of knowledge, openness or proportionality on the size, scope and sensitivity of information collected. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Reasonable restriction in the current situation seems justified. However, once the crisis ends, we need to be extra careful with the collected data and how it is treated later, since the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">right to privacy <a href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/privacy-in-healthcare-policy-guide">embodies</a> the </span>right to be forgotten. P<span style="font-weight: 400">atients can request that their data is deleted after they have been discharged, or after the clinical trial has been concluded. In the Indian scenario, patient information is kept for extended periods of time. This can be subject to unauthorized access and misuse. The deletion of patient information once it has been used for the purpose for which it was collected is thus imperative for the creation of an environment of privacy protection.</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Though we see a kind of relaxation on certain privacy clauses worldwide, making space for geofencing, tracking and surveillance to contain the spread of infection, these reserve surveillance forces should be made democratically accountable under legislation that follows a parliamentary discussion on proportionality. Violations in the healthcare sector that stem from policy formulation and implementation gaps include the disclosure of personal health information to third parties without consent; unlimited or unnecessary collection of personal health data; provision of personal health data given for research; and commercial uses without de-identification of data and improper security standards, storage and disposal. It may <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-surveillance-tracking-privacy.html">result</a> in a certain kind of discrimination or stigmatization.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thus, we need sound policies and special data protection legislation for sensitive data protection, especially in a country like India, where privacy is comparatively a newer concept. The authorities responsible for data collection during this pandemic and later should seek to process location data in an anonymous way to prevent individual identification. It also becomes the responsibility of the state to play an active role in collaborative efforts between public and private stakeholders to create a protective framework. This would allow such healthcare measures without completely shattering the existence of privacy rights of the individual, which emanate from the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">right</a> to life and liberty.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The aim of "combination regulation" is to inquire whether a transaction can cause an adverse effect on competition, and to prevent or modify such anti-competitive combination before consummation of the transaction. The jurisdictional threshold of turnover and asset has been <a href="https://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MWG_NPRecPractices2018.pdf">considered</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> as an effective tool for merger regulation. However, the escape of a few high-profile cases from the review - such as Microsoft-LinkedIn, Facebook-WhatsApp, and Flipkart-Myntra - has raised concerns for authorities regarding an apparent enforcement gap, which has been attributed to the advent of digitalization. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Digital platforms, marked by network effects and high economies of scale, operate with a business strategy that focuses on increasing their user-base by offering free or low-cost services. It does not translate into significant revenue or asset base. However, due to the degree of innovation, technical know-how, and access to data, these platforms are valued significantly. The transactions that escaped the merger review, on account of the target not generating requisite turnover or holding a sufficient asset base, showcased the obvious enforcement gap necessitating the introduction of a new threshold. The Competition Law Review Committee (CLRC) <a href="http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/ReportCLRC_14082019.pdf">suggested</a> in its </span><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">inter alia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, inclusion of a deal-value threshold, in addition to the current turnover and asset threshold, as a prerequisite for notifiability. Accordingly, the draft Competition Amendment Bill, 2020 introduced an enabling provision under Section 5 of the </span><a href="https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/cci_pdf/competitionact2012.pdf">Competition Act</a>, 2002 (the Act) that empowers the central government to introduce necessary thresholds. Since the g<span style="font-weight: 400">overnment is most likely to <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/cci-set-to-get-more-teeth-to-regulate-tech-giants-m-as-11578851894437.html">introduce</a> a transaction value-based threshold,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> let us analyse the challenges that surround it and which of these are, if at all, addressed by the current enforcement toolbox.</span>

<b>1. Challenges with the Deal-Value Threshold </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A growing number of jurisdictions, such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Germany, Austria,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sweden, and the EU, have considered or <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Publikation/EN/Leitfaden/Leitfaden_Transaktionsschwelle.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">adopted</a> a transaction-size threshold, either in replacement of or as a complement to traditional thresholds. However, the implementation of deal-value criteria comes with a set of its own issues, given the dynamics of the digital market that it aims to monitor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">First, the deal-value threshold is subjective in a sense that the valuation of a target firm varies from one acquirer to the other. Also, it cannot accurately gauge the competitive significance of a transaction. It is not inconceivable that a potential start-up can be bought out for a low value, and the resultant merged entity can subsequently disrupt the market. Moreover, determining the actual value of a transaction is challenging and involves several factors, such as variation of the purchase price across sectors; fluctuation of the share prices between the announcement and completion of the transaction; different valuation methods; and deferred consideration. Take, for example, the Facebook-WhatsApp <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032515/whatsapp-best-facebook-purchase-ever.asp">deal</a>,<span style="font-weight: 400"> where the initial offer in February 2014 was 19 billion USD. By completion of the deal in October 2014, however, the price had risen to 22 billion USD as a result of the rise in the value of Facebook’s shares (tendered as part consideration).</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Second, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">recommended practices</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the International Competition Network (ICN) <a href="https://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MWG_NPRecPractices2018.pdf">requires</a> merger notification thresholds to be clear, understandable, and based on objectively quantifiable criteria. The deal-value threshold attaches with itself a certain vagueness (as illustrated above), thus reducing efficiency and legal certainty of the merger review. Lack of clarity in the procedural aspect of the threshold would result in unnecessary reviewing of multiple false- positive cases, ultimately burdening the docket of the authorities. Although the CLRC’s report ratifies the ICN recommendations, it does not say anything about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">inculcate these criteria in the new threshold’s framework. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Third, the digital market is at its budding stage in India, where the cash-strapped start-ups usually need investment from the established market players to flourish. Inclusion of the deal-value threshold can expose the start-ups to prolonged procedures for competitive approval where the start-ups, as a result, lose their competitive edge. Complicating the process can further disincentivize the investors. Competition Commission of India (CCI), in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Flipkart case,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> explicitly <a href="https://www.cci.gov.in/sites/default/files/20-of-2018.pdf">observed</a> that the digital marketplaces in India are at a relatively nascent stage and that “any intervention in such markets needs to be carefully crafted lest it stifles innovation.” Hence, over-legislating at this stage can lead to a chilling effect on both innovation and competition. The CLRC, in its report, had completely overlooked this aspect of the Indian start-up industry, whilst taking into account the competition jurisprudence of developed countries such as Germany, the UK, and the US.</span>

<b>2. Current Enforcement Toolbox</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The CLRC’s report predominantly factors in the observations made by the other competition jurisdictions with regards to the deal-value threshold. However, it does not explore India’s competition jurisprudence. Section 20 of the Act confers power on CCI to take </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">suo moto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> cognisance of a combination which causes or threatens to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition. Moreover, under section 6 of the Act, CCI has the power to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">subsequently </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">render the transaction void if it causes an adverse effect on competition. Given that the Act confers wide powers on CCI, allowing it to take </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">suo moto </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">cognisance of the data-driven combinations, there is scarcely the need to introduce a new threshold. </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With the growing digital market, Indian competition jurisprudence needs to strike balance between both incentives to innovate and stricter scrutiny to not allow it to threaten the competition and consumer welfare. However, inclusion of the obscure deal-value threshold to fill an enforcement gap, without any further proper guidance, shall hinder the objectives of competition law. CLRC’s advice, without any empirical study in the Indian context, also raises multiple questions on the need for additional jurisdictional thresholds. Ultimately, the competition authorities should aim at minimizing the administrative burden by reducing the transactions that are notified to the authorities without allowing the potential transactions, which raise concern, to fall outside the merger review.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><em><strong>Content Warning</strong> - This piece discusses law and policy around child sexual assault. </em></blockquote>
The Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (<a href="https://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/POCSO%20Act%2C%202012.pdf">POCSO</a>) came into force on November 14, 2012, and was specifically formulated to deal with offences including child sexual abuse and child pornography. The Act through its 46 provisions increased the scope of reporting offences against children, which were not earlier covered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). This expanded the criminal penalty for aggravated penetrative sexual assault to include punishment for abuse by a person in position of trust or authority including public servants, police, armed forces, and management or staff of an educational or religious institution.

It also defined the procedure for reporting cases, including a provision for punishment for failure to report a case or false complaint. It provided procedures for recording of the statement of a child by the police and court, specifically requiring that it should be done in a child-friendly manner, and by the establishing special courts.

The POCSO Act defines offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment, pornography and safeguarding the interest and well-being of children. It also sets out a child-friendly procedure regarding the recording of evidence, investigation and trial of offences, establishment of special courts and speedy trial of cases. The aim of the act is to provide protection to the child at every stage of judicial process.

<strong>I. Features of POCSO:</strong>

POCSO is gender neutral, meaning that crimes of this nature committed against children will be handled by this act regardless of the gender of the child. This Act sets a burden of proof of "guilty until proven innocent" rather than the general rule of "innocent until proven guilty." Simultaneously, in order to prevent misuse of the law, the law contains punishments for false complaints and false information with malicious intent. The recording of abuse is mandatory under this Act. It is mandatory for the police to register a First Information Report (FIR) in all cases of child abuse. A child’s statement can be recorded at the child’s residence or a place of their choice and should be preferably done by a female police officer not below the rank of sub-inspector. This act lists all possible sexual offences against children including various types of sexual assault, sexual harassment, use of minors for pornographic purposes. The Act additionally prescribes punishments for attempted crimes under this act as well as aiding-and-abetting these crimes or failure to report these crimes. If there is any suspicion that an offence should be reported, the Act advises reporting because failure to report alone may result in up to 6 months of imprisonment and/or fines.

The Act also prescribes for special courts to be created to handle these trials, each of which should be completed within one year. The Act requires that the minor is not exposed in any way to the accused during the recording of evidence and their identity is not disclosed at any time during the investigation or trial. The minor is not made to repeat their testimony in court, and they may give the testimony using a video stream instead. The defense asks all questions through the judge and is not allowed to ask them in an aggressive manner. An interpreter, translator, special educator or any other expert may be present in court for the minor’s assistance. There is also defined criteria for awarding compensation by the Special Court which includes: loss of educational and employment opportunities along with disability, disease or pregnancy as the consequence of the abuse.

The POCSO Act has also changed consensual sex under the Indian Penal Code. The age of consent has been raised from 16 years of age to 18 years of age. This means that any person (including a child) can be prosecuted for engaging in a sexual act with a child irrespective of whether the latter consented. Additionally, A husband/wife can be prosecuted for engaging in a sexual act with their spouse under 18 years of age. The POCSO Act, 2012 does not recognize consensual sexual acts among children or between a child and an adult.

<strong>II. Loopholes in the Act</strong>

Upon a preliminary reading the POCSO Act may qualify as the ideal legislation to protect children from sexual offences. However, there are certain conceptual problems in it.

The Act does not leave any possibility of consent given by persons under 18. This would mean that if a seventeen year old boy or girl had a nineteen year old sexual partner, the partner would be liable to be booked under the provisions of the POCSO Act. The Act also does not provide any clarity on what happens when two minors engage in any kind of sexual activity. Technically, they are both Children in Need of Care and Protection (CNCP) and Children in Conflict with Law (CCLs). In practice though, the police declare girls to be CNCPs and the boys to be CCLs.

Another problem faced by victims is proving the age of the child. Since the POCSO Act is silent on what documents are to be considered for determining the age of the child victim, the provisions of Rule 12 of the Juvenile Justice Rules have been read by Courts as applying to child victims as well. This rule recognizes only the birth certificate, the school certificate of the child, or the matriculation certificate. However, children who are only able to produce other documents – even a legal document such as a passport – have to undergo a bone ossification test. This test can give a rough estimate of the age of the child at best. There needs to be a clear provision in the POCSO Act that lays down what documents should be considered for proving the age of the child, and whether the benefit of the doubt should be given to the child if the ossification test cannot provide an exact assessment.

Similar to the law of rape under the IPC. The pronoun used for the accused is “he”, thus, again, only a male can be booked for the offences under the relevant provisions of the POCSO Act. Though, unlike rape, a victim under the POCSO Act can be any child irrespective of the gender, the accused still can only be a male and females are again given a protective shield, for reasons unknown. Saying that females do not subject children to forceful sexual assault is untrue.

These are clear examples of the unexplained gender bias in the laws relating to sexual intercourse in India. Also, since the POCSO Act only looks into the age aspect, a teenage girl below the age of 18 who experiences coercive sexual assault may later have the boy booked under the IPC. But, vice-versa won’t be true due to the biased definition. A woman who commits a like offence can be booked only for sexual assault under the POCSO Act, the punishment therein being much less compared to sexual assault under the IPC.

<strong>Pitfalls in Judiciary and Delivery of Justice:</strong>

One of the cornerstones of the POCSO Act is its mechanism to provide speedy justice to children who are victims of sexual assault. However, many serious institutional bottlenecks affect the legal protection of children below the age of 18 years.

An obvious example is the timeline for child testimony and conclusion of the trial laid down in Section 35 of the POCSO Act. This requires the child testimony to take place within a month of cognizance by the Court, and the trial within a year of the same. However, these provisions are more often flouted than complied with due to the overburdened nature of courts in India.

A related issue is the tendency of the lawyer’s to take adjournments, or adjournments caused due to external factors such as strikes in Court. In such situations, the victim ends up getting called repeatedly to court, or the hearing can be delayed as much as six or seven months after the incident is reported. This reduces the chances of the victim being able to recollect the facts of the incident accurately.

Interim compensation is another important issue. The child victim is entitled to interim compensation to meet their immediate needs. However, it is necessary for all stakeholders to understand that interim compensation should not be restrictively interpreted to mean only his or her medical needs. It includes every need of the child necessary for rehabilitation.

Under Section 33(2) of the POCSO Act, the Special Public Prosecutor while recording the examination-in-chief, cross-examination or re-examination of the child, should first communicate the questions to the Special Court and then those questions should be put to the child. The child should also be given frequent breaks between questions.

The role of the lawyer for the child is also pivotal. The mandate of the lawyer is to assist the prosecution. This will require proper coordination between the Pubic Prosecutor and the child’s lawyer. Further, in our adversarial justice system, while the Public Prosecutor and defense lawyer have well-defined roles, there needs to be an examination of how the lawyer for the child victim fits into this scheme.

<strong>Administrative Pitfalls:</strong>

There are three main administrative pitfalls when it comes to POCSO.

Firstly, despite their best efforts, the police face a lot of barriers in conducting a proper investigation in POCSO cases. It begins with the registration of the FIR. The police must ensure that there is no delay in the registration of the FIR, and the conducting of the Medico-Legal Case (MLC).

Secondly, the MLC of the victim is often not conducted because the victim’s family is given inaccurate information on the long term ill-effect of the MLC on the child’s health. When the child has to go for an MLC or an abortion, he or she often faces a hostile atmosphere in the hospital. Doctors therefore need to be educated on how to communicate with the child with sensitivity about what he or she is going through to prevent further trauma. Furthermore, the forensic samples taken by the police often end up getting contaminated, or putrefied due to improper storage. The police need to be acquainted with the best methods of collecting forensic evidence, so that the appreciation of the evidence can take place smoothly during the trial.

Finally, under Section 43-44 and Rule 6 of POCSO Act institutions such as the National and State Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights are required to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Act on a regular basis in addition to generating public awareness to the provisions of the Act. However, the functioning of such departments and their monitoring and evaluation procedures have not been open to public scrutiny. To this extent, it is imperative to study the procedures established by such bodies and evaluate their effectiveness in generating impactful outcomes.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The present legislation for criminalizing sexual offences against children was a much-needed piece of legislation. The adjudication process for the same should be made more transparent and the role of police in such offences much more prompt, so that people sense a feeling of contention and credibility in the whole process from initiation to adjudication. The deterrent effect which this act renders is also sufficient, but to overcome and eradicate this issue from the grassroots level, the collective consciousness among the masses should be pure and must include the feelings of love and care.

		<title>Congress Reincarnates Discrimination Against American Citizens Because of Who They Marry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1907, Congress <a href="https://calvo.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2016/10/02/gender-wives-and-u-s-citizenship-status/">passed</a> a law that punished US citizen women for marrying “foreigners.” In March of 1931, Congress rejected this discrimination. But in March of 2020, Congress reincarnated it by passing a law that punishes both US citizen men and women who are married to non-citizens. The March 2020 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748">CARES Act</a> was designed to help support American families during the coronavirus crisis by providing payment through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). But it punishes US citizens because they have non-citizen spouses, even when they have correctly filed income tax forms. This gives new life to the legally rejected historical animosity against US citizens who married non-citizens. This reversion conflicts with modern law that recognizes the agency and authority of married women and men, respects an individual's choice about marriage, and supports a fundamental right to family. Further, it undermines American citizens’ statutory right to request that their non-citizen spouses live with them in the United States.

The CARES Act denies stimulus checks to US citizens who have filed their income tax forms with their social security numbers and the Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN) of their non-citizen spouses. Other citizens who filed their joint family tax returns for 2018 and or 2019 are eligible to receive desperately needed aid to support their families during the coronavirus crisis.

The CARES Act reverts back to the prior century’s hostility to citizens, particularly women, who married non-citizens. In 1915, the US Supreme Court in Mackenzie v. Hare <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/239/299/">upheld</a> the constitutionality of the 1907 law that resulted in the involuntary loss of a woman’s US citizenship if she married a “foreigner." Ethel Mackenzie was a life-long resident of California married to a British citizen living with her in California. She lost her citizenship because of her marriage when she attempted to fulfill another civic responsibility: voting. The 1907 law was grounded in the concept of coverture that removed a married women’s rights on the premise that she was subordinate to and controlled by her “foreign” husband. In 1931, Congress rejected punishment against citizens married to non-citizens by passing a law that prevented the loss of citizenship through marriage to a “foreigner." Married women, as well as men, were then legally respected as persons with agency and authority in their choice of spouses and family life.

Further, in 1965, Congress established family unity as a predominant basis for migration. The legislation rejected prior discriminatory criteria based on nationality, race, and gender. It afforded a statutory right to US citizens wishing to live in the US with their non-citizen immediate relatives, including spouses. The right to family unity as a spouse belongs to the US citizen. The citizen must file a petition for her spouse, and only if that petition is approved may the non-citizen spouse apply for permanent residency that then allows application for a social security number. But this already lengthy process was subject to delays by the Trump administration before the coronavirus crisis and has now been blocked by the United States Citizen and Immigration Services’ (USCIS) processing suspensions.

The Migration Policy Institute <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">states</a> that over 1.2 million citizens are married to non-citizens who are not yet permanent residents. The Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2018/lawful_permanent_residents_2018.pdf">reported</a> that in 2018 about 268,000 spouses of US citizens became permanent residents. The six female and male US citizen plaintiffs in a <a href="https://www.maldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Amador-Complaint-093111051698-1.pdf">lawsuit</a> challenging this CARES Act provision have been married to their non-citizen spouses between two and six years. Additionally, each family has between one and five US citizen children.

Denying US citizens needed support in the face of a crisis because they file taxes with a spouse’s ITIN number undermines their right to marriage and family. This is especially harsh when the USCIS's reaction to the coronavirus crisis prevents citizens from moving forward in the process to obtain their spouses’ legal residencies and social security numbers.

The CARES Act reverts to an irrational hostility against Americans married to “foreigners.” It discriminates against male and female citizens even though they have made an extra effort to correctly file income taxes. Non-citizens without social security numbers are required to file and pay taxes by applying for individual taxpayer identification numbers. Citizens and their spouses who went through the trouble of obtaining an ITIN number to file taxes were doing their best to meet their civic responsibility.

It makes no sense to punish anyone for trying to correctly file income taxes. But the CARES legislation is egregious as it reestablishes an irrational antagonism to “the foreign” that historically harmed Americans because of their choice of marriage.  Such a premise was rightfully rejected almost 90 years ago. It should not have been reincarnated now.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In India, dissent has grown to become an essential right guaranteed by the constitution, and the trend shows an increase in exercising this right, which is evident from the numerous protests held each year. Contrastingly, the apex court has seen a stark decline in dissenting opinions over the years. Such a decline raises questions on the credibility and capability of the Indian Judiciary.

Immediately after the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1951, there were many dissenting opinions, the highest amount occurring from 1960-70. However, in the third decade of its existence, there was a decline in dissenting opinions, especially in cases involving the <a href="https://www.barandbench.com/columns/contribution-of-dissenting-opinions-in-constitutional-law-cases">disapproval</a> of executive action and the curtailment of constitutional rights. This decade also saw the appointments of judges that were highly politicized during the rule of the Indira Gandhi government. Though the collegium system was established by an 11 judge bench, that too <a href="https://www.epw.in/journal/2016/5/commentary/dissenting-opinions-judges-supreme-court.html">failed</a> to create qualitative changes or increases in the velocity of the dissenting opinions. The fall in dissenting opinions is a sign of an unhealthy democracy as it hinders the evolution of legal jurisprudence; however, there is no yardstick by which to measure it.

The present-day constitutional system of the two-judge Supreme Court bench has reduced the possibility of dissent in its judgments. Moreover, seniority comes into play regardless of the bench's strength. A surprising trend has also been observed over the past sixty-five years: the rate of dissent is very low when the Chief Justice of India (CJI) himself is a part of the bench, and no CJI has ever given a dissenting opinion. We shall now discuss in detail how the two-judge bench, seniority of the judge, and CJI himself being a part of the bench have affected the dissent in the judgments.

<strong>Formation of Two-Judge Bench</strong>

The Supreme Court does not sit <em>en banc</em> to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24730580.2017.1347750">decide</a> the cases brought before it. Rather, it sits in varying benches, as decided by the CJI, according to the question of law that is before it. In a two-judge bench, dissent is technically impossible as the opinion of one judge cannot be taken as superior to the other. But a question arises here: what happens when the two judges disagree with one another? Such a disagreement between the two judges is considered a dissent, but such a dissent is not usually seen in the cases for the reason herein.

When the two judges disagree with each other, their case is referred to a larger bench by the CJI for reconsideration. Disagreement, as a result, causes a burden on the Judiciary as the matter has to be considered again, leading to a fair delay in the final disposal of the case. Looking at the huge number of pending cases in India before the Judiciary, dissent is therefore impractical.

Now, considering the fact that 80% of the cases are being decided by a two-judge bench, it is clear why the rate of dissent has declined. Also, in a two-judge bench, it is more likely that the opinion of the senior-most judge will prevail over the opinion of a junior judge.

<strong>Impact of Seniority On Dissent</strong>

No matter how many judges are present on a bench, the senior-most judge always has an upper hand in influencing the decision. From 1993 to 2016, sixty-six percent of dissenting opinions in constitutional bench cases came from the two junior-most judges. The rate of dissenting opinions increases with the decrease in the seniority of the judge on the bench.

When a junior judge forms an opinion and presents it before the bench, it is likely that his opinion may not be able to supersede the opinion of the senior judge on the bench. Therefore, the opinion of a senior-most judge prevails, and a junior judge in an apprehension that his opinion might not find the support from other judges of the bench conforms with the opinion of the senior judge. Such a situation lessens the chances of dissent in the judgment. Likewise, seniority also plays a role because the Chief Justice is able to influence the bench.

<strong>Influence by the Chief Justice</strong>

As stated above, the presence of the CJI on a bench has led to lesser dissent. However, the trend shows that the rate of dissent in the presence of the CJI has been declining since independence. In the initial two decades after independence, the rate of dissent where the CJI was on the bench was around ten percent. In the next two decades, the rate of dissent dropped further to about four percent. Between 2001-2010, the rate of dissent further dropped to under three percent. Moreover, not a single dissent was recorded between 2011 and 2014. The fall in the dissent rate gives rise to a sense of disquietude.

The reason behind such a drop is unclear and is mostly attributed to the degree of control exercised by the Chief Justice towards attaining unanimity. It suggests that the cases are referred to the judges that are more likely to achieve such an end. In achieving this, a Chief Justice uses his administrative power of forming a bench where the judges present are less likely to question his judgment or may constitute a bench of like-minded judges, and therefore, dissent loses its utility. The presence of the CJI also indirectly influences the opinion of other judges as they do not tend to disagree while serving on a bench on which the Chief Justice present.

<strong>What’s at Stake?</strong>

Though dissent does not play a role in deciding the case, it has a certain role to play. That is, it’s quite possible that a dissenting opinion may be able to evolve existing jurisprudence on a subject. Dissenting opinions show the judge’s individuality and his adherence to his views. A dissent, therefore, is a valuable tool that opens the door for the evolution of law. Many times, dissenting opinions have been adopted as a majority opinion in subsequent judgments; the most famous instance being the dissenting <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/">opinion</a> of J. Fazl Ali in <u>A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</u>, which was later adopted in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/">case</a> of <u>Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</u>. The decision in the former case was overruled and dissent of Fazl Ali led to the adoption of a procedure that must be “just, fair and reasonable”.

While majority opinions lay the path for the foundation of law, dissenting opinions lay the road for its evolution. For our judicial system to flourish, differing opinions should continue to emerge that could pave the way for ever-evolving jurisprudence. A dissenting opinion puts forth the potential fallacies in the majority opinion and establishes the pressurizing argument of a devil’s advocate.

As stated above, majority judgments have been overruled by the courts after considering the dissenting opinions, their importance, therefore, can be conjectured in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/maghis/article-abstract/13/1/18/978605?redirectedFrom=fulltext">words</a> of Justice Scalia:
<blockquote>When history demonstrates that one of the Court’s decisions has been a truly horrendous mistake, it is comforting . . . to look back and realize that at least some of the Justices saw the danger clearly and gave voice, often eloquent voice, to their concern.</blockquote>
<strong>Conclusion</strong>

It may be concluded that the major factor leading to a low rate of dissent is the formation of the two-judge bench. At the same time, seniority also comes into play regardless of the bench size by influencing the opinion of other junior judges. Seniority also paves the way for a Chief Justice to influence the decision of the bench using rank, seniority and his administrative power. There are many constraints before a judge to dissent, and it is pertinent to note that any individual judge does not control these factors. But such a practice of suppressing dissent undoubtedly hits at the integrity of the fair judicial decision making.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

When the world started its global fight against the novel Coronavirus, Covid-19, immediate measures were the need of the hour. The spread of the virus was rampant. The first case of Covid-19 was reported in Wuhan, China during the month of December, 2019. Initially, China declared it to be a case of unusual pneumonia and reported the same to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, it slowly grew into an unprecedented pandemic causing havoc and taking thousands of lives. A public health emergency was declared throughout the world by the WHO and almost all countries issued various measures to tackle covid-19 in their own boundaries.

The last two months witnessed various measures taken by nations across the globe to curb the spread of this virus. The majority of them declared nationwide lockdown to hinder the spread of Covid-19 and in the meantime began to procure and deliver essentials to everyone. Curfews were enforced in many places and the United Nations (UN) through its Secretary General called for a global ceasefire. At the same time, one of the most remarkable declarations in the history of human rights and prison rights was announced. Various countries across the globe announced that they will release prisoners in order to decongest their prisons. It was suggested by experts that there is more possibility of virus spreading in places like prison as the prisoners are kept in close quarters and are in direct contact with all the working staff too. This is in complete defiance of the ‘social distancing’ which is expected to be followed to flatten the curve of patients with Covid-19.

<strong>The Conundrum of Who Should be Released?</strong>

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet explained that prisons consist of a vulnerable population who should be protected at all costs. She added that, people convicted of low-risk offences, elderly people and people with medical ailments are more vulnerable to be infected by the virus and hence their release should be treated as a priority. In Burkina Faso, President Roch Marc Christian Kabore pardoned more than 1200 prisoners to decongest prisons. According to a statement released, the freed prisoners were selected on the basis of their age, health condition and the period of sentence that they have already completed. In India, after the Supreme Court advised states to decongest the prison to hinder the rampant spread of Covid-19, high powered committees were set up to decide how this process will be implemented and they issued proper guidelines which provided detailed information about the category of prisoners that should be prioritized to be pardoned. The majority of these countries put a proper framework in place to decongest their prisons accordingly. They have prepared their framework prioritizing the release of vulnerable populations and have adhered to the prisoners' rights.

<strong>The Problem of Arbitrary Drafts and Frameworks</strong>

The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/we-are-all-together-human-rights-and-covid-19-response-and">highlighted</a> that the virus and diseases in general don’t discriminate on any grounds, as such, the provision of immediate services and benefits should not discriminate. He exclaimed that, “<em>The best response is one that responds proportionately to immediate threats while protecting human rights and the rule of law</em>.”

However, this pattern has not been followed everywhere. According to various news reports and journals, many countries are using this as an opportunity to ‘settle their scores’ with political prisoners and those who are detained for speaking or protesting against the state. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michele Bachelet’s spokesperson <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061002">mentioned</a> that prisoners who are detained without sufficient legal basis, including political prisoners and those detained for critical and dissenting views should be included in the category of prisoners to be released. He further mentioned that many countries are however not following this. He claimed that <strong><em>Iran</em></strong> has released more than 100,000 inmates but no political prisoners. A <strong><em><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/explainer-political-prisoners/24881810.html">political prisoner</a></em></strong> is loosely defined as a person who is detained owing to his or her political views, specifically against the government of their countries. According to Human Rights Watch, a few prisoners reportedly tested positive for the Coronavirus however they were not considered among those who were released, solely for the reason that they were detained for anti-government actions. News reports claim that they include political prisoners, but the government is not considering their release owing to its authoritarian approach.

In the North African country of <strong><em>Algeria</em></strong>, <a href="https://rsf.org/en/news/fake-news-bill-will-tighten-gag-press-freedom-algeria">according</a> to Reporters Without Borders, the government has been releasing various prisoners but none of them include those who are detained for affiliation with the anti-government Hirak Movement. Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s regional head <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/algeria-quash-conviction-and-sentence-against-political-leader-karim-tabbou/">proclaimed</a> that, “<em>At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has governments worldwide considering early prisoner releases, the Algerian authorities must immediately release all those imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of their rights</em>.” Similar patterns can be traced in various regions across the globe. It is disheartening that in the time of this pandemic, states are violating human rights and the rights of the prisoners detained. According to WHO and various other international statutes, people suffering from medical ailments have a right to access to health benefits and services. According to Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR), there have been deaths in prison facilities in Syria owing to the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1061002">denial</a> of medical care. <strong><em>Turkey</em></strong> is one of the most curious cases in this regard. In 2016, an attempted coup was staged against the state and failed. From then on, the state has afforded terrorist status to all who voice opposition against the state. When the Turkish Government prepared its first draft of categories of prisoners to be released, they allowed even people convicted for heinous offences like murder to be pardoned but not terrorists. The terrorists in this context majorly comprise of academics, journalists and people who were merely associated with banned anti-establishment groups. It is indeed true that some of them have actually committed violent acts and are perpetrators of crimes. However, the majority of them aren’t and were still left out of the draft. After criticism against the draft, the government removed prisoners who were convicted for murder, rape etc. but still intentionally left these academics and journalists off the list.

The problem of lack of sanitation and lack of access to medical care cannot be neglected. Many prisoners have either been reported as positive cases of Covid-19 or are suspected of having Covid-19, but these patients and potential patients are still not being provided with adequate access to medical care. This is in direct violation of the WHO guidelines which mandate prison authorities to take measures for ensuing health of the prisoners. Additionally, they should provide all prisoners, access to medical care and sufficient sanitation.

While the whole idea behind decongesting prisons was to ensure that social distancing is followed there, a new problem is on the rise. In many countries, state governments have <a href="https://thewire.in/world/prisoner-releases-across-asia-a-right-move-gone-wrong">detained</a> large numbers of people who have violated the curfew and lockdown orders. In Sri Lanka, 34,500 people were detained on violations of curfew and lockdown orders. In Myanmar, the figure is around 1200. This mitigates the efforts of decongesting as the prisons are again being filled to their maximum capacities thus making them vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The initiatives of countries across globe to decongest prisons to stop the spread of Coronavirus clearly illustrate that ‘<em>desperate times require desperate measures</em>.’ Decongestion is historic and remarkable; however, the same should not act as a tool for state governments to exploit certain group of prisoners. The instances of Iran, Algeria and Turkey elucidate how the method of various states to decongest prisons is in direct contravention of various international statutes. Moreover, it violates basics human rights by denying benefits to those who are in dire need of it. According to the Nelson <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/16-05081_E_rollup_Ebook.pdf">Mandela Rules</a>, The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, access to health and medical care is paramount and the same cannot be denied on any grounds. The arbitrary pardoning of prisoners, leaving vulnerable and low risk offenders in the prisons violates the <strong><em>right to life</em></strong> as provided in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The UN should take a stronger stand on this and should mandate all the states to prioritize the release of pending trial detainees, prisoners with medical conditions and low risk offenders. Additionally, those who are convicted of heinous offences, but are suffering from medical ailments should be provided with access to proper medical care. If any prisoner is reported to be Coronavirus positive, he or she should be provided with the requisite medical help and should be quarantined accordingly thus ensuring the welfare of the reported prisoner and the other inmates as well. Furthermore, governments, instead of instituting repressive measures unconnected to the pandemic, should be transparent, receptive and accountable in order to ensure that the basic rights of prisoners are not being waived.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It may appear a bit harsh but one is not really bothered about the storm until it reaches their doorstep. Unfortunate &amp; sad, but it’s a bitter truth about human nature and is clearly evident in the case of the Palghar lynching. The brutal killing of these two monks has gathered nationwide attention amid the hard times of COVID-19. The early response by the Bhartiya Janta Party, especially, looked a bit agonized by the fate of the Sadhus. Such a reaction is reasonable, but we as a nation needed a similar attitude and response to prevent earlier incidents of Mob Lynchings. Moreover, it is extremely sad that those monks had to die to provoke this kind of reaction in the minds of authorities. This blog post seeks to uncover tacitly working background factors allegedly responsible for such incidents and suggests a solution for this menace.

<strong>Government’s Attitude: Indifferent or Selective?</strong>

In almost every law and order situation, usually, the government is the first to be blamed, and it is not completely wrong as they have been provided with the power and might to maintain it. Aren’t they to blame? Putting it succinctly, the acts of state are backed by statutory force, which thus vests an obligation to maintain law &amp; order that is inexcusable. This has also been stressed by the Honorable Supreme Court in N<em>andini Sundar &amp; Ors. V. State of Chhattisgarh</em> where the court held that the state is responsible to prevent any untoward event and curb crime.

Ruchir Ferrero Sharma, an international policy researcher, argues that it is futile to <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/politics/india-doesnt-have-a-cow-vigilante-muslim-lynching-problem-but-a-mob-justice-meat-mafia-problem-that-can-be-solved?fbclid=IwAR2C5Jrc2zpV1AFeyOMpDIrW-xh_fMaj9nV4YIciMbNne_eZD55jS5BMlq4">criticize</a> leaders and claims it to be a law &amp; order issue rather. Surprisingly, it is unclear whom one should ask these questions if not the lawmakers on the issue of mob-lynchings, particularly when it's left unaddressed. The union government has already been criticized a lot for their love of promulgating <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/nda-takes-the-ordinance-route-narendra-modi-regime-outstrips-upas-pace-but-lags-behind-nehru-indira-5223831.html">ordinances</a>. Moreover, a much dirtier picture of the central government is painted when we realize how long the issue of mob lynching laws has lingered. Another blow to the government is the fate of the Tehseen Poonawalla case which put forth some basic <a href="https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2018/07/17/cow-vigilantism-lynching-no-citizen-can-assault-the-human-dignity-of-another-such-an-action-would-comatose-the-majesty-of-law-sc/">directions</a> and measures to control incidents of lynchings. However, those recommendations rots into the abyss with no actual actions being taken by the government &amp; the Supreme court appears a mere toothless tiger. Furthermore, all the enthusiasm that BJP has shown now was needed much more when little efforts were made by other <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/house-passes-anti-lynching-bill/articleshow/70544583.cms">states</a>. Lastly, the only thing of prime importance now is that we learn our lessons and team up to fight this evil and prevent any further misfortunes. “<strong>Better late than never</strong>.”

<strong>Police system: Complacent or Controlled?</strong>

“<strong>The police come after everything is over</strong>.” I believe most of us have heard similar kinds of proverbs. It may be a rare phenomenon now, but something’s gravely wrong with the response by the police and particularly the timing. Unfortunately, the police haven't paid the appropriate amount of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1121663051936096256">attention</a> and focus to the epicenter of this issue, i.e., the killings of cows and their security. Furthermore, there have been incidents of mob brutality even in the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hapur-lynching-up-police-apologise-after-viral-picture-shows-victim-being-dragged-in-cops-presence/story-vOzuCxh2qN2esq7NOL5wJL.html">presence</a> of police which appears to be a blot on the khaki uniform. Increased police surveillance, proper use of force, and adequate response to the problems of the common public is the need of the hour. However, in the above-mentioned circumstances, it’s difficult to locate a feasible solution for this evil.

However, a few events represent both <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/exclusive-how-violent-gau-rakshaks-and-police-work-in-tandem-1438261">complacency</a> and control of the police force. As a result, even the genuine <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/salute-heroic-cop-risked-own-life-to-save-two-in-mob-attack-that-killed-hyderabad-techie-in-karnatakas-bidar/1250327/">efforts</a> of some police personnel are rendered futile. One prominent factor of such failure is the pressure, be it psychological or physical (of being outnumbered). A few reports suggest that incidents of mob lynching frequently had some political <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/world/asia/india-jayant-sinha-lynch-mob.html">interference</a> and <a href="https://www.newsclick.in/political-silence-over-lynchings-sanction-another-means">silence</a> as well. Both these are slowly igniting the hellfire. Though saddening, it is much more frightening when <a href="https://www.thecitizen.in/index.php/en/NewsDetail/index/2/15698/Bulandshahar-Killings-Mark-a-Moment-of-Truth-for-the-UP-Police">members</a> of law enforcement falls prey to horrendous acts of lynchings.

<strong>Fear of Law: The Whip we need</strong>

Senior Supreme Court Advocate, K.T.S. Tulsi in an Outlook India <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-opinion-fear-of-law-has-evaporated-as-cases-of-lynching-have-become-regular-and-brazen/302503">article</a> deliberating about the rape of the young Telengana Veterinarian &amp; killing of her accused, identifies mob lynchings as an antithesis to the rule of law. Furthermore, he points out that when individuals/groups partaking in mob violence are not arrested immediately, it attacks public confidence in Rule of Law and weakens it. The author is not dwelling on the importance of the rule of law because this fundamental for the proper administration of Justice. It's the baseline and integral part of any civilized society. A similar opinion was expressed by Tehseen Poonawala when he criticized Union Minister Jayant Sinha's act of felicitating the convicts of the Ramgarh Mob Lynching. Surprisingly, the Palgahr killings received a completely different reaction altogether, be it from police, political parties, or the common citizenry. A prompt reaction like this is an apt response and a <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/prompt-arrests-in-palghar-incident-show-state-govts-can-always-act-fast-to-counter-communalism-if-they-want-to-8297501.html">whip</a> challenging horrendous acts of Mob Lynchings.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The most important lesson this country should learn is that these targeted informal killings don't have any connection whatsoever to any religion, caste, group, or ethnicity. Governments, irrespective of their political identity had tried time &amp; again to hide their incapacity in maintaining law &amp; order. Also giving it a religious/communal color for their political benefit is one more thing that has been employed for a long time. What we as citizens must take note of is this "<strong>A crime is devoid of any human relationship and doesn't deserve any</strong>."

Furthermore, the most effective manner to sum up the entire idea and solution proposed in this article is perfectly captured by the Hon’ ble Supreme Court in the case of <em>Krishnamoorthy v. Sivakumar and Ors</em>:
<blockquote>“The majesty of law cannot be sullied simply because an individual or a group generate the attitude that they have been empowered by the principles set out in law to take its enforcement into their own hands and gradually become law unto themselves and punish the violator on their own assumption and in the manner in which they deem fit.”</blockquote>
With respect to the sensitive and religious matter of cow protection, let's refrain from taking the law into our hands and help the authorities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For better or worse, the paradigmatic television show of the coronavirus pandemic is Netflix’s documentary miniseries <em>Tiger King</em>, an excruciatingly intimate reflection on a feud between two tiger-fanciers. On the one side is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Baskin">Carole Baskin</a>, the rather sanctimonious leader of a big cat sanctuary in Florida. And on the other is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Exotic">Joe Exotic</a>, the “colorful” operator of a glorified circus and petting zoo based in Oklahoma.

Not to spoil the surprise, but in 2018, Exotic was arrested and charged in federal court with 2 counts of murder-for-hire and 17 counts of animal abuse. He was eventually <a href="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/joe-exotic-civil-case-april-7.pdf">convicted</a> on all counts and sentenced to 22 years in federal prison. He is currently incarcerated at the Federal Medical Center Fort Worth. Exotic has filed several actions against the federal government, which are unlikely to succeed, and is seeking a pardon from President Trump.

How did Exotic come to such an ignominious end? Well, the proximate cause was a trio of intellectual property infringement actions that Baskin filed against Exotic and his organizations. When the court rejected Exotic’s counterclaims, he agreed to a consent judgment of about $1 million. And when he failed to pay, probably because he didn’t have the cash, he was essentially forced out of his zoo. Nursing a deep grudge, he made frequent threats against Baskin, and eventually offered to pay a hitman to kill her.

What was the basis for the intellectual property actions? Primarily, Baskin claimed Exotic had infringed the trademark rights of her sanctuary. But she also alleged several copyright infringement claims. As Mike Masnick of Techdirt has <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200421/17395744350/tiger-king-to-censorship-king-copyright-lobbyist-cheers-slapp-copyright-suit-featured-tiger-king.shtml">observed</a>, while Baskin had a viable trademark claim, her copyright claims were pretty dubious. But in any event, none of her claims were ever decided on the merits, because Exotic decided to settle.

I find Exotic’s decision quite curious, especially given the highly unfavorable terms of the settlement. One gets the impression that he never intended to pay, but discovered to his dismay that federal court orders are hard to avoid. Or maybe he just gave up. In any case, the story of the litigation is interesting, because it illustrates how people can repurpose intellectual property rights to serve their own goals.

Carole Baskin is the <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/contact-bcr/">president</a> and chief executive office of Big Cat Rescue Corporation, a charitable organization that operates a sanctuary for big cats and advocates for legislation to prohibit the private ownership of big cats. The sanctuary is in Tampa, Florida, and houses about 50 lions, tigers, bobcats, cougars, and other species of big cats. Baskin founded Big Cat Rescue in 1992, <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=BIGCATRESCUE%20N030000070471&amp;aggregateId=domnp-n03000007047-fff8c34f-ad3d-4bc5-a3c4-2ac7d93f072d&amp;searchTerm=big%20cat%20rescue&amp;listNameOrder=BIGCATRESCUE%20N030000070470">incorporated</a> it as a Florida nonprofit corporation in 1995, and obtained recognition as a <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/59-3330495">charitable</a> organization from the IRS in 1996.

In 2005, Big Cat Rescue <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76568568&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">registered</a> the following design mark for federal trademark protection.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96464" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/Big-Cat-Rescue-300x108.png" alt="" width="300" height="108" />

Among other things, the trademark registration explicitly <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=76568568&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">disclaimed</a> the word mark “BIG CAT RESCUE.” In other words, it claimed the logo as depicted, but not the name “big cat rescue.”

Joe Exotic (born Joseph Allen Schreibvogel, now Maldonado-Passage) was the director of the G.W. Exotic Animal Memorial Foundation, an animal park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma that houses about 700 animals of 50 different species. Exotic founded the park in 1999, and originally named it the Garold Wayne Exotic Animal Memorial Park, as a tribute to his deceased brother. He incorporated the G.W. Exotic Animal Memorial Foundation in 1999 as an Oklahoma nonprofit <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/corp/corpInformation.aspx?id=2100622733">corporation</a>, but didn’t apply for federal recognition as a charitable organization.

The park focused on tigers, and Exotic became known as the “Tiger King.” Among other things, it offered live shows and the opportunity to pet baby animals, especially baby tigers. Baskin and Big Cat Rescue were quite critical of Exotic and his park, accusing him of mistreating animals and discouraging people from attending his shows. Exotic was incensed by the criticism and regularly lashed out at Baskin on social media and his YouTube show. Among other things he used photos and videos taken by Baskin and her employees in order to cast them in a bad light, including images of them killing rabbits and feeding them to tigers.

But in 2010, Exotic escalated the dispute by <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/corp/corpInformation.aspx?id=2112270578">forming</a> Big Cat Rescue Entertainment Group Inc., an Oklahoma nonprofit corporation that he used to advertise and present live shows. Here is a representative image.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96465" src="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/Big-Cat-Entertainment-300x141.png" alt="" width="300" height="141" />

Among other things, Exotic used a Florida phone number for Big Cat Rescue Entertainment, presumably because many of his customers knew Big Cat Rescue was located in Florida.

On January 31, 2011, Big Cat Rescue filed a trademark infringement action against Big Cat Rescue Entertainment, G.W., and Exotic, among others, alleging infringement of both their registered design mark and their unregistered word mark “Big Cat Rescue.” Under the Lanham Act, federal trademark law protects both registered and unregistered marks, albeit in slightly different ways. Accordingly, even though Big Cat Rescue hadn’t registered the word mark, it could still sue for infringement based on its use of the mark.

Essentially, trademark law provides that it is infringing to use a distinctive mark in a way that will confuse consumers about the source of a product or service and thereby harm the commercial interests of the owner of the mark. In other words, the Big Cat Rescue Entertainment mark would be infringing if it made consumers think it was advertising Big Cat Rescue.

In my opinion, Big Cat Rescue’s claim for infringement of its registered design mark was weak, at best. The only registered mark was Big Cat Rescue’s logo, and the respective logos are not at all similar. They use very different images, and don’t even use the same font.

Big Cat Rescue’s claim for infringement of its unregistered word mark was much stronger, but only if the word mark was protected in the first place. A trademark can be protected only if it is distinctive, and “BIG CAT RESCUE” has a borderline case for protection, at best. A descriptive mark is protectable only if it actually communicates information to consumers about the source of a product or service, and a generic mark is not protected at all. In other words, “BIG CAT RESCUE” isn’t protectable unless it tells consumers not only what Big Cat Rescue does, but also who they are. And it isn’t protectable at all if it is merely a generic term for an animal sanctuary focused on big cats.

The “BIG CAT RESCUE” word mark is weak. After all, Big Cat Rescue explicitly disclaimed it when registering its design mark, presumably because it realized that registration was unlikely. Indeed, when Big Cat Rescue filed a trademark registration application for the word mark “BIG CAT RESCUE” in 2013, the trademark examiner initially rejected it as “merely descriptive,” observing “both the individual components and the composite result are descriptive of applicant’s goods and/or services and do not create a unique, incongruous, or non-descriptive meaning in relation to the goods and/or services.” While the Trademark Office eventually <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=85850084&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">granted</a> the application in 2014, after Big Cat Rescue submitted voluminous additional evidence in support, I am not convinced it made the right decision, at least in part because the mark is arguably not even descriptive, but merely generic.

After all, why did Big Cat Rescue choose that mark? Obviously, as the examiner observed, because it is the broadest possible way of describing the work of an animal sanctuary devoted to rescuing big cats. Of course, businesses find such expansive marks quite attractive. Not only are they effective at communicating information to consumers, but also they enable the suppression of competition. After all, there is nothing better than a mark that prevents your competitor from using the most effective description of the good or service they also provide.

But the purpose of trademark law is to encourage fair competition, not to prevent it. That is why we prohibit the registration and enforcement of generic marks. If competitors need to be able to use a term in order to fairly compete, that term can’t and shouldn’t be protectable as a trademark.

Sure, Exotic intentionally used the “BIG CAT RESCUE” mark in order to both troll Baskin and confuse consumers. But maybe that’s irrelevant, if “BIG CAT RESCUE” shouldn’t be a protectable mark in the first place. What if another animal sanctuary focused on big cats wanted to use the term “big cat rescue” to describe its purpose, for legitimate and non-confusing reasons? Should Big Cat Rescue be able to stop them, merely because it has dominated the market sector? Or should it have chosen a more distinctive mark in the first place, if it wanted to be able to claim exclusivity?

In any case, Big Cat Rescue also filed two copyright infringement actions, alleging that Exotic had used Baskin’s copyrighted photos and videos, without her permission. While those claims were superficially plausible, they were actually quite weak, for both formal and substantive reasons. For one thing, Baskin wasn’t actually the author of the photos and videos, but rather purchased the copyright from the original authors. Not a problem! Copyrights can be sold. But you can’t sue for copyright infringement until a work is registered with the Copyright Office, and Baskin purchased and registered the copyrights after they were infringed. Still not a problem! But she also claimed statutory damages for infringement, rather than actual economic damages, and statutory damages are only available when a work is registered when it is infringed. That is a problem, because statutory damages can be cripplingly large - up to $150,000 per infringement! - precisely because economic damages are so hard to prove. Without statutory damages, Baskin ran the risk of winning the infringement action and getting nothing in exchange for her troubles.

But the more fundamental problem with Big Cat Rescue’s copyright infringement claims was Exotic’s strong fair use defense. The fair use doctrine provides that using a copyright image for the purpose of commentary or criticism is not copyright infringement. One of the primary purposes of the fair use doctrine is to ensure that copyright owners don’t abuse copyright by using it to silence their critics. In other words, fair use is a kind of copyright “escape valve” to protect free speech.

While Exotic’s use of the photos and videos of Baskin and her employees was crass, misleading, and mean-spirited, it was also core free speech. After all, he used them precisely in order to criticize Baskin and Big Cat Rescue. Indeed, he used them in order to respond to allegations Baskin made about him. That is precisely the kind of speech the fair use doctrine was created in order to protect. And more to the point, it is precisely the kind of speech that copyright is supposed to ignore. After all, copyright is all about ensuring authors can benefit from the economic value of the works they create. Baskin wasn’t interested in the economic value of the photos and videos she purchased. She was interested in forcing Exotic to shut up, and in harming him. Understandably! But that isn’t and shouldn’t be a legitimate or enforcable copyright claim.

Anyway, Exotic responded to Big Cat Rescue’s complaints with a smorgasbord of weak counterclaims, including defamation and tortious interference with his business. But Exotic also pleaded defenses, including that the “BIG CAT RESCUE” mark was generic or merely descriptive and copyright fair use. After considerable litigation and recrimination, the court predictably and correctly granted Big Cat Rescue’s motion for summary judgment on Exotic’s counterclaims.

But the court also rejected Exotic’s defenses. There, I think it was wrong, or at least that it failed to fully evaluate the claims and responses. After all, the burden was on Big Cat Rescue to show that it owned a valid trademark in the term “BIG CAT RESCUE,” not on Exotic to show that it didn’t. While Big Cat Rescue made a prima facie case for copyright infringement, it didn’t show it was entitled to statutory damages. And the court simply ignored Exotic’s fair use defense, holding that it was a question of fact for the jury. That’s just wrong. Courts often decide clear fair use cases on a motion to dismiss or summary judgment. And it doesn’t get much clearer than this.

Regardless, Exotic was done. Soon after the court rejected his counterclaims, he settled. In other words, the court never actually ruled on the validity of Big Cat Rescue’s claimed word mark or the viability of its copyright infringement claims. Exotic just gave up and agreed to pay.

I find that troubling. Not because Exotic was in the right or because Baskin was in the wrong, but because that’s not the purpose of trademark or copyright. Understandably, Baskin used the intellectual property tools at her disposal to go after Exotic. And boy was she ever successful, even if she never actually collected on most of the judgment. But is that a victory, or an indictment of how we expect people to defend themselves against intellectual property infringement claims?

Notably, the settlement was curiously one-sided. Even assuming Baskin was right and would have won at trial, it’s unlikely she would have gotten much more than an injunction prohibiting Exotic from using the mark “BIG CAT RESCUE.” While trademark plaintiffs can get damages, they have to prove them. And it’s hard to see how Baskin would have proven meaningful trademark-related damages, let alone anything approaching $1 million Exotic agreed to pay.

Why did Exotic settle? It’s hard to say. Tiger King suggests that he was hoping to just wriggle out of ever paying anything. After all, G.W. eventually filed for bankruptcy and sold its assets to Jeff Lowe, who <a href="https://www.wynnewoodzoo.org/">reopened</a> the park as the Greater Wynnewood Animal Park. Presto change-o! But maybe Exotic just bit off more than he could chew. Maybe he was tired of the litigation and the money Baskin forced him to spend on it. Maybe he was skeptical of his attorneys, who made some curious litigation decisions along the way. Maybe his attorneys were tired of him. Who knows.

In any case, is any of that any way to do intellectual property infringement litigation? I don’t think so. We should want and expect an answer on the merits, not mere gamesmanship. And maybe, just maybe, courts could do a little more to de-escalate interpersonal conflicts, rather than effectively fanning the flames. This should never have been an intellectual property dispute in the first place. It had nothing to do with intellectual property, and everything to do with ideology and personal animosity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is now known to every country, city, town, village and family. The pandemic is spreading like wildfire and the human race is fighting every second to defeat this invisible enemy. On the <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/3/who-announces-covid-19-outbreak-a-pandemic">12th</a> of March, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and India on 22nd March, 2020, initiated the <a href="https://theprint.in/india/modi-announces-janata-curfew-on-22-march-urges-for-resolve-restraint-to-fight-coronavirus/384138/">Janta Curfew</a> following which the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown of 21 days taking effect on 25th March, 2020. On 14th April, 2020, it was extended until the 3rd of May 2020, while assuring Indians that essential services would continue, thereby imposing reasonable restrictions on the majority of fundamental rights. This is the first time in the history of India where a disease is testing the fabric of the Constitution itself.

According to German Philosopher Jurgen Habermas “Human rights is a concept that is not only of a moral origin but also juridical by nature, meaning thereby, that they are positive and coercive law which supports justiciable subjective right claims through their structure.” He says that these rights are to be respected by the Government and its officials and the authorities should restrain themselves from taking any arbitrary actions no matter the circumstance. The effectiveness of the government's protection of basic rights is a perfect yardstick.

Part III of the Constitution of India enshrines within itself Fundamental Rights, which cannot be abrogated at any cost (except in a time of emergency), and through the lens of the lockdown, public discourse was projected to surround two major rights: these are the Right to Life and Right to Equality. These two rights are natural rights that are inherent in nature and no individual can be deprived of these rights. According to <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 4</a> of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, (hereinafter referred to as ‘ICCPR’) States in an emergency can suspend some of these rights but <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 4(2)</a> states some of the rights mentioned in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 6</a> that cannot be derogated from. Article 6 of the ICCPR talks about the right to life of every citizen. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India talks about the right to life and personal liberty but these are not limited to that only, various judicial pronouncements have interpreted the Article to embody in itself the Right to Health and the Right to food. The Supreme Court in <em>Chameli Singh and Ors. v. State of UP and Ors.</em> <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/18928039/">broadened</a> the definition of right to life and said:
<blockquote>“Right to live guaranteed in any civilized society implies the right to food, water, decent environment, education, medical care and shelter These are basic human rights known to any civilized society. All civil, political, social and cultural rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Convention or under the Constitution of India cannot be exercised without these basic human rights.”</blockquote>
Recently the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner issued <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/displaynews.aspx">guidelines</a> on the 9th of April, 2020 suggesting Covid-19 responses to be taken by every state. It was pointed out in the Guidelines that the virus is likely to create inequalities and so states should take actions to ensure that human rights of its citizens are not affected. The guidelines <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/displaynews.aspx">addressed</a> the plight of marginalized sections of the Society such as Migrant workers’, Disabled people, LGBTQ and said it will be a challenge for governments to take effective measures. Under this lockdown, we (well-off Indians) are quarantined indoors, work from home and get groceries delivered and enjoy all the possible rights. But outside our windows, it's a different journey for the marginalized sections of our society.

A journey of hundreds and thousands of Indian migrant workers from different states lumbering for miles and miles on highways has been portrayed in newspapers and television screens for days. Witnessing this journey is very heart breaking. People can be seen with luggage roosted on their heads, babies in arms, and elderly family members struggling alongside. Migrants are fleeing to their native villages. The concept of social distancing is prevailing in the organized sector by engaging in work from home, but for unorganized workers who are paid on a daily basis amidst this lockdown are not able to fulfil their needs, social distancing is difficult to implement. As a consequence of which the nation witnessed the horrifying incident of migrant workers gathering in Delhi. Over <a href="https://www.ilo.org/newdelhi/areasofwork/informal-economy/lang--en/index.htm">80 percent</a> of the Indian population is employed in the Unorganized Sector and a majority of them are casual laborers.

The on-going lockdown and migration of labor class, once again has shown the face of police brutality. News channels are flooding with videos where police are brutally beating these people for violating the norms of lockdown, even if they was out to procure essential products. The government has <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">invoked</a> Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which gives it power to take all those actions that are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease and safeguard the interest of its citizens. <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">Section 3</a> of the Act provides penalty for disobedience of any regulation or order made under the Act and provides punishment under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1432790/">Section 188</a> of Indian Penal Code and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/621703/">195</a> Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 prescribe that for a court to take cognizance of an offence, a First Information Report (FIR) is insufficient and a written complaint should be made to the magistrate by the public officer. This gives a free hand to public authorities to punish the offender by beating them brutally and simply doing away with the requirement of writing the complaint. Section 4 of the Act provides for discretion completely absolving the officers of their actions under the Act.

To cater to the needs of daily wage workers, the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act, 2008 was <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2100/1/A2008-33.pdf">introduced</a> so that the unorganized workers could benefit of all the Government welfare schemes. But the main loophole in the Act is <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2100/1/A2008-33.pdf">Section 10</a> which mandates the worker to get registered by submitting an application to the District Administration in order to receive a certificate of registration. Recently, the Government introduced Pradhanmantri Garib Kalyan Yojna for the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pradhan-Mantri-Garib-Kalyan-Yojana-package">welfare</a> of the poor and marginalized workers but amidst Covid-19, it is not practical for us to think that every worker will be registered under Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act and as result those unregistered workers will be denied rights.

As we are discussing the condition of Indian workers, the struggle of individuals with disability isn't any different. Here the question is: when physical contact is prohibited, and our public facilities don't seem to be disability-friendly and barrier-free, have Indian authorities given any thought on how persons with disabilities will manage their mobility and access services? Policy makers must take into consideration whether someone with vision impairment, without guidance, is ready to spot the precise location of open shops, medical stores, hospitals? People with cognitive disabilities may need assistance even to access their government grant from their bank accounts. In the absence of accessible public facilities and assistive technologies, people with disabilities need human assistance. But social distancing makes this difficult. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Statistics, 2.2 per cent of India’s population is disabled. In effect, <a href="https://theprint.in/india/relying-on-kindness-of-people-indias-disabled-bear-the-brunt-of-covid-19-lockdown/390631/">86</a> out of every 1,000 Indians have a disability.

As has been mentioned above, The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities on the 9th of April, 2020 <a href="http://disabilityaffairs.gov.in/content/page/whats-new.php">wrote</a> to the states and Union Territories to follow guidelines in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. One of the numerous suggestions given by the department was “reserving specific opening hours in retail provision stores including supermarkets for persons with disabilities." In <a href="https://theprint.in/india/relying-on-kindness-of-people-indias-disabled-bear-the-brunt-of-covid-19-lockdown/390631/">Telangana</a>, officials of the Department for Women, Children, Disabled and Senior Citizens said that they have yet to implement the guidelines. In other states too, this suggestion seems to have not been taken seriously. The guidelines also task the states to provide special passes to the differently-abled if they have to go out. Some states are also providing them directly with essential items to further help them. On the ground, however, differently-abled are facing their own challenges every day despite the guidelines. Even though the government undertook initiatives to resolve their issues when the country was all set to enter the second week of lockdown, many people with disabilities across the country feel these initiatives are too little and too late.

Likewise is the condition of transgender individuals. They are socially discriminated against in India. Most of them have been forced out by their families as a result of which many have to indulge in begging and prostitution. During the lockdown this community is also going through a lot. Their major source of income is begging which is not sufficient to fulfill their basic needs such as food and health supplies. According to a <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/governance/covid-19-what-about-the-transgender-community--70151">report</a> by National Centre for Transgender Equality (US based non-profit organization), many people from the LGBTQ community have weak immunity due to which they suffer from cancer, HIV aids, etc., which makes them even more prone to this contagious disease. Recently, the High Courts of <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/karnataka-hc-directs-state-to-extend-relief-to-transgenders-155041">Karnataka</a> and <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/covid19-jharkhand-hc-directs-state-govt-to-ensure-basic-neccesities-for-transgenders-during-lockdown-seeks-reply-on-other-welfare-measures-155481">Jharkhand</a> directed state governments to ensure safety of transgender individuals but the main issue here is that most of the transgender individuals don’t have ration cards, aadhar cards, or bank accounts due to which it is not possible for them to benefit from government welfare schemes as has been well <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/13/india-identification-project-threatens-rights">documented</a> here by Aakar Patel (Executive Director at Amnesty International India):
<blockquote>“Making an Aadhar Card a prerequisite to access essential services and benefits can obstruct access to several constitutional rights, including the rights of people to food, healthcare, education and social security.”</blockquote>
To <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/TG bill gazette.pdf">safeguard</a> the rights of transgender people The Transgender (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 was enacted but was not well-received by people from the transgender community as the bill deviates from what was laid down in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/193543132/">NALSA v. UOI</a> because the act provides for a very narrow definition to the term transgender and also the mechanism provided in the act is very inappropriate. The Act mandates every transgender person submit an application to the District magistrate under <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/TG bill gazette.pdf">Section 5</a> after which District Magistrate will refer the application to the committee after which the person has to go through a screening process under <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/TG bill gazette.pdf">Section 6</a> and after the committee is satisfied that all the conditions are met then the respective person is issued a certificate of third gender under <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/TG bill gazette.pdf">Section 7</a>. This differs from the Supreme Court Judgment in which Justice Radhakrishnan said “<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1142233/">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution states that all citizens shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, which includes one’s right to expression of his self-identified gender." As per the Act only a few transgender individuals will be able to benefit from government welfare schemes which will make their situation even worse as they are deprived of their basic right to health and livelihood.

Policemen, Health Workers and all the COVID-19 warriors are being praised by everyone in society and are worth the appreciation as they are our frontline warriors but SafaiKaramcharis/Sanitation workers are our unsung heroes amidst the current scenario. Like health workers they also prevent the society from getting infected by cleaning its waste, but the difference between the two is that the latter is paid very low in proportion to the duties they discharge. Health Workers are provided with PPE kits, but these Sanitation Workers are not provided adequate health facilities which they should be provided with as it is their right to health under Article 21. Recently, in <a href="https://www.mumbailive.com/en/civic/cleaning-workers-wifes-death-due-to-coronavirus-48156">Dharavi</a> one of the sanitation workers got infected with the virus which resulted in his wife also testing positive for covid-19 and dying unfortunately. This illustrates that when they are provided with inadequate facilities at work they put their lives at risk and touch those surfaces which we dread to touch. Recently, various State Governments announced compensation to the families of the deceased health workers for example: the Delhi Government announced compensation amounting to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/india/news/delhi-cm-announces-1-crore-compensation-to-families-of-health-workers-in-case-of-death/articleshow/74930647.cms">1 crore</a> and the Rajasthan Government announced compensation amounting to <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/rajasthan-govt-announces-rs-50-lakh-compensation-for-staff-who-die-due-to-covid-19-while-on-duty-2573065.html">50 Lakhs</a>, but nothing has been done for the safaikaramcharis who are discharging such a crucial service to the society. The Supreme Court in the Case of <em>Safai Karamchari Andolan &amp; Ors. v. Union of India</em> <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/6155772/">directed</a> the government that a compensation of 10 lakhs has to be given to the family of sanitation workers in case of their death but no such directions have been issued by the government in the present scenario.

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>

In the situation of this hardship, we understand the efforts taken by the Government to protect its citizen from this pandemic but through this article, we want to acquaint the readers with the fact that, before implementing lockdown in a country like India, it is expected of the government to take into account the problems of marginalized sections of society and that there are some rights that cannot be derogated, as not everyone in the society is privileged enough to fulfill their basic needs. Covid-19 is a disease that has affected millions around the globe socially, economically and psychologically. It is a known fact that the Government actions will create inequalities in the society but the main question will be how effective those actions are, as in current times the above mentioned communities are going through acute hardship. Part III of the Indian Constitution Guarantees right to life and equality which are inherent rights and are to be safeguarded by the Government. As has been aptly said by the Chairperson of Human Rights Commission HC Bracelet that:
<blockquote>“<em>This is a colossal test of leadership. It demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all and for all. We are physically distant today, but we must stand together.</em>”</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[COVID-19 patients are frequently constrained to solitary confinement in order to curb the continuing spread of the contamination. The race for medicine or a vaccine to treat COVID-19 is on. The pharmaceutical industries are being asked to donate the intellectual property (IP) of the relevant medicinal equipment or medicines by officials advocating for public health interests. The WTO’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement in contrast is fashioned to sustain the rights of the <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips.pdf">inventors</a>.

Now the issue is why should they give out the pharmaceutical patents in an unrestricted manner? And it is a reasonable question involving intellectual property rights, assurances fulfilling required quantities, and the nature developing countries’ administrative and economical competence. In fact, many of these countries have not up until now flourished pertinent national standards to mesh cogently with the obligations they owe under TRIPS.

This has still yet to be examined for the treatment of COVID-19 where people are still desperately searching for anything to combat the malignant disease. Leading biotech and pharmaceutical firms are in a scramble to invent and evolve explicit vaccines and drugs. If they succeed and become a holder of the pharmaceutical patent, then they will be financially favored and their rights will be protected by the TRIPS Agreement. They will have had to endure the struggles and confer the expenditures while other competitors revitalize and take compatible initiatives ultimately favoring society at large. Nonetheless poor and developing countries often find it troublesome to afford because freshly patented meds attain an exorbitant initial cost. Taking into account the ebb and flow of the COVID-19 pandemic, patent holders will seek to provide their medicinal supplements to aid premier destinations of public interest.

<strong>What Are Pharmaceutical Patents and Why Do They Exist?</strong>

A pharmaceutical company, when it generates a fresh medicine for any illness will market it under by a “brand name" and “the patent” grants the company marketing and manufacture rights which inclined with profit concerns mainly assist in balancing the expenditures required to produce the med.

Now when the patent is terminated, different companies can manufacture the medicine replicating the branded drug but the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-answers/generic-drugs-questions-answers">generic</a> medicine they create must be bioequivalent to the branded med in characteristics, quality, safety, dosage form, and the intended usage.

The global politics concerning pharmaceutical IP has been mostly about the struggle between <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp">R&amp;D companies</a> and their governments on one side and developing countries and NGOs (upholding the public’s right to reasonable medications) on the other. Certain companies may abuse patents for monetary benefits which can impede progress. Lawmakers must be discreet regarding patents, visualizing the plots in their detrimental exercise under this deadlock positioning because even when the creation may be pivotal to extricate lives, patents can exclude many people from access.

<strong>The TRIPS Agreement</strong>

The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement was designed as an approach to assemble IP rights beneath a synthesized scheme of international rules. Its aim is to shield the rights of inventors respecting expenditures from the research to conjointly determine the least possible specifications necessary for lawmaking and techniques to administer IP laws implementation at the national level. However, it results in the creation of dominating <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/its-monopolies-stupid">monopolies</a> which often manipulate trade regarding vital products like lifesaving drugs. Patents may escalate the valuation of pharmaceutical products to the customers as long as they allow pharmaceutical companies to set rates surpassing the peripheral amount of their manufacturing costs and impeding competition.

Under <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips.pdf">Article 31</a> of the TRIPS Agreement, any Member State or any entity can manufacture a generic replica of a pharmaceutical appliance or medication by holding a “<a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/public_health_faq_e.htm">compulsory license</a>” without the approval of the owner of the patent amid a national emergency, public emergency, governmental use or any circumstantial extreme urgency, contingent on assured limitations that is- the patent holder should be indemnified a decent value disposed of by the government, the medicine should be used for domestic purpose only for a narrow course of time as uninterrupted production of the medication might cause intrusion on the rights of the patent holder.

Developing countries are concerned about the influence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on TRIPs on their economies. Where access to medications is uncertain, technologically impoverished States are certain to encounter a sharp reality due to the monopolistic nature of pharmaceutical patent rights.

<strong>A Pharmaceutical Patent Should Not Be a Limiting Factor in the Pandemic</strong>

For decades, commercial pharmaceutical industries have been locking up IPs pertaining to life-saving drugs by prolonging the period of patents and coming up with intangible or unconscionable secondary patents. They have also lobbied against ratification and manufacture of generic products.

Monopoly is holding us back, in this prevailing pandemic. When patents are involved, the technology necessary in this pandemic like adequate testing kits, respirators, N95s, and others each carry complications for manufacturers to produce fresh equipment appropriately. A worse situation may emerge when, for treatments, there are multiple patents and, due to competition, affordability and supply will be the key factors at stake for developing countries. Most developing countries are now confiding in leading pharmaceutical firms expecting some expedient outcomes for medications, vaccines, clinical trials and parallel technologies. This ultimately conveys the suppliers, the holders of the patent, the ability to charge excessive prices without the efficiency to carry these products for developing countries.

Conjecturing on the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5a364eb0-780c-11ea-bd25-7fd923850377">several</a> biotech communities and pharmaceutical companies have displayed enthusiasm to allot and publish transparently the information on medications and clinical experiments that may help. Besides potential public intercession is essential notably in developing countries to save their right to life. Because when Gilead, producer of remdisivir (an empirical antiviral med to cure COVID-19) had filed a patent application with a status of “<a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-asks-fda-to-rescind-remdesivir-orphan-drug-tag-after-public-backlash">orphan drug</a>,” a public objection made them withdraw the application prevented them from acquiring a vigorous monopoly.

Moreover, COVID-19 stirred countries, especially the developing ones who are lagging behind in terms of finances, to utilize patented drugs at a modest rate by declaring “state emergency” and resorting to the law of “compulsory license” supporting their consistent patent statutes with a view to require regional pharma companies to generate medicine to preserve the right to life of their citizens.

<strong>Some last words</strong>

It is virtually impossible to combat despotic monopolies because they have remarkable financial assets and cardinal research effectiveness. Being in a superior market position, high-caliber pharmaceutical organizations conspire to uphold uniform medicine rates across the world, despite ample disparity between developing, underdeveloped and developed countries, out of fear that if they allow poor or developing countries to buy medication with reasonable cost than developed countries may also urge the same price which they believe will lead to monetary devastation for them.

The illusion that to protect the IP rights is “necessary” in a pandemic was disproven when the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (<a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/en/">GISRS</a>) assembled experts from all over the world for <a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol102/iss6/3/">discussion</a> regarding the vaccine. In this era of the COVID-19 pandemic, questions of prudence and morality should have arisen to reduce the death toll. Several hopeful recommendations from policymakers and scholars have now appeared, for instance, the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/03/24/covid19-coronavirus-costa-rica-intellectual-property/">proposal</a> for an intellectual property pool by Costa Rica which may ignite hope.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the late 1920s scratch farmers and loggers were facing an unseen threat in the isolated forests of the inland Pacific Northwest of America. Crops were scarred and charred. They had stunted timber yields. The culprit turned out to be a huge zinc smelter In Trail, British Columbia that bellowed sulfurous fumes from across the Canadian border. In the impacted regions of the United States, the smelter was secretly laying waste to livelihoods, economies and habitats. In the end, the U.S. State Department took up the cause of the affected people. The Canadian government – desiring mutually beneficial trade ties with its southern neighbor – stepped in for the smelter and decided to have international arbitration settle the issues of liability, penalties, and compensation.

Today, law students around the world are <a href="https://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_III/1905-1982.pdf">studying</a> the ‘Trail Smelter Arbitration’ as a foundational case in contemporary international law. The arbitration panel announced two revolutionary legal concepts relating to trans-boundary damages in its judgments. First, that no nation has the right to use or require its territory to cause harm to another's territory or to the property or person(s) therein. Second, that a polluting state has to compensate for the harm caused by polluting activities on their own territory. Canada was eventually forced to pay US reparations.

The People's Republic of China achieved tremendous economic growth, rapid poverty reduction and complete integration into the world economy over a period of 35 years. China used the wealth gained from these integrations to construct infrastructure for the country and to expand into the second largest economy in the world. But all the miles of new high-speed rail lines and the glistening new cities erected helped to obscure the fact that the governing Communist Party was not modernizing the fundamentals of China's regulatory framework, including in the food and drug sectors. Nor did China modernize labor standards and the rule of law. When it came to public health laws, China remained well behind the norms of the West, even as its economy and social life became more enmeshed with those of the West. This is significant because China's goods enter every corner of the globe as a globalized economic juggernaut. Its citizens, as business people and visitors, fly to every part of the globe. And China's booming economy attracts foreigners for work and tourism, many of whom engage in the food and drug markets of the country before moving around the world.

The poorly controlled food market in China has caused one health crisis after another. Prior to the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, China suffered greatly during the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1957-1958-pandemic.html">1957</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html">1968</a> Asian pandemics. In the years after China's adoption of its "reform and opening up" policies and its 2001 entrance into the World Trade Organization, the 2002 SARS crisis, the 2008 milk processing scandal, and the 2009 H1N1 crisis have beset China and countries around the world. The Chinese people might have preferred life-saving health and food safety legislation to infrastructural decorations, but the political stranglehold of the ruling party on society enables it to disregard or stifle the kinds of common reform demands that have brought drastic, life-saving reforms to the democratic world over the past century.

The incompetence of Chinese political leaders has helped make the coronavirus pandemic possible – it has taken the world economy to the verge of collapse, and it’s filling hospitals and cemeteries across the globe. It is generally known that the uncontrolled selling of wildlife in open wet markets – like the Wuhan wet market – was the original cause of the novel coronavirus being contracted by humans. The <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/">journal</a>, <em>Scientific American</em>, states that "Multiple teams have proposed in preprint studies that <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485v1">pangolins</a> may have been an intermediate host" of the virus most likely originating in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12711">bats</a> in the area. And, to aggravate the crisis, China's leadership ignored evidence of the virus, allowed New Year celebrations to continue and did not limit Wuhan's travel until months after the outbreak started.

Even as the cases began to rise exponentially after the first case was registered on the 17th of November and a record 266 cases were registered on the 31st of December and 381 were registered on the first day of 2020, the medical authorities declined permission to announce the outbreak internally and to the public, despite the urgent warnings of doctors on the front line. Any evidence of substantial person-to-person virus transmission was ruled out by the WHO on the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/coronavirus-the-cost-of-chinas-public-health-cover-up/ar-BBZHChH">14th</a> of January while stopping short of declaring an emergency for public safety. Only after President Xi Jinping's first recognition of the outbreak on the 20th of January that the virus can be transmitted amongst humans was Wuhan put under lockdown. The lockdown was initiated on January 22, but by then five million travelers had already left Wuhan through the air, posing a severe threat to the world.

In the midst of these changes, after two-thirds of the victims sampled were connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, it was closed on the 1st of January, one day after China reported the outbreak to the WHO. In February, instead, the WHO asked countries not to enforce travel <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-04-20/h_267d4c445f4bf4730abca05eccc62c67">restrictions</a>. Closing the Huanan Seafood market, however, is a tacit recognition on the CPC's part that the transfer from person-to-person originated from there itself.

The 2003 SARS epidemic led China to ban the breeding, transportation, and selling of civets and other wild animals, but six months later, the ban was lifted. Even now, China has only placed a partial ban on its wet markets, with the UN Convention on Biological Diversity's acting executive secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/ban-live-animal-markets-pandemics-un-biodiversity-chief-age-of-extinction">calling</a> for a blanket ban on wildlife markets worldwide, including that in Wuhan. In addition, Wuhan Public Security's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-wuhan-doctor-ai-fen-speaks-out-against-authorities">detention</a> of eight doctors who posted information about the virus on social media exemplifies China's opaque governance structure.

Given China's experience with the SARS pandemic in 2003, the CPC could at least control the infection in China by acting on the International Health Regulations (IHR) guidelines by simply exchanging timely and reliable information on the pandemic with the WHO. But omissions on the part of the Chinese establishment allowed COVID-19 to spread around the world, unprecedently affecting global health and the economy, displaying a deliberate act of mendacity.

Therefore, to maintain an international order based on laws and upholding the right to life, safety and democracy, countries need to work together to pursue appropriate legal action against those responsible for wrongdoing. Any one of the possible solutions below might provide the right avenue.

<strong>1. Wrongful Acts under Article 2 of the Draft Articles on Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), 2001</strong>

Article 2 of the Draft articles on Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Act (ARSIWA) 2001, defines ‘wrongful acts’ as those that are ‘attributable to the state’ and that ‘constitute a breach of an international obligation.' Post the virus release, the responsibility flowed from WIV to local Wuhan authorities to President Xi himself, all being organs of the state of China and hence their conduct is attributable to China.

In regards to violation of an international agreement, China failed to comply with its due diligence obligations intentionally by issuing <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-16/reporters-notebook-what-two-months-of-reporting-has-taught-caixin-about-the-coronavirus-101529285.html">gag orders</a> not disclosing appropriate and timely details, forcing biotech companies to stop research. Due diligence is a principle of good governance which assesses whether a state has done what was reasonably expected of it when it responded to a harm or threat. This norm, which is integrated into numerous principles of traditional and customary international law, applies <em>inter alia</em> to climate, human rights and world public health. China has not adhered to such laws, which enforce obligations of conduct requiring states to avoid, stop and/or resolve a number of internal or trans-boundary harms, or the danger of them. Furthermore, China also infringed <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf">Article 14</a> of ARSIWA by refusing to exchange details promptly and transparently with the WHO in accordance with the IHR consequently extending its violation over the entire duration during which the act proceeded and remained in non-compliance with international obligations. Notably, a Southampton University epidemiological <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20029843v3.full.pdf">model</a> found out that if China had behaved professionally faster by one, two, or three weeks, the cases would have decreased by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively.

<strong>2. China's Guilt under Article 7(1) of the ICC</strong>

Furthermore, a global pandemic does not happen when a novel infectious pathogen emerges, but when, due to a failure to provide public services in regulated food and marketplaces which would prevent the transmission of pathogens and control their movements, it starts spreading, as has been the case in Wuhan. The recklessness shown by Chinese health authorities makes China a guilty of Article 7(1) of the ICC as per the eleventh act, namely, “other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health" as mentioned under ‘crimes against humanity.’

<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf">Article 15</a> gives authority to the prosecutor's office at the ICC to conduct proceedings <em>proprio motu</em> (on its own initiative) on the basis of information relating to crimes within the jurisdiction of the court. All of this having been said, the jury is out as to whether ICC has any authority over China. While the common public opinion seeks to drag China to the ICC, this must be done after careful review of the appropriate legal framework, as was the case in an Appeal No. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2020_00828.PDF">ICC-02/17 OA4</a>, where the prosecutor was allowed to open and conduct an investigation into the actions of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, despite the fact that the U.S. was not a member of the ICC.

<strong>3. Violations of the International Health Regulations (IHR)</strong>

In addition, the IHR were adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1969 to prevent the international spread of disease by placing an obligation on states to prevent highly transmissible disease. This was updated in 2007 in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, to which China failed to oblige. China also violated several other articles of the IHR like Article 6, wherein a state has to notify all events which may constitute a “public health emergency of international concern” within its territory within 24 hours and to inform WHO all relevant public health information under Article 7.

<a href="https://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf#page=17">Article 75</a> further provides that any disagreement concerning the application of the constitution of the WHO shall be referred to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Reading the above as a holistic whole could cause the ICJ to invoke its contentious authority in the absence of at least any assessment of Chinese duty, omissions, and commissions. We emphasize that this potential finding by the ICJ against China is in no way enforceable against China, but it may nevertheless be the first step towards a substantive legal finding after proper application of the judiciary.

All of the above can be employed as a strong quasi-judicial and diplomatic pressure tactic on China in order to make her accountable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"What does not benefit the entire hive is no benefit to the bee." -Marcus Aurelius, <em>Meditations</em></blockquote>
From the beginning, Donald Trump's ideology of "America First" has been misconceived. In essence, any concocted presidential notion that exploitative and self-aggrandizing American postures can propel the United States in gainful directions is grievously fanciful. Looked at somewhat differently, that is, from another equally valid level of foreign policy assessment, the current presidential notion of American "<a style="cursor: help" title="The philosophic origins of such 'realistic' thinking lie heavily in the classical 'Argument of Thrasymachus,' offered in Book 1 of Plato's Republic: 'Right is the interest of the stronger.' In the final analysis, such alleged realism has always proven to be both unrealistic and law-violating.">realism</a>" is deeply immoral and contrary to <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=scujil">peremptory</a> legal <a style="cursor: help" title="These include expectations of Natural Law, which represent the original and core legal foundations of the United States. Natural Law is based upon the acceptance of certain principles of right and justice that prevail because of their own intrinsic merit. Eternal and immutable, they are external to all acts of human will and interpenetrate all human reason. This dynamic idea and its attendant tradition of human civility runs continuously from Mosaic Law and the ancient Greeks and Romans to the present day. For a comprehensive and far-reaching assessment of the natural law origins of international law, see Louis René Beres, 'Justice and Realpolitik: International Law and the Prevention of Genocide,' The American Journal of Jurisprudence, Vol. 33, 1988, pp. 123-159. This article was adapted from Professor Beres' earlier presentation at the International Conference on the Holocaust and Genocide, Tel-Aviv, Israel, June 1982.">expectations</a>.

"Each state," recognized William Blackstone back in the eighteenth century, "is expected to aid and enforce the law of <a style="cursor: help" title="See Blackstone's Commentaries on the Law of England (1765). These deservedly famous Commentaries represent the literal and historical foundation of United States law. No other single document is comparably important to the original development of American jurisprudence.">nations</a>."

Worrisome conclusions about Trumpian "realism" are both evident and irrefutable. Among other things, they offer an elucidating summation of binding and correspondingly timeless principles of human legal cooperation. Always, but now more than ever before - now, as America suffers previously unimaginable leadership derelictions - many of the usual policy urgencies must be revised. Now, it must quickly be understood, a commonly felt agony has become more fundamental to human survival and law-based coexistence than any more ritually standard accumulations of fact.

There is more. Today, as we may learn from contemporary European thinker E.M. Cioran, "...a cry of <a style="cursor: help" title="See E.M. Cioran, On the Heights of Despair (The University of Chicago Press, 1992).">despair</a> is more revealing than the most subtle thought; and tears always have deeper roots than smiles."

Despair is ubiquitous. Accordingly, there is much more for us to consider and continually reevaluate. "Yes," for certain, our American national policies must be based upon competently gathered facts and on a correlative body of <a style="cursor: help" title="On this indispensable theory-based foundation, we may consider the analogy that theories are 'nets.' This elucidating metaphor is correctly attributable to the German poet Novalis, and is cited by Karl Popper as the epigraph to his classic text, The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959). The poet's exact words, according to Popper, are: 'Theories are nets; only he who casts, will catch.' Significantly, in Donald Trump's White House, no one is casting.">theory</a> and science.

But something else is also <a style="cursor: help" title="Prophetically, almost as if he were speaking directly to current era Trump-induced policy deformations, French Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin warned back in the mid-1950s: 'So says science, and I believe in science.

<em>Quo Vadis</em>? Where should we go from here? It follows, among other things, that for the United States to continue blithely with Donald Trump's law-challenging policies of belligerent nationalism would represent a dire choice and prescription. This would mean accepting a manifestly futile plan to further neglect a world already caught up in the suffocating throes of planet-wide <a style="cursor: help" title="Consider in this regard a pertinent poetic voice from William Butler Yeats: 'There is no longer a virtuous nation, and the best of us live by candlelight.' Prima facie, these conspicuous elements of decline include various norms and expectations of law.">declensions</a>.

Though it may sound like an exaggeration, such an existential expectation is no longer just hyperbole or rhetorical contrivance. It reflects, instead, a plausible outcome of manifestly corrosive national policies operating "against the grain" in an interdependent and asymmetrical world. More specifically, the conspicuously shallow and degrading Trump vision of "America First" could only lead the United States toward endlessly Darwinian global struggles and to an eventual <a style="cursor: help" title="Though composed back in the seventeenth century, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan still offers an illuminating and enduring vision of chaos in world politics and world law. Says the English philosopher in Chapter XIII, 'Of the Naturall Condition of Mankind, as concerning their Felicity, and Misery:' during chaos, a condition which Hobbes identifies as a 'time of Warre,' it is a time '...where every man is Enemy to every man... and where the life of man is solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.' At the time of writing, Hobbes believed that the condition of 'nature' in world politics was less chaotic than that same condition existing among individual human beings - because of what he called the 'dreadful equality' of individual men in nature being able to kill others - but this once-relevant differentiation has effectively disappeared with the global spread of nuclear weapons.">chaos</a>. Here, amid fiercely crude competitions between nation-states, we would necessarily expect more and more stubbornly refractory global <a style="cursor: help" title="Presumptively, the worst case conflict outcome would be some form of a nuclear war. On the plausibly expected consequences of such a war, see by this author, Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: U.S. Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1984); Louis René Beres, Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Lexington, Mass., Lexington Books, 1986); and most recently, Louis René Beres, Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; 2nd ed., 2018).">conflicts</a>.

In these fully conceivable circumstances, the barbaric standard of "everyone for himself" would produce more and more intense levels of profound human suffering. <em>Ipso facto</em>, such unhappy results would reflect tangibly wide deviations from all assorted legal obligations, most notably the statutory and customary obligations of national and international <a style="cursor: help" title="These deviations would concern both national and international law, especially as the latter is inherently a part of the former. In the words used by the U.S. Supreme Court in The Paquete Habana, 'International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination. For this purpose, where there is no treaty, and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the customs and usages of civilized nations.">law</a>.

Once again, we are obliged to ask: Where should we go from such a narrowly inauspicious decisional precipice? Significantly, in our war and disease-ravaged world, a world already teetering at the most vertiginous "heights of despair," only a law-based expansion of human empathy could still possibly save us. This suggests, <em>inter alia</em>, that any such expansion by the United States would represent not just some altruistic or generously unreciprocated act of charity - that is, a mistakenly one-sided species of "traditional" American <a style="cursor: help" title="We are speaking here of exercising some naive expression of noblesse oblige in international statecraft.">benevolence</a> - but rather a simultaneously positive and self-serving expression of rational US policy.

The reasons? They are actually all quite clear. In very brief summation, US national interests can no longer be served at the calculably deliberate and zero-sum expense of certain other states and nations. <em>Period</em>.

There is more. At every crucial level of evaluation, military, economic and biological, American security is integrally linked with a much wider "<a style="cursor: help" title="In somewhat similar fashion to his Swiss acolyte and colleague, Carl G. Jung, Sigmund Freud often spoke imaginatively of 'souls.' He had early understood, even in the vortex of his own professed atheism, that a well-placed mystery of eternity hovers meaningfully above and beyond our tangibly temporal world. Accordingly, as Freud plainly knew, the very deepest realities of human feeling and empathy can never be properly elucidated through science. Nonetheless, Freud's modern critics, generally lacking his more subtle understandings of serious learning, foolishly fault him for being 'unscientific.'">human soul</a>." Accordingly, for the United States, any further misplaced confidence in vacant presidential witticisms or contrived "smiles" could <em>fatally</em> undermine this country's historical benevolence and its overall security. Though, until now, any such open reference to US national morbidity would have seemed a gross exaggeration, this is no longer true.

We are now in mortal danger, both individually and collectively.

What we are witnessing today, hour by hour, minute by minute, is the incremental dismantling of a once preeminent and decent world power. Once again, in world history, an immutable element of <em>transience</em> has become tragically self-evident.

In all candor, during their Trump-based and pandemic-hastened decline, the American "<a style="cursor: help" title="In the clarifying words of Swiss psychologist and philosopher Carl G. Jung: 'The mass crushes out the insight and reflection that are still possible with the individual, and this necessarily leads to doctrinaire and authoritarian tyranny if ever the constitutional State should succumb to a fit of weakness.' (See, The Undiscovered Self, 1957).">mass</a>" can hardly cling convincingly to this president's contrived promises of "greatness." At best, the childishly-inscribed red hats represent an embarrassingly thin parody of genuine <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, we may recall Bertrand Russell's warning in Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916): 'Men fear thought more than they fear anything else on earth, more than ruin, more even than death.' This observation is now especially valid in reference to Donald Trump's arguably anesthetized 'base.'">thinking</a>, a demonstrably hideous caricature. For the foreseeable future, lest we forget the unchanging lessons of transience in world affairs, we will need to settle not for "greatness," but for elementary physical survival.

All this is hardly reassuring or comforting. But Trumpian false reassurance is assuredly not what we must seek. Truth is exculpatory. And this particular truth about America's mortal vulnerabilities is not subject to any credible contradictions.

<em>None at all</em>.

There is more. For the United States, today's national and geopolitical truth is expectedly grim and undeniably sobering. Even worse, there are no discoverable correctives visible anywhere on this bewildered administration's law-violating policy horizons. On the contrary, the "medicine" offered by a persistently defiling Trump administration is merely more and more of the <a style="cursor: help" title="One may be reminded here of the appropriately illuminating comment by playwright Samuel Beckett (Endgame): 'What is the good of passing from one untenable position to another, of seeking justification always on the same plane?'">same</a>.

Nothing else is being offered, whether it might concern threats of war, <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, war and genocide need not be mutually exclusive. Rather, war might represent the 'tactical' means whereby a particular genocide is actually undertaken. According to Articles II and III of the Genocide Convention, which entered into force on January 12, 1951, genocide includes any of several listed acts 'committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group as such...' See CONVENTION ON THE PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE CRIME OF GENOCIDE, Done at New York, Dec. 9, 1948. Entered into force, Jan. 12, 1951. 78 U.N.T.S. 277.">genocide</a>, terror and/or planet-wide pandemic.

The finding of regularities constitutes the beginning of any scientific inquiry. Apropos of this understanding, there is a commonly core problem here. Most fundamentally injurious and ominous about Donald Trump's studied indifference to human interconnections and properly codified legal rights is his willful destruction of empathy. For any still-thinking Americans, the palpably dreadful consequences of such relentless destruction ought already have become obvious. The unmistakably monstrous global consequences of "Germany First" - a readily recognizable antecedent of Trump's "America First" - should immediately exhibit painfully stinging historical <a style="cursor: help" title="Observed Sigmund Freud in his lesser-known work on Woodrow Wilson: 'Fools, visionaries, sufferers from delusions, neurotics and lunatics have played great roles at all times in the history of mankind, and not merely when the accident of birth had bequeathed them sovereignty. Usually, they have wreaked havoc.'">resonances</a>.

Still, for any necessary expansions of empathy to become sufficiently practical would first require a president and a citizenry at least minimally versed in history and law.

And there are other even deeper roots to rudimentary American deficiencies of empathy and cooperation. Divided into thousands of hostile tribes, almost two hundred of which are called "nation-states," too many human beings now find it easy or even pleasing to slay "<a style="cursor: help" title="See, for example, Ernest Becker, Escape From Evil (New York: The Free Press, 1975), p. 2. In a similar vein, says Otto Rank in his Will Therapy and Reality: 'The death fear of the ego is lessened by the killing, the Sacrifice, of the other; through the death of the other, one buys oneself free from the penalty of dying, of being killed.'">others</a>." As for any remediating considerations of compassionate human feeling, that particular sort of commendable sentiment is typically reserved only for those who live within one’s own expressly delineated "tribe."

Nonetheless, looking ahead, any expansion of empathy to include "outsiders" remains a genuinely basic condition of law-based peace and a viable global union. Without such a needed expansion, our entire species would remain very inconveniently dedicated to its own continuous debasement and, by extrapolation, to its own incremental <a style="cursor: help" title="'Is it an end that draws near,' asked postwar German philosopher Karl Jaspers in his Man in the Modern Age (1951) 'or a beginning?'">disappearance</a>.

Understanding this particular bit of geopolitical wisdom ought already have become a helpful corrective to amply debilitating Trump nonsense of "America First." Among other things, this poorly resurrected political mantra has been eerily reminiscent of America's sordid "Know Nothing" <a style="cursor: help" title="Still the best treatments of America's long-term disinterest in anything intellectual are Richard Hofstadter, Anti-intellectualism in American Life (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1964); and Jacques Barzun, The House of Intellect (Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 1959).">history</a>. "I love the poorly educated," said candidate Donald Trump in 2016. "Intellect rots the brain," advised Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels at the Nuremberg rallies of 1934 and 1935.

Incontestably, the two separate but side-by-side assertions are the product of soiled kindred spirits. In essence, let us be candid, even if well-intentioned and unintended, "America First" represents Donald Trump's cynically Americanized version of "<em>Deutschland uber alles</em>." Like Goebbels, we have assuredly now seen, this president likes (nay, loves) his incoherent and dissembling "rallies."

We need functioning remedies to all such contemptible histories. But what fixes, if any, remain plausible? What must Americans actually do to encourage a wider pattern of empathy, and thereby foster more deeply caring feelings between as well as within "tribes"? How can a U.S. president work to improve the state of our rapidly crumbling world legal order so as to best ensure a dignified future for us all?

These are not easy questions, but they do need to be asked. Incontestably, they represent the precise queries that will finally need to be addressed openly by Donald Trump or (much more hopefully) by a well-prepared successor.

Ironically, as we must initially acknowledge, the essential expansion of empathy for the many could quickly become “dreadful,” possibly improving human community, but only at the intolerable costs of private sanity. This prospectively insufferable consequence is deeply rooted in the way we humans were originally "designed," that is, as more-or-less "hard wired" beings, individuals with distinctly recognizable and largely "impermeable" boundaries of personal feeling.

Were it otherwise, an extended range of compassion toward too many others would inevitably bring about our own emotional collapse. As an easy to understand example, consider how difficult it would be if all of us were suddenly to feel the same compelling pangs of sympathy and compassion for certain others outside our primary spheres of attachment that we already have for family and friends located "inside" this sphere.

Intellectually, this challenge presents a challenging paradox. It was already examined long ago, in the ancient Jewish legend of the <em>Lamed-Vov</em>, a Talmudic tradition that certain scholars trace back to Isaiah. Here, the whole world is said to rest upon thirty-six Just Men, the <em>Lamed-Vov</em>. Along normal criteria of differentiation, these figures are otherwise indistinguishable from ordinary mortals.

Still, if just one of their number were somehow absent, the resultant sufferings of humankind would then become staggering, perhaps even poisoning the souls of the newly-born.

This Talmud-explained paradox has potentially useful contemporary meaning for the United States. This modernized signification reveals that a widening circle of human compassion is both indispensable to civilizational survival and also represents a promising source of private anguish.

According to the Jewish legend, such overwhelming anguish would literally be unimaginable.

Still more questions must be raised. How shall President Trump or his successor begin to deal capably with a requirement for global civilization that is both essential and unbearable? Newly informed that empathy for the many is a precondition for any decent and functioning world legal order, what can create such caring without simultaneously producing intolerable emotional pain? Recalling Ralph Waldo Emerson and the American Transcendentalists, remaining "high-thinkers" must now duly inquire: How can we quickly be released from the misconceived ideology of "America First," a deranging posture that has been increasing the prospects not only of <a style="cursor: help" title="See especially: RESOLUTION ON THE DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION, Dec. 14, 1974, U.N.G.A. Res. 3314 (XXIX), 29 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 31) 142, U.N. Doc. A/9631, 1975, reprinted in 13 I.L.M. 710, 1974; and CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, Art. 51.. Done at San Francisco, June 26, 1945. Entered into force for the United States, Oct. 24, 1945, 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993, Bevans 1153, 1976, Y.B.U.N. 1043.">aggression</a>, <a style="cursor: help" title="Under authoritative international law, terrorist movements are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.' See: Research in International Law: Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime, 29 AM J. INT'L L. (Supp 1935) 435, 566 (quoting King v. Marsh (1615), 3 Bulstr. 27, 81 Eng. Rep 23 (1615)('a pirate est Hostes humani generis')).">terrorism</a> and genocide, but also of an uncontrolled disease pandemic?

There is more. The whole world, the world <em>in toto</em>, is a <em>system</em>. "The existence of system in the world is at once obvious to every observer of nature," says the Jesuit philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, "no matter whom...Each element of the Cosmos is positively woven from all the others..."

Above all, this president or his successor must fully and finally understand that the state of America's national union can never be any better than the state of the wider and always deeply intersecting world. This key truth now obtains not "only" in traditional reference to the enduring issues of war, peace and law-based human rights, but also to urgently critical matters of disease avoidance.

Always, for the imperiled United States, the overarching presidential objective must be to protect the sacred dignity and law-based rights of each and every individual <a style="cursor: help" title="Says José Ortega y' Gasset, the Spanish existentialist philosopher: 'Each of us is both the subject and the protagonist of his own nontransferable life.' (Man and Crisis, 1958).">human being</a>. It is exactly this high-minded and ancient goal that should now give preeminent policy direction to a bewildered and bewildering American President. <em>Inter alia</em>, such indisputably good counsel could represent a law-based corrective to Trump's continuously misleading endorsements of "America First."

Naturally, it will be easy for many to dismiss any such seemingly lofty recommendations for human dignity and legal obligation as silly, ethereal or "academic." But, in reality, there could never be any greater American presidential naiveté than to champion the patently false extremities of "everyone for himself."

Among Trump's other egregious misunderstandings and falsifications, "America First" represents a sorely blemished presidential mantra. Devoid of empathy, intellect, and absolutely all principal obligations of human legal <a style="cursor: help" title="International law remains a 'vigilante' system, or, in other words, 'Westphalian.' This reference is to the Peace Of Westphalia (1648), which concluded the Thirty Years War, and created the now still-existing decentralized, or self-help, state system. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.">cooperation</a>, it can lead only toward distressingly new heights of strife, disharmony and collective despair. Left intact and unrevised, "America First" would point us all directly toward a potentially irreversible <em>vita minima</em>; that is, toward badly corrupted personal lives emptied of themselves - meaningless, shattered, rancorous, unfeeling and radically unstable.

Here, located among so many other corollary melodramas and misfortunes, we would find it impossible to battle not just the usual adversaries involving violence, but also our increasingly fearful biological/pathogen-centered enemies.

There is more. Without a suitable expansion of empathy, we Americans will remain at the mercy not just of other predatory human beings, but also of certain exceedingly virulent pathogens. Progressively, the harmful synergies created by such dangerous combinations would sometime likely become too much to bear.

For all, the cumulative lesson should be clear. We are all part of the very same planetary whole. Only by placing "Humanity First" can an American president truly make "<a style="cursor: help" title="A properly antecedent question was raised earlier by Jose Ortega y' Gasset in 1925: 'Where,' the Spanish philosopher queried, 'shall we find the material to reconstruct the world?' See Ortega's The Dehumanization of Art (1925)(1968) by Princeton University Press, p. 129.">America First</a>." The latter placement, which must now include the capacity to combat disease pandemics as well as <a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, states must judge every use of force twice: once with regard to the underlying right to wage war (jus ad bellum) and once to the means used in conducting a war (jus in bello). Following the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 and the United Nations Charter, there can be absolutely no right to aggressive war. However, the long-standing customary right of post-attack self-defense remains codified at Article 51 of the UN Charter. Similarly, subject to conformance, inter alia, with jus in bello criteria, certain instances of humanitarian intervention and collective security operations may also be consistent with jus ad bellum. The law of war, the rules of jus in bello, comprise: (1) laws on weapons; (2) laws on warfare; and (3) humanitarian rules. Codified primarily at the Hague and Geneva Conventions, these rules attempt to bring discrimination, proportionality and military necessity into all belligerent calculations.">war</a>, terrorism and genocide, is simply not possible without the former. Today, the "cosmopolitan" reason behind this key conclusion remains entirely valid and largely unchanged.

Looking ahead, it really all boils down to this: <em>What does not benefit the world as a whole ("the hive") can be of no enduring benefit to the United States ("the bee")</em>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>There is a pertinent need to find a balance between free speech and the impact of fake news on a citizen’s safety.</em>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently <a href="https://abc7news.com/cdc-coronavirus-corona-virus-misinformation-about-caronavorus/5989971/">stated</a> that world governments are fighting a battle on two fronts, Covid-19 and the large influx of information regarding the pandemic which have been called ‘infodemics’ by some. This flow of information provides an opportunity for misinformation and false news to spread quickly. With the advent of digital resources and a lesser reliance on print media, false news is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30461-X/fulltext">spreading</a> at an alarming pace, by virtue of a click or even a simple ‘forward’. It then becomes necessary for the Government to take regulatory measures to control the spread of such misinformation. Curbing fake news while protecting the freedom of speech and expression at the same time is no easy task and at a time when the world is reeling at the feet of a deadly virus such as this, the lines between the two are further blurred.

This article purports to examine the impact fake news has on people, strongly affecting one’s critical thinking and their ability to make informed decisions. It further highlights the need to have regulatory measures to curb fake news and the conflict in doing so within free speech jurisprudence. India’s existing model to contain the spread of misinformation and false news has been contrasted with other nations while also being checked for consistency with international human rights standards.

<strong>Infodemics in India</strong>

In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India in <em>Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India</em> recognized the problem of infodemics in India and passed an order asking the State governments to comply with the directions issued by the Centre to curb the menace of fake news. The apex court further <a href="https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2020/3/31/coronavirus-covid-19-food-is-being-provided-to-over-22-lakh-migrant-workers-centre-tells-sc/">emphasized</a> on the need to have a daily bulletin issued by the Government of India through all media avenues as a source of real time verified information regarding Covid-19 in a bid to counter the panic and apprehension caused by the uncontrolled flow of fake news and surrounding misinformation. In this petition, it was pointed out that the recent mass exodus of migrant workers was triggered by the apprehension created in the minds of the laborers due to fake news that exaggerated the duration of the lockdown to last for more than 3 months. This exit brought about by the spread of unauthorized information <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/29/covid-19-lockdown-migrant-worker-who-walked-from-delhi-to-mp-dies-80-km-from-home.html">resulted</a> in the deaths of poor migrant laborers who were finding their way home.

More cases of fake news have been prevailing in India during this lockdown period, leading the police to arrest people across the country. In <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/fake-news-real-arrests/">Mizoram</a>, the police arrested about 15 people for spreading fake circulars asking people staying outside the state to return back to their homes. In <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/odisha-32-year-old-held-spreading-fake-news-coronavirus-social-media-1655623-2020-03-14">Odisha</a>, fake news circulated through WhatsApp claimed that a person who came from outside the state was infected. The matter was found to be false after the police conducted an investigation. At the moment India does not have any dedicated legislation to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/17/fake-news-real-arrests/">regulate</a> fake news, this pandemic is providing clarity as to why we need one.

<strong>Fake News V. Free Speech: The Indian Legal Set-up</strong>

<strong>Information Technology Act, 2008 (IT Act)</strong>

In India, social media platforms, <a href="https://www.hyderabadpolice.gov.in/acts/ITAct2000-2008(amendment).pdf">identified</a> under Section 2(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2008 as 'intermediaries’ under Section 79(2)(c) are expected to follow due diligence while carrying out their duties. Initially, under the Act and as per the rules <a href="https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/in/in098en.pdf">codified</a> in April 2011, a liability for intermediaries did not arise if they were not responsible for inception, transmission and reception of such content through their networks. Consequently, this move provided intermediaries with immunity which ensured that they were lax about curbing fake news.

Upon realizing its mistake, the government rendered a solution at the other end of the spectrum i.e., to direct intermediaries to proactively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html">censor</a> content. These measures have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/india-internet-censorship.html">compared</a> to Chinese style censorship. This can be used as a political weapon by the government to censor content that does not benefit them. Such a measure would be detrimental to free speech. In comparison with the landmark <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-210d4e9.pdf">judgement</a> in <em>United States v. Alvarez</em> where it was held that free speech, counter speech and refutation can overcome a lie, the measure of the Indian Government would be a far cry from the protection of free speech. The discourse should flow naturally and not along a doctored route.

<strong>Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA)</strong>

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/640589/">Section 54</a> of the DMA purports to deal with ‘false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic’ and this has been applied while recording arrests so far. It makes the offence punishable with imprisonment up to 1 year and the imposition of a fine. However, the same provision has been long criticized for being very specific to disasters at a time when the scope of fake news is much wider.

Although Covid-19 has been declared a disaster which allows the enforcement of this provision, the ability of the Act to curb fake news does not extend beyond the period of such a disaster. While this unique feature of the Act limits its application only to a period of disasters, there is a resultant positive outcome as well. It does not allow the employment of this provision to outlive the exceptional circumstances of a disaster, thereby ensuring that it is not manipulated by the Government to further enforce restraint on free speech.

<strong>Indian Penal Code (IPC) </strong>

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/360749/">Section 505(1)(b)</a> of the IPC deals with the spreading of false and mischievous content that results in fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or public tranquility. The offender under this section can be punished with imprisonment of a maximum of 6 years and a fine. Section 505(1)(b) coupled with Section 54 of the DMA have been envisioned to contain the spread of fake news to a large extent.

However, the real problem of fake news is false content that comes in the form of unpaid stories and is disguised as real news. Pressing civil or criminal liability on fake news propagators would <a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5613&amp;context=flr">require</a> a finding of actual malice, which would not be viable for fake news shared by many such unknown sources on the internet. The malice standard could be circumvented and strict liability could be imposed on the propagator of false information along with exemplary damages. However, the imposition of strict liability would require tracing the misinformation back to its source which has been acknowledged to be a troublesome process and not often an efficient one. Additionally, this mandate would not necessarily dissuade publishers from manufacturing false information and would not be able to undo the harm caused by a horde of social media users believing the content and acting on it.

It is not unknown that following an approach sticking strictly to legal machinery would be dangerous and ineffective. This calls for self-regulation where we ought to be more sophisticated <a href="https://ifex.org/regulations-are-a-bigger-threat-than-fake-news/">consumers</a> of news with an increased focus on the need to critically assess what we read. Awareness programs aimed at media literacy with emphasis on the importance of fact checking are needed. When sources of fake news outnumber the sources of their legitimate counterparts, fact checking often becomes a troublesome and onerous process. Additionally, daily press briefings by health officials coupled with public announcements to counter misinformation and regularly updated statistics would constitute efficient countermeasures in response to the propagation of false news.

<strong>Curbing Fake News within the Free Speech Jurisprudence </strong>

International Human Rights Law <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/19/human-rights-dimensions-covid-19-response">recognizes</a> that in the context of serious public health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified. The scale and severity of the Covid-19 pandemic rises to the level of a public health threat which justifies the restrictions on freedom of speech and expression. However, such restrictions have to be consistent with the <a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/our-work/4-permissible-limitations-iccpr-right-freedom-expression">principles</a> of international human rights law. The same has been enshrined under Article 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which requires the limitations to have a legal basis, to be strictly necessary, to be subject to review and to be proportionate to achieve the objective.

While it is necessary to take measures in order to contain the spread of misinformation, there is a flip side to this. The efforts to counter fake news could <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/countering-fake-news-while-safeguarding-free-speech/a-37924278">lead</a> to censorship laws being imposed, or the suppression of critical thoughts that are required to make informed decisions. Recently, the Thailand Government, in a bid to contain the spread of misinformation, adopted <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/thailand-emergency-measures-threaten-human-rights/">measures</a> that included a blanket ban on communications that are either ‘false’ or ‘misleading.' Under this measure, the Thai Government <a href="https://pen.org/press-release/thai-artist-arrested-for-posting-about-countrys-lackluster-coronavirus-screening/">arrested</a> an artist who criticized the Government’s response to the public health crisis at hand. This provides substantiation to the argument that emergency measures undertaken to curb fake news could be misused by the Government to flagrantly violate the freedom of speech and expression and access to information, by muffling any voice of dissent or criticism against the Government.

In the days since the pandemic began the Indian government has taken a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/disingenuous-and-no-antidote/article31324860.ece">stance</a> on its ill-planned operations and has condemned such criticisms on these operations as fake news. In the case of the migrant laborers’ exodus and the resultant deaths, the Government failed to account for them and the entirety of the blame was cast on the propagation of fake news. Even though misinformation played a large part in exaggerating the lockdown time period, equal blame has to be shouldered by the Government for the ill-planned measures it executed.

Proactive censorship is now taking hold in India with the Maharashtra Government <a href="http://www.lexplosion.in/maharashtra-health-ministry-gives-immediate-effect-to-covid-19-regulations-casts-obligations-on-organisations-persons-and-health-care-facilities-hcfs-additional-containment-measures-implemented-i/">notifying</a> its people that no information regarding Covid-19 is to be propagated through digital or print media without obtaining clearance from authorized officials. This imposition of prior restraint not only restricts public discourse but also eliminates it since the lack of knowledge of credible information leads to the absence of informed questioning.

Complete transparency about the spread of the virus along with unfettered dissemination of accurate public information so as to spread awareness on this subject will be crucial during this crisis. Furthermore, there have been suggestions to lay down parameters that would measure the factual basis or the truth value of a story. However, this raises questions as to who should be the ones defining and measuring this. Allowing the Government to do so would put people at the risk of not being able to voice any sort of criticism against the Government. Moreover, having one single body maintain a monopoly over the manufacture of truth that is propagated in the society, is highly undesirable for the democratic functioning of any nation.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

It is imperative that fake news be curbed during this crisis. However, it should not be at the expense of free speech. The way forward in cutting down free speech is temporary measures, measures that in the short run take away certain freedoms, but in the long run does not turn out to be a political weapon for any ruling government. Temporary measures will enable the government to make changes to the existing system in order to protect us. In our vulnerable moment we should let the government protect us, but it should not result in the government exploiting our vulnerability. The government needs to work with the public and the intermediaries to control the rapid spread of fake news. It is vital that we do so, otherwise fake news might prove to be the pandemic’s equal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic is exposing the devastating public health and socio-economic consequences of legalized discrimination in the United States. In many ways for the Black community, this pandemic has become a microcosm of the Black experience in America. Centuries of systemic racism put Blacks at greater <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-why-african-americans-vulnerable-covid-19-health-race">risk</a> of mortality from COVID-19 while also being more likely to live in dense segregated housing susceptible to community spread, work in low-wage high-risk occupations on the frontline, or own a shuttered small business that can’t access critical stimulus bank loans. Today, we are witnessing the life and death costs of institutional racism in America play out in real-time.

It has long been argued that the best way to get over racism in America is to stop talking about race. Some argue that focusing on race in America foments racism and bigotry in our society. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has called this theory into question by <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/825730141/the-coronavirus-doesnt-discriminate-but-u-s-health-care-showing-familiar-biases">revealing</a> stark racial disparities in treatment, testing, and death rates that have resulted in unimaginable tragedy for Black people across the United States.

In recent weeks, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>), following the lead of local governments, began collecting identifying data on individuals who were testing positive in order to engage in contact tracing and better understand the virus. The data immediately revealed that mortality rates for Black people were disproportionate to their percentage of the population. Across the country urban areas with large Black populations have been <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/coronavirus-medical-racism">decimated</a> by the pandemic.

In St. Louis, nearly all of the deaths <a href="http://www.stlamerican.com/your_health_matters/covid_19/all-12-covid-19-deaths-in-the-city-of-st-louis-were-black/article_da7ed56c-79d1-11ea-85bc-7b8539eaf346.html">attributed</a> to COVID-19 were Black victims. By the middle of April in Chicago, Black people <a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/news-stories/chicago-70-percent-covid-19-deaths-black/">were</a> seventy percent of the deaths. In Milwaukee County, Blacks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/covid-19-is-ravaging-black-communities-a-milwaukee-neighborhood-is-figuring-out-how-to-fight-back/2020/04/06/1ae56730-7714-11ea-ab25-4042e0259c6d_story.html">account</a> for more than half of all COVID-19 cases. In Georgia, Blacks <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/coronavirus-impact-on-black-georgians-may-get-worse-fast.html">account</a> for eighty percent of hospitalizations and sixty-two percent of COVID deaths. Many keen observers have been noting that Black people are more likely to bear the socio-economic brunt of COVID-19 when the pandemic was originally thought to be a great equalizer of sorts.

The media narrative <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/8/21213383/coronavirus-black-americans-trump-administration-high-covid-19-death-rate">draws</a> attention to the presence of comorbidities in poor Black communities without proper context of how we arrived at this precarious juncture. The reason the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionately impacting Black people is America’s legacy of legalized discrimination that was codified in the law by the Supreme Court of the United States.

Blacks in America have long harbored a deep mistrust of traditional Western medicine and medical investigation. This lack of trust is borne out of racially biased healthcare practitioners, lower rates of insurance coverage, and a history of being subjects to unethical race-based medical research, such as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">Tuskegee</a> Experiment. The combination of distrust and discrimination results in Black men having the worst health outcomes of any group in the US, being less likely than their white counterparts to seek medical treatment, and more likely to die prematurely.

This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/upshot/race-and-medicine-the-harm-that-comes-from-mistrust.html">lack</a> of trust presents a perfect storm in the face of a global pandemic that can’t be eradicated without widespread testing, treatment and cooperation with the medical community. While this lack of trust must be addressed, it is important that we also ensure Blacks have equal access to testing and treatment free of racial bias and regardless of health insurance coverage.

Numerous reports from around the country have highlighted stories of Blacks being <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/04/20/coronavirus-racial-disparity-denied-tests-hospitalization/5163056002/">turned</a> away from testing centers or hospitals when seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19. Some would suggest the impact of COVID-19 on the Black community is a function of lifestyle choices such as poor diet, substance abuse, or other high-risk behaviors. This point of view absolves the system that is most responsible for these health disparities and places the onus on those who have been victims of a legally discriminatory health care system.

In what is known as The <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/109us3">Civil Rights Cases</a>, SCOTUS ruled that racial discrimination that impacts every individual the same or that is privatized is legal and outside the boundaries of the Civil Rights <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/recon/civilrightsact.html">Act</a>. That is to say that if a pool owner closes a local pool because he does not want Black people to have access, that discrimination is allowed because no one, including White people, is allowed to access. Additionally, SCOTUS has continually ruled that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xbyax/most-black-kids-cant-swim-its-not-just-a-stereotype-its-history">private</a> institutions are able to create their own rules for membership and accommodations, even if said rules are on the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2596907/cornelius-v-benevolent-protective-order-of-elks/">basis</a> of race. These rulings resulted in the direct exclusion of Black people from financing from banks, quality health care, excellent public education, healthy food, and fair housing as many institutions privatized or relocated away from Black areas. The 1976 Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-1492">decision</a> <u>Washington v. Davis</u> further complicated things by establishing that laws with a racially discriminatory effect were legal and constitutional as long they were not created with a discriminatory purpose.

The current public health and socio-economic crises present an opportunity to begin to dismantle the infrastructure of legalized discrimination in the United States. If anything, this critical moment provides us with a clear understanding of the far-reaching devastation caused by the systemic racism that <a href="https://www.publichealthpost.org/research/rating-health-after-redlining/">created</a> the environment for this virus to wreak havoc in every corner of the US. As we begin to rid our country of this disease, we must be committed to addressing the root causes of the chilling inequality we are witnessing before our eyes. Not only will we save lives today, but we will forge a safer, healthier, and more equitable future for those who have faced a legacy of legal systemic discrimination in every area of American life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“There is a view point that post retirement appointment is itself a scar on the judicial independence of the Judiciary. In fact this is valid and strong point.” - former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi</blockquote>
This was the <em>obiter dicta</em> of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi while hearing 18 petitions related to challenges to the laws governing quasi judicial tribunals. In just a year after making such statement, Ranjan Gogoi has been nominated to Rajya Sabha. This is not first time in the history of Indian courts, that a retired justice has been awarded post-retirement benefits, but as said by Justice Madan Lokur in a recent article, several wrongs of the past do not make this decision right. In the final year of his tenure, Justice Gogoi was involved in many important judgments including the <em>Ram Janmabhoomi</em> Case and the <em>Rafale Deal</em>. For the first time in history, an acting CJI was accused of sexual harassment charges. There are many recent incidents which shake the trust of citizens in the judiciary including choices made in selecting urgent cases amid lockdown and the procrastinating view point of judiciary towards clear violations of fundamentals rights in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The independence of the judiciary has been challenged again and again in the recent past and this third pillar of the democracy has every time proved to be baffled.

<strong>Independence of the Judiciary</strong>

The Constitution of India, unlike the USA, does not follow the doctrine of Separation of Powers, but it has been reiterated in many cases that the independence of the judiciary is a basic part of the constitution. For the judiciary to be independent and impartial to serve the constitutional goals, the Judges need to act fairly, reasonably, free of any fear and favor. The judiciary stands between the citizen and the State as a rampart against misuse or abuse of power by the executive. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for the judiciary to be free from executive pressure or influence that has been provided in various provisions of the Constitution.

The independence is not limited only from executive pressure or influence, but also from any other pressure and prejudices. It has many dimensions, fearlessness of other power centres, economic or political. Impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in decision-making are the hallmarks of the judiciary. If “impartiality” is the soul of the judiciary, “independence” is its lifeblood. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive. It is the independence of judicial thought. It is the freedom from interference and pressures which provides the judicial atmosphere where a judge can work with absolute commitment to the cause of justice and constitutional values. Its existence depends, however, not only on philosophical, ethical or moral aspects but also upon several mundane things namely security in tenure, freedom from ordinary monetary worries, freedom from influences and pressures within (from others in the judiciary) and without (from the executive). Independence of the judiciary is a part of its basic structure. The constitutional ethos of an independent judiciary cannot be permitted to be diluted by acts of implied intervention or undue interference by the executive in the impartial administration of justice, directly or indirectly.

<strong>Previous instance of judges being appointed post-retirement</strong>

Justice Ranjan Gogoi is not the first Chief justice to accept post retirement benefits from the government. Justice Ranganath Mishra retired as CJI in 1991 was appointed as the Chairman of the National Human Rights Commisssion and later after some years was sent to Rajya Sabha on the Indian National Congress’s ticket. Justice P. Sathasivam was appointed as the governer of Kerala after his retirement in the first regime of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in 2014. Justice M. C. Chagla, Chief justice of Bombay high court was appointed as Ambassador to the US and then High Commissioner to the UK an then appointed as Minister of Education and subsequently of External Affairs in Nehru’s regime. Justice M. Hidayatullah retired as CJI in 1970 was elected as Vice-President of India. Justice Baharul Islam was Member of Parliament from Rajya Sabha then he became a Judge of the Supreme Court and then again became MP of Rajya Sabha.

<strong>Post Retirement Appointments in Other Countries</strong>

In the USA, the tenure of judges is lifetime. Therefore no question of post retirement appointments arises. The reason is to provide judges with job security so that they can work according to the law and free from any kind of fear. In the USA, even the president cannot diminish the compensation of the federal judges. This is to exclude executive and legislative interference.

In the United Kingdom, the situation is much like India, but in contrast, there is no law to stop them from assuming any position after completing their services. Many retired judges become crossbench peers. In fact, the current convenor is also a retired Chief Justice of England and Wales.

<strong>Suggestions to Maintain Reliability in the Judiciary</strong>

A certain cooling off period should be imposed, which needs to be completed before reinstating any public office. It will make sure that there were no political or executive involvements in decision-making of the judge. In my opinion, the cooling off period should be at least 10 years so as to make sure that 2 terms of the Lok Sabha are completed, which will mitigate the chances of external interference.

In India remuneration of judges is far less compared to other countries, this is considered to be a reason that almost all judges after retirement get involved in some kind of activity for financial gain, some in the private sector and some in the public. Increasing the salary and pension of judges may mitigate their involvement in the financial sector, but this is not a reliable solution because greed has no end.

<strong>Critical Analysis of Recent Post-Retirement Appointments and Demeaning incidents</strong>

Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi was nominated to Rajya Sabha after less than 6 months of his retirement. In the last year of his tenure, he was involved in many crucial judgments including the <em>Rafale Deal</em> case, the <em>Ayodhya</em> case and the <em>Assam NRC</em> case, which were directly connected to the then-BJP led government and more importantly all the judgments were ruled in the way that the government wanted. The former CJI P. Sathasivam was appointed as Governor of Kerala within 6 months of the start of his retirement. He was lead of the bench that dismissed the second First Information Report (FIR) against Amit Shah in the fake encounter <em>Sohrabuddin Sheikh</em> case. These appointments totally question the credibility as well as independence of the judiciary. The question remains whether the nomination was made because of his credibility or as a favor that he might have made to the government.

This is not something new and this should not be incorporated into a political party, but there were many such incidents in the past under the government of Congress when Rangnath Mishra and M.C. Chagla did the same thing. That these mistakes were made in the past does not justify these appointments now.

There have been instances in the past where members of parliament go on to become judges.

Due to lockdown, the Supreme Court decided to hear only urgent cases. Amid this catastrophe, where tens of millions of migrant worker were stuck without jobs, money and resources at the place of their work, the government didn’t find the petition filed by Jagdeep Chokkar for the return of stranded workers to their homes urgent. On the other hand, the Supreme Court heard the petition filed by journalist Arnab Goswani, known to be close to the BJP government, for quashing of an FIR’s on the very next day. Is this the justice which the judiciary strives to deliver?

The report of the investigation of a sexual harassment complaint against the CJI was not even made public citing I<em>ndra Jaising Vs. Supreme Court</em>. The judgment was delivered by the Hon’ble bench on the basis of a report which was not shown to anyone. It is clear infringement, in my view, of the principle of natural justice that the report on which the allegations were denied was not even shown to the accused.

Internet services were curtailed in state of Jammu and Kashmir for nearly 6 months. The Supreme court procrastinated this matter of utmost importance. Around 12.5 million people were deprived of functional internet for nearly 6 months. They were totally cut-off from the rest of the world.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The Constitution of India provides justice for all. Members of the Judiciary are the administrators of justice. The judges strive to ensure free and impartial administration of justice in order to provide its citizens fairness in application of law. The duty of judges is considered to be very pious, therefore the constitution has provided for independence of judiciary so that they can remain impartial to serve the constitutional goals, act fairly, reasonably, free of any fear or favor. The problem starts when the other organs, i.e. the legislature and the executive start to interfere with them. The external interference not only erodes the piousness of the profession, but curtails individuals of their rights. In the recent past it has been seen that retired judges takes public office within a very short span of time after their retirement. Amazingly, it was found that they were involved in many decisions important to the government in their tenure and more surprisingly they ruled in favor of the government. These early-retirement appointments are a real issue to worry about. The decision of the court of hearing a useless political petition urgently and refusing to consider an urgent petition, involving real problems of needy people is not understandable.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“<em>It is the obligation of every person born in a safer room to open the door when someone in danger knocks.</em>”</blockquote>
In the wake of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, the Supreme Court of India passed an order to release all the detainees who have completed two years in detention centres in Assam upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of the that sum by Indian citizens. Originally, the apex court had <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/detenues-who-have-completed-more-than-three-years-in-assam-detention-centers-should-be-released-supreme-court-144987?infinitescroll=1">ruled</a> that only those detainees are to be released who have completed more than three years in detention centre upon execution of a that bond with two sureties of Rs. 1 lakh. The compassionate order of the Supreme Court has domestic as well as global ramifications. In this article, we will talk about the conditions of these detainees and the rights being violated, especially during the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19.

To understand the importance of the order, a little background of the situation is essential. Under the supervision of the Supreme Court, the state government of Assam <a href="https://assam.gov.in/en/main/NRC">undertook</a> a statewide exercise, known as "National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Asssam" to identify and deport illegal immigrants. On December 31, 2019, the final draft of the NRC was <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/assam-nrc-final-list-out-what-will-happen-to-the-19-lakh-excluded-people/story/376476.html">published</a> and out of 30.3 million people, more than 1.9 million people were excluded. The Union has the power to deport foreign nationals staying illegally in the country under <a href="http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1946-31.pdf">Section 3(2)(c)</a> of The Foreigners Act, 1946 and the state governments have also been entrusted with similar powers under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/373660/">Article 258(1)</a> of the Constitution. While the NRC itself has been seen as a procedural and administrative <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49520593">debacle</a>, the more pressing concern is the dismal and inhuman <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/the-truth-about-assam-s-detention-centres-1644836-2020-02-10">condition</a> of the detention centres in Assam.

According to the <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-1000-foreigners-lodged-in-6-detention-centres-in-assam-28-died-in-3-years-home-ministry/343142">data</a> provided by the Union Home Ministry, over 1000 people are lodged in 6 detention centres in Assam. While Assam is in its nebulous stage of COVID-19 transmission, with 34 positive <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/a-glimpse-inside-indias-covid-19-lockdown-in-assam/">case</a>s reported, there is a fear that if the situation escalates, the detainees crammed in the detention centres will suffer the worst, as they lack even basic hygiene and medical facilities. Recently, a <a href="https://amnesty.org.in/news-update/india-covid-19-government-must-act-as-lives-at-risk-in-overcrowded-detention-centres-in-assam/">report</a> by Amnesty International portrayed overcrowding of these detention centres where detainees are forced to survive without basic amenities of life. This is in violation of <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">Article 25</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, which promises a standard of living adequate for their health and well-being.

The state government’s apathy has led to deprivation of the <a href="https://www.lawctopus.com/academike/article-21-of-the-constitution-of-india-right-to-life-and-personal-liberty/">Fundamental Right</a> to Life and Personal Liberty of the detainees, as guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The denial of basic rights in the detention centre is <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/DetentionOrImprisonment.aspx">violative</a> of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, namely, Principle 1, 3, 4 and 6. Further, it is also in violation of <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">Article 7 and 9</a> of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 and Article 5 and 9 of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">UDHR</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/503489533b8.pdf">Guideline 6</a> of the UNHCR Detention Guidelines, 2012 provides that no illegal migrant shall be detained for an indefinite period of time, but the Foreigners Act, 1946 of India doesn’t specify any upper limit.

Against this backdrop, the order of the Supreme Court assumes significance and vindicates the Right to life, as guaranteed to both, citizens and non-citizens by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has interpreted ‘right to life’ in <em>Francis Coralie Mullin v. The Administrator, Union</em> to include within its ambit the right to live with human dignity and the right to all basic necessities of life. In the <em>State of Punjab v. M.S. Chawla</em>, the apex court ruled that ‘right to life’ includes within its boundaries the right to health and medical care. The order of the Court upholds the Human Rights of the detainees as enshrined under the UDHR and ICCPR, both of which have been ratified by the Union of India.

With the <a href="http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/214646.pdf">enactment</a> of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/nationwide-nrc-to-be-implemented-before-2024-lok-sabha-polls-amit-shah-11575290024624.html">promise</a> of the Home Minister to undertake a nationwide NRC, the equitable and compassionate stand of the Supreme Court is much welcomed, in the context of the rights available to illegal immigrants. In the disturbing times of this pandemic, the most <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelyncorley/2020/04/21/why-refugees-are-the-worlds-most-vulnerable-people-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/#95dbcd141128">vulnerable</a> people across the world are the stateless refugees, while there are serious concerns about their well-being. In such a scenario, the order of the Supreme Court, which in the garb of protecting national security, provides relief to immigrants, comes as a beacon of hope in the sea of human rights jurisprudence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The spread of COVID-19 infection cases has accelerated with fervid intensity over the past few weeks, with the tally of infections <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">reported</a> by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) at a whopping 4,254,302 cases (as of May 12, 2020).

India itself, battling with an infection rate doubling every <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/doubling-rate-of-covid-19-cases-at-10-2-days-recovery-rate-rises-to-23-3-govt-11588076165202.html">10.2 days</a>, is in for another two weeks’ partial lockdown starting from the 4th of May 2020. In such scenarios, one of the most essential services, classified by the World Health Organisation is waste collection and sanitation services.

It is a low income-generative sector largely comprising of low income, unprotected, informally employed workers, who in turn constitute one of the most vulnerable groups - economically, socially and politically in India during such pandemics.

Due to the mass spread of COVID-19, many workers in this sector are already on the verge of being deprived of their daily jobs, being ordered to stay in for their safety and the public’s, pushing them into significant <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/social-distancing-a-luxury-that-workers-on-rs-152-a-day-cant-afford/articleshow/74770167.cms?from=mdr">economic</a> risks. And those who in fact manage to retain their jobs, work in public spaces along with health workers and policemen, getting exposed to significant risks of infections. However, as the supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) are already <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52215071">dwindling</a> for health workers and policemen themselves, sanitation workers stand last in the priority line to be given protection (as their importance is often overlooked and overshadowed by the healthcare and police services), leaving them as the group of essential workers with the least access to health facilities, insurance and protective safety nets – social and otherwise.

<strong>Health and Economic Risks</strong>

<strong>Health Risks</strong>

Sanitation and waste disposal workers are one of the major forces that are preventing the spread of the infection through their work constantly cleaning and sanitizing. They are aggregating and disposing of tons of highly contagious marked/unmarked medical waste (like protective masks, gloves, tissues, tunics, gowns, caps, used syringes and IV bags) generated from isolation wards, hospitals, research facilities and homes where people have quarantined themselves along with segregating the contagious waste from general waste on a daily basis. However, the disconcerting truth is that while the privileged stay safe in their homes or protected under masks and gloves, these workers work often without adequate safety gear and equipment.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, acknowledging the paramount importance of cleaners and waste disposal workers in such health crisis, had released elaborate guidelines to require workers to strictly follow safe and disciplined handling practices for COVID-related waste to avoid any secondary transmissions.

However, the intended effects of such guidelines and rules seem nowhere near and can be confirmed to be lacking by reported cases of negligent disposal of contaminated material leading to harmful exposure of unprotected health workers. Infected face masks are being dumped in huge quantities in household garbage and being collected by unprotected rag pickers reportedly in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/coronavirus-no-system-in-place-for-disposal-of-used-face-masks-6327063/">Pune</a>. Individuals are drying thousands of washed masks in the open to resell them reportedly in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/city/mumbai/mumbai-man-arrested-for-dumping-used-face-masks-in-open-space/videoshow/74590346.cms">Thane</a>. Heaps of medical waste are reportedly <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kalindi-kunj-refugee-camp-medical-waste-coronavirus-hunger-6341211/">lying</a> in the open field in Delhi’s Sharan Vihar and Mumbai’s Bhiwandi area. And mounds of contaminated masks are reportedly lying around in the open near the <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/dumped-masks-at-delhis-vasant-kunj-to-maharashtras-bhiwandi-has-govt-worried/1804423">Rohingya</a> camps in Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. The reports keep coming in even as India’s COVID-19 infection graph continues to peak up.

While civic bodies in urban and rural areas across the country are working tirelessly to ensure hygiene in and around containment zones and hotspots, unprotected sanitation workers at the ground continue to take the brunt of the virus. Some frontline healthcare and sanitation workers are even being asked to take dosages of the anti-viral hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which has shown mixed results as a potential treatment of Covid-19, but certainly has harmful effects on the body like anorexia, diarrhoea, gastrointestinal intolerance and hampered cardiovascular activities, as <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/environment/covid-19-how-safe-are-antiviral-drugs-for-environment--70730">reported</a> by Down To Earth.

<strong>Economic Risks</strong>

Economically, the workers are expected to face the brunt of the pandemic the harshest in slowed economies. Many workers are not able to report to their duties and are even banned from some societies and houses, eliminating all sources of their daily wages, on which their survival rests. This disproportionately affects women workers (who form a major chunk (<a href="https://www.pria.org/knowledge_resource/1571820425_Lived_Realities_of_Women_Sanitation_Workers_in_India_20-10-19.pdf">over 50%</a>) of the workforce in India) who are now forced to stay at home without any regular inflow of wages, expected to take care of the family and even falling prey to domestic issues.

Moreover, the workers who are asked to report to their duties aren’t able to. Apart from concerns of personal safety, issues like negligibly operational public transport facilities, harassment by policemen over the absence of required curfew passes are causing them to avoid reaching their workplaces.

Some health workers and sanitation staff on duty have even been brutally attacked by the locals, leading to which the Union Cabinet of India had to pass an ordinance amending the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to make such an attack on health workers, a cognizable and non-bailable offence. However, the sanitation workers were again left out by the government from the protection of this law.

<strong>Probable Solution and Recommendations</strong>

Luckily, the conditions of waste pickers and the sanitation staff across other COVID-19 hot spots of the world is not as unpleasant as India’s. The tremendous threat to their health and economic conditions and its response by the government can be an important learning opportunity for the world.

A petition has already been brought in the Delhi High Court, seeking to have concerned authorities issue appropriate protective gear to the sanitation workers. While the Indian central government maintains that all guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the safety of sanitation workers are being followed, the matter is slated for further hearing in front of a division bench of Justices D.N. Patel and Justice C. Harishankar on the 8th of May.

However, without immediate policy interventions, it might be too late to control the situation. For this reason, we offer the following recommendations:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>All sanitization and waste workers should be equipped as a priority with at least basic personal protective equipment (like masks, gloves, sanitizers) to avoid secondary transmission of infection</strong>.
Further, point-of-care diagnostic tests services should also be provided. This protective gear can be acquired from governmental funds. For example, the state of <a href="https://www.prsindia.org/report-summaries/fourteenth-finance-commission-report">Maharashtra</a> permitted civic bodies to use the Fourteenth Finance Commission funds to purchase PPE for sanitation workers, and even allowed them to work in shifts. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, India has also permitted <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/covid-19-related-spends-to-be-treated-as-csr-activity-mca/article31143721.ece">CSR funds</a> to be utilized to make available preventive healthcare and sanitation to these workers. This protective gear could alternatively be purchased from local groups the way, the State of <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/shgs-race-against-time-to-stitch-masks/article31112170.ece">Telangana</a> roped in the help of self-help groups (SHGs) to produce masks for sanitation workers or foreign countries.Further, those workers, reporting to duty must be provided with the means to reach their workplace safely – through adequate and safe transportation facilities and permits to move during curfews in hot spot/containment areas.</li>
 	<li><strong><strong><strong>The pandemic has had a drastic effect over workforces and particularly the informal ones. Therefore, policy responses should majorly be aimed at increasing governmental spending.
</strong></strong></strong>Spending should specifically be increased to provide two fundamental needs. First, spending should be used to provide i<span>mmediate relief to workers to help secure their existing livelihoods or engage them in alternative safe livelihood opportunities. Second, spending should be used to provide e</span><span><span>xtended support through social welfare nets in the recovery periods when the economy slumps.</span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>The systems of waste collection, segregation and disposal are currently under-equipped to deal with such unprecedented amounts of biomedical waste and as such they must be scaled up appropriately.</strong><span><span><span>
To alleviate their burden, it is required that the government upscale infected waste containment facilities to accept and treat the additional inflow of biomedical waste. The government must also incorporate preventive measures in the waste material chain itself like segregation at source, sanitization etc.</span></span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>The guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for the handling of biowaste should be enforced right from the ground without fail along with systems of regular monitoring. They should also be incorporated within the frameworks of urban civic bodies.</strong></li>
</ol>
The workers are already fighting a battle with the virus so that the communities and society do not have to. These poor people, already on the verge of losing their livelihood should not be left on their own to fight for their safety and health while they perform such an essential public function for the country to help curb the spreading of the pandemic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Coronavirus is causing major economic upheavals and thousands of deaths and hospitalizations throughout the US. Unfortunately, immigrants, people of color, and marginalized groups are being hit equally hard by the disease. To make matters even worse, refugee admissions are suspended, all in-person naturalization services have stopped, and the status of all immigration into the United States is up in the air. Through all of this, those forced to live in immigrant detention facilities are particularly vulnerable.

<strong>“Sitting Ducks” in ICE Detention Facilities </strong>

As of April 19, 2020 there were at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/deportations-coronavirus-guatemala.html">124 confirmed</a> cases of COVID-19 among immigrant detainees held by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (<a href="https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus#wcm-survey-target-id">ICE</a>). Advocates for immigrants have been filing lawsuits to have detainees released due to the close quarters they are living in. Most detainees are adults, but the population includes many elderly people and children.

In March 2020 ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) convened a working group of medical professionals, disease control specialists, detention experts, and field operators to identify additional steps to minimize the spread of the virus. According to the <a href="https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus#wcm-survey-target-id">ERO</a>:
<blockquote>“ICE has since evaluated its detained population based upon the CDC’s guidance for people who might be at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19... Of this population, ICE has released nearly 700 individuals after evaluating their immigration history, criminal record, potential threat to public safety, flight risk, and national security concerns... Additionally, ERO has limited the intake of new detainees being introduced into ICE detention system.”</blockquote>
With a current detainee population of 33,000, a lack of necessary space to practice social distancing guidelines presents inherent problems within the detention facilities. ICE claims that detainees who meet Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for risk of exposure to COVID-19 are housed separately from the general population.

They place detainees with fever and/or respiratory symptoms in a single medical housing room, or in a medical airborne infection isolation room specifically designed to contain biological agents, such as COVID-19. ICE transports individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, or those who require higher levels of care or monitoring, to appropriate hospitals with expertise in high-risk care.

However, concern remains high for those who are detained and have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or asthma. At the Otay Mesa facility near San Diego, advocates say there have been hunger strikes since April 3 with a fluctuating number of participants.

"They're really scared. They just feel like they're sitting ducks. They just think, 'When is this going to hit?'" immigration attorney <a href="https://profiles.superlawyers.com/washington/seattle/lawyer/michele-carney/1cbb4266-c31b-4d0d-b02c-0a9974127d05.html">Michele Carney</a> tells NBC news. She has been fighting to get several clients released from the Tacoma, Washington Northwest Detention Center.

<strong>Coronavirus Brings a Decrease in Deportations </strong>

For some undocumented immigrants, this pandemic has given them some breathing room. With orders from state governments directing everyone to stay home and conduct essential business only, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has shifted their focus to only pursuing foreign nationals who have committed a crime.

During the last fiscal year running from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019, ICE deported more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/ice-deported-thousands-of-family-members-minors-as-overall-arrests-dropped/2019/12/11/7d29dada-1b8d-11ea-87f7-f2e91143c60d_story.html">267,000</a> people, or 22,250 per month, a 4 percent increase from the year before. However, during March 2020, ICE completed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/deportations-coronavirus-guatemala.html">17,965</a> removals, according to agency records. Total deportations have declined so far in April with 2,985 deportations.

Hoping to help limit the spread of the virus and encourage immigrants to seek medical help if necessary, ICE sent a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/18/818095140/ice-halts-most-arrests-amid-coronavirus-crisis">notification</a> to Congress on March 18 regarding a change in their enforcement actions. ICE stated their Enforcement and Removal Operations division will “delay enforcement actions” and use “alternatives to detention” amid the outbreak. The notification further said:
<blockquote>“During the COVID-19 crisis, ICE will not carry out enforcement operations at or near health care facilities, such as hospitals, doctors’ offices, accredited health clinics, and emergent or urgent care facilities, except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Individuals should not avoid seeking medical care because they fear civil immigration enforcement.”</blockquote>
However ICE will continue to investigate criminal activity including drug and gang related crimes and child exploitation. Their main focus will be on people who have already been convicted of a crime for mandatory detention and deportation. On March 18, ICE reported that removal flights to Italy, China and South Korea have been suspended, although ICE is <a href="https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus">continuing</a> to deport immigrants from other countries. Prior to boarding, however, immigrants must undergo a temperature screening and anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher is referred to a medical provider.

However, authorities in Guatemala are claiming that between 30 and 40 Guatemalans flown home by ICE since late March tested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/us/deportations-coronavirus-guatemala.html">positive</a> for the Coronavirus after returning.

All immigration courts have been temporarily <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/eoir-operational-status-during-coronavirus-pandemic">closed</a> by the Justice Department to avoid spreading the Coronavirus, and all hearings have been cancelled except for those already detained.

<strong>Refugee Admissions on Pause</strong>

While it is good news to some that ICE will cut back on their enforcement efforts, there are many other negative aspects to the situation for those hoping to claim refugee status and obtain a green card. The United States <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/us-refugee-admissions-coronavirus/index.html">paused</a> refugee admissions as of March 19, 2020. Fearing that international travel "could increase the exposure of refugees to the virus,” the International Organization for Migration, which is in charge of booking refugees' travel, and the UN refugee agency announced a suspension of resettlement travel.

The United States had planned to admit a maximum of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/10/07/key-facts-about-refugees-to-the-u-s/">18,000</a> refugees in fiscal year 2020 under a new refugee admissions ceiling set by the Trump administration, down from a cap of 30,000 in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2019. This would be the lowest number of refugees resettled by the U.S. in a single year since 1980, when Congress created the nation’s refugee resettlement program.

<strong>All In-Person Services Suspended</strong>

To the dismay of those waiting to obtain a green card, be officially naturalized, or apply for asylum or refugee status, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/uscis-response-covid-19">USCIS</a>) announced on March 17 it is suspending its in-person services including all interviews and naturalization ceremonies, to help mitigate the spread of Coronavirus.

ICE also announced it will temporarily reschedule in-person appointments of immigrants who are not in detention to "minimize the impact" of Coronavirus. The agency will also allow those recently released from the southern border to check in at 60 days, instead of 30 days.

<strong>California Takes Care of Their Immigrants</strong>

As millions of Americans begin to receive their $1,200 check from the federal government and an extra $600 per week for the unemployed, undocumented immigrants have been left out in the cold. Many have lost their jobs due to business closures, and farmers have had to destroy many of their crops because there is no market for them. Undocumented immigrants are not allowed to receive any federal funds under the CARES Act nor unemployment benefits, forcing them to rely on food banks and other charities.

But realizing that the 2.2 million immigrants who live in California play a large role in the state’s economy and pay $2.5 billion in taxes every year, Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would spend $75 million to create a Disaster Relief <a href="https://apnews.com/679ae0f08b2f67df454e22e9e62e1bad">Fund</a> for those living there illegally.

One hundred fifty thousand adults who were left out of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress will receive $500 each. The state will give the money to a network of regional nonprofits to find and vet potential recipients. Advocates say that's key to making the plan work because immigrants are unlikely to contact the government for fear of deportation.

<strong>A Temporary End to Immigration</strong>

On April 20, President Trump tweeted that he intends to sign an executive order to temporarily suspend all immigration into the United States. This will be challenged in court, but that will take time. Many view all the new regulations as an attempt by the Trump administration to implement their original <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/politics/immigration-restrictions-coronavirus/index.html">restrictionist policies</a>, such as blocking entry to asylum seekers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Under <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj_kKLv55LpAhXm63MBHWXRDsIQFjAKegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fprofessionalinterest%2Fpages%2Fcrc.aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw06IzabSOudAFhz0Cjv14Ai">Article 1</a> of the Convention on the Rights of Child, a “child” is defined as a human being below the age of 18 years old and, in legal parlance, a child is referred to as a minor. A <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjOwYye5ZLpAhVD63MBHQwYBeUQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unicef.org%2Fpublications%2Ffiles%2FA_Statistical_Snapshot_of_Violence_Against_Adolescent_Girls.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HfAmUz0Hpyi0NpeIki3_k">study</a> by UNICEF found that 1 out of 3 girls and 1 out of 5 boys were likely to be sexually assaulted before they reach the age of 18, and in a startling revelation, also found that 90% of these children know their offenders.

Child pornography refers to the portrayal of a minor or a person who appears to be minor in a sexually explicit act by way of videos, photographs or other computer-generated content. Even the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/child-pornography">modification</a> of an image or video in such way that it appears to be a minor engaged in a sexually explicit act is considered child pornography. Child pornography is one of the most heinous crimes in existence because it encourages sexual abuse of children, sex tourism, human trafficking etc.

Over the years, the sharing of child porn over the internet has increased manifold. In 1998, over <a href="https://enough.org/stats_exploitation">3,000 cases</a> were registered against websites containing child pornography. The number of cases increased to <a href="https://enough.org/stats_exploitation">over 100,000</a> just a decade later, and in the year 2014, the number exceeded <a href="https://enough.org/stats_exploitation">1 million</a> for the first time. Last year, there were <a href="https://enough.org/stats_exploitation">18.4 million</a> reported cases of child pornography across the world.

The porn industry has been highly lucrative these days and is spreading across the globe in an exceedingly coordinated manner. It is a multi-million-dollar industry that has made young children its most vulnerable victims. According to market figures from the <a href="https://endsexualexploitation.org/statistics/">National Center for Sexual Abuse</a>, child pornography is one of the fastest growing online businesses and India is among its biggest consumers and contributors. In India, a pornographic video is captured every <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTif7asZXpAhWbYisKHXTNCfIQFjAAegQIBhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Findiahome%2Findianews%2Farticle-4855694%2FIndia-world-s-worse-rates-online-child-pornography.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vhaOMKNXDOhIFbeCEt57n">40 seconds</a>, about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTif7asZXpAhWbYisKHXTNCfIQFjAAegQIBhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Findiahome%2Findianews%2Farticle-4855694%2FIndia-world-s-worse-rates-online-child-pornography.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vhaOMKNXDOhIFbeCEt57n">38 percent</a> of which are linked to child sexual abuse. The director of the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4855694/India-world-s-worse-rates-online-child-pornography.html">Indian Cyber Army</a> stated that, around 25% of all the search engine queries in India are related to child pornography. A recent study by the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) found that more than <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiIv_H4sZXpAhVPU30KHVSMDWcQFjADegQIBBAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Findia%2Fwhy-india-lags-in-tackling-online-child-sex-abuse%2Farticleshow%2F74008263.cms&amp;usg=AOvVaw0A4e4j5VUZT3WKsqPbROT-">25,000 pieces</a> of alleged child sexual abuse content have been uploaded to social media platforms in India over the last 5 months (as on 2nd May 2020).

This article analyzes the issue of child pornography and the international frameworks that are present to deal with this menace. A special emphasis is laid on the Indian laws that are meant to tackle child pornography.

<strong>The Role of International Law in Combating Child Pornography</strong>

The United Nations <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJrqqxspXpAhWWbisKHYFnDbwQFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ohchr.org%2Fen%2Fprofessionalinterest%2Fpages%2Fcrc.aspx&amp;usg=AOvVaw06IzabSOudAFhz0Cjv14Ai">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>, 1989, the first legally binding treaty on the rights of children, provides for the protection of children from sexual abuse. Article 34 of the Convention puts obligations on the states to undertake all appropriate national, bilateral and multinational measures for the protection of children from all forms of sexual exploitation or abuse.

In 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPSCCRC.aspx">Optional Protocol</a> on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (hereinafter “the optional protocol”). It is the leading universal treaty that deals specifically with the issue of sexual abuse of children. It recognized the rights of victims of these crimes and laid down standards for the protection of victims in the criminal justice process. The Optional Protocol provided not only for the strengthening of international cooperation and the adoption of extra-territorial laws, but also for the non-recognition of the concept of dual criminality. Article 3 of the Optional Protocol mandates the States to criminalize the production, distribution, importation, exportation, dissemination, offer or sale of child pornography and Article 3(1)(c) obliges the States to punish the possession of child porn if it is for any of the purposes previously mentioned.

The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (2001), aka, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3teS9s5XpAhVTyDgGHTzkDzgQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.europarl.europa.eu%2Fmeetdocs%2F2014_2019%2Fdocuments%2Flibe%2Fdv%2F7_conv_budapest_%2F7_conv_budapest_en.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw01h6a5GIcg_j0I61OaR6vw">Budapest Convention</a>, is among the foremost conventions that deal with child abuse as it has a more pragmatic approach with a universal application to both the judicial officers and the law enforcement agencies at the same time. Article 9 of the Budapest Convention defines child pornography as, “a material that visually depicts a minor or a person appearing to be minor to be engaged in a sexually explicit act." The Budapest Convention is also notable for its use of unambiguous terms and its detailed categorization of child pornography on the internet. It also provides for the criminalization of child pornography.

The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6zMCCl5PpAhVKwjgGHagTA_YQFjAGegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frm.coe.int%2F1680084822&amp;usg=AOvVaw0wCBuUA1MGgoL1kTb6WxCO">Convention on the Protection of Children</a> against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (2007) categorizes child pornography within child abuse. It is wider in its ambit as it also covers sexual tourism within child abuse. The drawback of this convention is its lack of global adoption as it has only been adopted by the European nations so far.

<strong>India's Response to Combating Child Pornography</strong>

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/601866/">Section 293</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 specifically criminalizes the sale, distribution, exhibition, circulation, etc. of any obscene material to any person below the age of twenty years. It considers such acts to be cognizable offences.

The Information and Technology Act, 2000 (hereinafter “IT Act”) is the bedrock of cyber laws in India. While it was being amended in 2008 to expand its ambit, both the Standing Committee and the Expert Committee to the Information and Technology (Amendment) Bill recommended for the incorporation of a specific provision dealing with the criminalization of child pornography. The recommendation manifested in the form of insertion of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/176300164/">Section 67B</a> to IT Act, which criminalized child pornography. For “first time offenders”, it provides imprisonment for a term of five years and a fine of ten lakh rupees and for “subsequent offenders”, the term of imprisonment is seven years along with a fine of ten lakh rupees. Also, under the IT Act, the storage and consumption of adult porn is <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15057582/">not criminalized</a> but the storage and consumption of child porn is criminalized.

The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR4ODgzpTpAhU7zDgGHVAoA64QFjABegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwcd.nic.in%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FProtection%2520of%2520Children%2520From%2520Sexual%2520Offences%2520%2528Amendment%2529%2520Act%252C%25202019.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1n-aJb-BrNb88MH9_KCTfn">Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act</a>, 2012 (hereinafter “POCSO Act”) also provides for punishment regarding child pornography. Section 14 of the POCSO Act criminalizes the use of children for pornographic purposes in any form of media, including the portrayal of child’s sexual organs, the participation of a child in real or simulated sexual activities and the indecent or inappropriate portrayal of a child. Under the POCSO Act, the storage of child pornographic material for commercial purposes is criminalized but storage for non-commercial purposes is not.

While Section 67B of the IT Act targets the object of child pornography by criminalizing the pornographic depiction of a child, Section 14 of the POCSO Act targets the subject of child pornography by criminalizing the use of a child for the purpose of pornography. The consent of a child is irrelevant under both the laws as a child is deemed unable to give consent.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Child pornography is not only a legal issue, but also a moral issue as it has the propensity to adversely alter a child’s perception of humanity. The repeated circulation of pornographic content over the internet worsens the trauma of child victims by keeping the wounds fresh.

The International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC) analyzed child pornography laws in <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/study-child-porn-isnt-illegal-in-most-countries/d/d-id/1042033">184 Interpol-member countries</a> and found that more than half of them had no legislation directly addressing the problem of child pornography, and those countries where laws were in place were unsuccessful in dealing with it efficiently. As of now, only <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiAiOWQpZXpAhVhmeYKHWlDCM8QFjACegQIAhAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolis.osce.org%2Ffile%2F6241%2Fdownload%3Ftoken%3DCQEacFFi&amp;usg=AOvVaw05RITxrwHqhhOT-1SA9UNJ">45 countries</a> in the world have comprehensive laws to combat child pornography.

Despite having some international conventions in place, we, as a global community, have had setbacks in chalking out conclusive guidelines for their implementation. A universal global framework for the detection, assessment, and prosecution of online child pornography is the need of the hour, and it must be implemented as a principle of international law. The framework should be more inclusive and less dogmatic in its approach, and it should be one that reinforces redressal mechanisms through global cooperation and participation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

COVID-19, which has brought human life to a standstill across the globe, is not a climate-change pandemic. The worldwide increase of infectious disease is the result of a changed human lifestyle that has consequently altered the biological ecosystem. The spread of infectious agents because of climate conditions was <a href="https://www.who.int/globalchange/summary/en/index5.html">discovered</a> in the later part of the nineteenth century. Extreme changes in climatic conditions pose a threat to human health because they affect the determinants of human health which include air quality, supply of safe drinking water, nutrition level in food, secure shelter, etc. The World Health Organization (WHO) back in 2018 said that climate change will cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat exhaustion. However, COVID-19 has now been the reason for <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">297,220 deaths</a> in less than six months around the globe.

In addition to demonstrating our failure to combat the pandemic, the current outbreak is also a harbinger for a deadly future where many such diseases may be unshackled due to a rampant rise in Earth’s temperature every year. Climate change from pollution and other human activities is a significant cause for worry. It not only has lead to ozone depletion thereby making the population susceptible to harmful solar rays, but also has loomed over the planet as an impending threat in the form of other disastrous changes. The coronavirus pandemic is a frightening prelude for potential pandemics triggered by the ongoing deep destabilization of the natural environment through climate change.

<strong>Climate Change Amid COVID-19</strong>

With reduced human activities all around the world, there have been certain positive changes in climatic conditions. This is due to the worldwide lockdown <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-set-to-cause-largest-ever-annual-fall-in-co2-emissions">restricting</a> human movement and decreasing transportation, electricity demands and industrial activity. Thus, it has provided us with an opportunity to combat climate change. Addressing climate change is vital to reduce evolving health risks. It has been reported that children and elderly people are more vulnerable to the health challenges posed by climate change. Climate change affects human health in two primary ways: firstly, by altering the gravity of health problems through changed climatic conditions, and secondly, the discovery of new unforeseen <a href="https://health2016.globalchange.gov/">health problems</a>. The following are some examples of positive climate change caused by COVID-19.

<strong>Control of the Emission of Greenhouse Gases</strong>

Because of the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on transportation and business, air pollution has fallen in several areas. As per the reports of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, methods such as quarantines and travel bans which were enforced by governments across the globe have resulted in a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/04/811019032/why-chinas-air-has-been-cleaner-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak">25 percent reduction</a> of carbon emissions in China. In fact, a study in the USA indicates that carbon monoxide levels have dropped by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51944780">50 percent</a> since 2019. This subsequent carbon emission mitigation is a boon that is expected to save a total of 77,000 lives. However, there is also another prevalent viewpoint that this reduction in emissions will be short-lived. Many people expect that countries will easily counteract this reduction through their temptation to rehabilitate their economies after the deprivations induced by COVID-19. The costs of crude oil have fallen by almost two-thirds from last year because of limited traffic on roads amidst this lockdown. This may trigger a shift toward cleaner fuels and lead to the beginning of a sustained downward trend in the usage of crude oil.

<strong>Reduction in Air Pollution</strong>

There was also a decline in the emissions of nitrous oxide from vehicles and power plants in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-pollution/air-pollution-clears-in-northern-italy-after-coronavirus-lockdown-satellite-shows-idUSKBN2102X4">Italy</a> between the months of January-March, 2020. People staying at home resulted in a reduction in motor vehicle traffic, which ultimately led to a drop in air pollution levels. As per NASA, the decline in nitrogen dioxide emissions in Wuhan has spread gradually to the rest of the country. However, this drop was not a result of the health standards as other pollutants still remained in the air. In Venice, there was an improved abundance of fish and water traffic in the canals. The Mayor of Venice explained that the <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/488286-italys-coronavirus-lockdown-shows-what-nature">improved visibility</a> in the water was attributed to the deposition of sediments. The nationwide lockdown in India resulted in chaos and misery among the migrant and daily wage workers. Nonetheless, it also resulted in cleaner air than Delhi had seen in decades. Despite the vulnerable state of human civilization with 297,220 deaths and 4,347,921 people infected with the disease, the environment has recovered and nature is able to breathe more easily. With very limited transportation and the closure of factories, the world has witnessed improved air quality. It also has resulted in a declining risk of air-pollution borne disease like asthma and other lung infections.

<strong>The Opportunity to Meet Goals to Combat Climate Change</strong>

According to some analysts, this pandemic is providing certain countries with an opportunity to meet the objectives enshrined under the Paris Climate Agreement. Emissions have fallen due to the halt in industries and transportation. This change can be helpful to certain countries in achieving their Paris Agreement goals. Coronavirus is contributing to decreasing pollution mandated by international climate accords. It has indirectly caused nations to cut emissions that they could not have usually achieved. However, the desire to recover from the tangle of coronavirus and develop into a safer, better planet would rely not on the short-term effects to tackle the pandemic, but on policy decisions that will occur over the long run. Economic recession, declines in energy consumption and demographic changes may lead to drastic environmental effects. The strain on the Earth has abruptly lightened after decades of increasingly rising. Megacities such as Bangkok, Beijing, New Delhi and New York have registered an extraordinary decrease in pollution because of coronavirus restrictions. Delhi had previously often had an air quality index of 200 a day (far exceeding the limit of 25 recognized by the World Health Organization). However, with this nation-wide lockdown, Delhi's 11 million automobiles have been withdrawn from the roads while factories and development have come to standstill. Thus, AQI rates have dropped gradually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/11/positively-alpine-disbelief-air-pollution-falls-lockdown-coronavirus">below 20</a>. The task for India in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis is to prioritize its health and economic sectors. The current need is to support <a href="https://www.iisd.org/library/india-energy-transition-2020">renewable energy</a>.

<strong>Community Lesson</strong>

Many people have taken social initiatives and measures to defend themselves and others from this pandemic. The fast and broad response that the world witnessed has raised a hope that quick steps on climate change might also be taken similar to this pandemic. Nobody could have anticipated the pandemic resulting in lowering of the pollution. By the reaction of people across the globe, we are witnessing a humanitarian character that shows people do care for one another. It will be an important lesson as mass cooperation would be required to deal with climate change.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Changes in infectious disease transmission patterns are likely a major consequence of climate change. Coronavirus is a global health catastrophe whose far-reaching implications are yet to be uncovered. The priority of the nations is to contain the virus and stop its spread. The current crisis requires harmonious construction between special measures and essential safeguards. The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and climate change are intimately linked. Though emissions have fallen, we must monitor the impact of the pandemic on the atmosphere and the unexpected patterns that are evolving. When we eventually overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, financial and social packages for the maintenance and ultimate resurgence of the post-pandemic global economy should promote health, fairness and protection of the environment. At present, the world is witnessing unprecedented rates of injustice, environmental destruction, destabilization of the climate, economic instability and increased risks to public safety. These critical conditions make us ponder the need to reconsider our potential measures for the future. Nations should invest in upgrading their health sector and promoting Universal Health Coverage (UHC). These measures can prove helpful in the long run to minimize the threats that will exist from the future occurrence of pandemics and climate change. We must increase our flexibility and capacity to deal with such a crisis.

COVID-19 has made us adjust our actions significantly to defend ourselves and everyone around us. It has led to increasing civil response and successful risk control through concerted action. While climate change casts longer-term health issues, it would require certain actions, which need to be taken at present to tackle future emergencies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe Biden doesn’t deserve due process and the presumption of innocence with respect to Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegation. Brett Kavanaugh didn’t deserve them with respect to Christine Blasey Ford either.

Why?

Neither is facing a criminal prosecution — no one has threatened to take their liberty away.

The #MeToo movement has inspired people across the world to speak out against sexual predators and put some, like Harvey Weinstein, in prison. But when the allegations don’t support a criminal prosecution (either because the evidence is too weak or the statute of limitations has expired), public figures continue to invoke criminal-law protections in the realm of the court of public opinion. For example, just two weeks ago, House Speaker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/biden-me-too.html">Nancy Pelosi</a> claimed that Biden is entitled to “due process.” The arbitrary use of this constitutional right, along with “beyond a reasonable doubt” and the “presumption of innocence,” dilutes these fundamental criminal-law protections, while abdicating Americans’ duty to properly vet our leaders.

We live in an America that incarcerates over a million people of color, who are <a href="https://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/">five times more likely</a> to be incarcerated than white Americans. As a criminal defense attorney, I’ve seen how this system operates. All too often, defendants who have been arrested, especially people of color and the poor, are treated as if they’ve already been found guilty. The presumption of innocence applies only in theory. Policies like the cash bail system, which force people who can’t afford bail to sit in jail indefinitely unless they agree to a plea deal, only exacerbate this injustice.

Thus, when white public figures invoke criminal-law constitutional protections for their own benefit, there’s a tone-deaf quality that completely ignores the staggeringly antagonistic and racist attitude towards these rights in our criminal-justice system. Unlike so many, Joe Biden’s freedom is not on the line.

Criminal law standards are not privileges that public figures should arbitrarily call upon to shield themselves from accountability. Rather, they’re constitutional pillars that only hold water when the government is attempting to take away the most sacred of American values: liberty.

That said, the criminal justice system is not the only place where we reckon with the consequences of allegedly wrongful behavior. Does an employer have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that their employee stole from the business before firing that employee? Is a university professor entitled to the presumption of innocence when students claim that the professor acted sexually inappropriately with them at office hours?

The answer is “no.” As a country, we’ve never set the bar so high to prove malfeasance in relation to employment. And, at the heart of it, isn’t a presidential election ultimately an employment issue? The same goes for the Supreme Court confirmation process.

What standard, then, should we hold public figures to when there’s a decades-old allegation of sexual assault that can’t be prosecuted criminally? Far too often, those in power sweep inconvenient allegations under the proverbial rug. This certainly isn’t the answer. Since the “jurors” in a court of public opinion are the American people, a starting point would be to provide these jurors with access to the results of an independent, objective investigation. Such a non-partisan investigation team should be formed when allegations are lodged against someone seeking an important public office, such as President of the United States or Supreme Court Justice. This investigative committee should not draw conclusions. Instead, it should present the facts that it discovered from its independent investigation.

In the case of Joe Biden, American voters can then decide whether they believe Tara Reade’s allegations, and, if they believe them, whether Biden is still preferable to another man (Donald Trump) who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, including rape.

What standard should people apply to the question of whether the allegations are true? Certainly, "beyond a reasonable doubt" is too high of a standard, resulting in a substantial likelihood that a culprit will be excused for their past wrongdoing. Since no one’s liberty is at stake, I propose that we use the civil law standard of “preponderance of the evidence.” This means that you treat the person as if they committed the alleged conduct if you believe that it’s more likely than not that the wrongful behavior occurred. That’s enough certainty to take money away from someone in civil court, and it’s enough certainty when choosing who to vote for at the ballot box.

As I said before, Joe Biden isn’t entitled to the same due process, presumption of innocence, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt that my clients are when facing criminal charges. But the voters are entitled to the facts, and the court of public opinion needs unbiased information so that we can make knowledgeable decisions about the future of America. This is the only way to ensure everyone’s voice is heard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

The Indian Judicial system, as we know today incorporates the Supreme Court, high courts, and various other subordinate judiciaries. It began functioning on January 28, 1950. Since then, our judicial system has been able to prove itself as the nation’s moral conscience, upholding the rights of all citizens irrespective of their class, gender, status, religion, and on several occasions, it has also saved the democratically established government itself. Even though our nation’s judiciary has achieved remarkable feats in a span of just 70 years, a gap between ideal and reality is becoming wider and clearer over the years. Slow delivery of justice, the appointment of judges enmeshed in controversies, ineffective disciplinary mechanisms are some of the major problems our justice system is facing. The question of delay in the administration of justice has been addressed in the past, but even now there has been no considerable change. And the ironic thing is that today in all the other avenues of this modern civilization, speed and efficiency are of great significance. “Delayed Justice, if Justice at all” has become the <a href="http://www.delhihighcourt.nic.in/library/articles/mid day meal/Delays, costs and glorious uncertainity - how judicial procedure hurts the poor.pdf">basic premise</a> of the Indian Judicial system. There are almost 25 million pending cases all over the country and according to experts these numbers are likely to grow with the growing population unless and until something is done to tackle this. The objective of this article is to identify and study the gridlocks leading to such delay and inefficiency and to suggest effective measures to correct them.

The ineffectiveness of the Indian justice system has been in existence since the beginning of the 20th century, and many committees have been constituted to correct it. In 1924, a committee was constituted under Justice Rankin of the Calcutta High Court to cautiously look over the delay in the disposal of civil appeals and cases. Another committee under the chairmanship of S.R. Das was constituted in 1929, which suggested measures to reduce the arrears in the various courts of the country. But the result of all these committees had proved to be futile as the measures suggested by them were neither discussed nor implemented in the system. A report submitted by the High Court Arrears Committee, 1972 under the chairmanship of J.C. Shah identified the major cause of the delay in judicial administration as the lower number of judges in the High Courts as well as inordinate delay in vacancy appointments. Even various law commission reports such as the 14th, 27th, 41st, 54th, 58th, 71st, 74th, 79th, and 144th reports have several times posed the question of delay in the Indian Judicial System. Justice P.N. Bhagwati, in his Law Day speech in 1985 addressed the concerns about the judicial system and said that it is presently suffering from an ailment and is on the verge of collapse. So, not only the present generation, but also the past several generations have been suffering from the pace and inefficiencies of the adjudicating authority.

<strong>The Blind Spot: Criminal Justice</strong>

The criminal justice system has been revamped by hundreds of thousands of pending cases and is also skewed against the poor or unprivileged section of the society. Even though justice is served it still takes several years which highlights the deficiencies of the adjudicating authority. The Constitution of India grants every citizen certain fundamental rights, the breach of which may lead to legal consequences, but still, there are thousands of rape cases are never investigated, because of the belief that court may take 8-10 years to decide the matter. This is the ongoing condition of the Indian Judiciary. For example in the Nirbhaya Rape Case, even after the whole nation knew that those six people were guilty of rape and needed to be punished it still took the court 8 precious years of the victim's mother's life to decide whether they are guilty or not. The Mohammad Harris Nalapad Case in Bengaluru took into consideration the fact that charge sheets are never filed within the stipulated 60-day period. Evidence has also been tampered with in several cases due to political pressure or sometimes due to callousness.

<strong>Major Obstacles and Deadlocks</strong>

It is unfortunate that despite the Indian judiciary’s many successes, it is suffering from several structural problems, that hamper its effective and efficient administration of justice. Unlike in the past, this structural mess can be understood and analysed in a better way in present times, due to better availability of data. There are numerous causes behind the law’s delay and ineffectiveness. The inadequate number of judges as well as courts in the country is one of the primary causes of delayed disposal of cases. In the year 2000, unlike 107 judges to every million in the US, 75 in Canada, India only had 10.5 per million people. Incompetent and inefficient judges is another such reason. In Indian courts, it can be easily seen that there is a habit of taking adjournments by the majority of the lawyers for their own benefit. This is one of the big reasons for such a huge number of pending cases in India. The legal costs and all the expenses that a person has to incur to commence a legal action, even for a small claim, is so heavy that it becomes worthwhile to claim any legal action possible. The procedure and formalities are so complex and full of technicalities that it hinders the litigants at every stage. A lot of time is wasted on jurisdictional arguments, sufficiency of notices, causes of action, and other procedural issues. And even after the court of law has given the initial judgments, the number of counter appeals in higher courts is also one of the reasons for delay in imparting justice.

There are other reasons for the ineffectiveness in the working of our judiciary like many supreme court and high court judges being made to study various commission reports and recommendations which in turn hamper the working of our courts. Political affiliations and sluggish tactics committed by judges also defeat the true essence of the justice system. One of the biggest reasons for the delay in our courts is our country’s diverse culture, language, religious sentiments, customs and practices which pose an unsettling issue in front of our courts i.e. whenever a matter is addressed before a court of law, the rule to be applied is capable of hundreds and thousands of interpretations which prevents the judge making a straightforward and quick decision in not so complicated matters.

<strong>Suggestive Measures for the Way Ahead </strong>

The necessary changes cannot be brought in one day, but surely they will come if we strive for them. Despite many loopholes and deadlocks, a change needs to take place to reform the justice system in India. There can be various measures to affect this change.

The number of judges should be increased in the High Court as well as the Supreme court. Although we have highly qualified judges, their strength has failed to administer justice. As discussed earlier, we are far behind in the appointment of judges as compared to other developed nations, which is the main reason for inefficiency and ineffectiveness.

A Fast Track Court should be set up and also there is an urgent need to increase in the number of tribunals, judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. Each tribunal must be categorized according to the specialization of its judges which reduces the burden of the courts.

Red tape or the inordinate delay due to paperwork creates a gap between the sections of the society. This must be replaced by the technological infrastructure e.g. e-filing of cases, e- returns, and the files pertinent to the case must be stored online, which will lead to a speedy disposal of cases.

A major shift needs to made from adjourning authority to adjudicating authority and advocates who seek delay excessively must be condemned severely.

People should be made aware of the Alternative Dispute Resolution systems like mediation, arbitration, conciliation, etc. which ensure speedy justice to trivial cases and screening of matters that require court assistance.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Justice is a foundational goal of any civilization. Thus, it is imperative for the judicial system to perform its duty with due diligence so that society can strive for peace, harmony and progress. Article 39A of the Indian constitution shines a light upon the concept of free legal aid to poor and weaker sections of society, but keeping the present state in mind, it has failed to achieve significance. The judges are considered equivalent to god, hence it their duty to ensure that no guilty person escapes unpunished. Since our independence, we have suffered a lot due to the excruciating slow pace, but now is the time when reformations must be done in the Indian Justice System. “Justice delayed is justice denied” should be a major aim of every adjudicating authority. If this is not so, then how much we develop economically or technologically doesn’t matter because we will never be a developed nation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

As the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its domino effect on the economy intensifies, contractual parties have started to consider the need to modify or terminate their existing contracts. Not to mention, parties have progressively invoked force majeure provisions due to non-performance. The doctrine of supervening impossibility/frustration is cherished in the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/171398/">Indian Contract Act</a>. As per <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/648614/">Section 56</a>, an agreement to do an impossible act is itself void. Further, on account of such impossibility, the whole contract becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.

The Bombay High Court, in fact, viewed this situation differently when it dismissed reliance on Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

The recent order passed by the Bombay High Court on 8 April 2020 (<a href="https://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/generatenewauth.php?bhcpar=cGF0aD0uL3dyaXRlcmVhZGRhdGEvZGF0YS9vcmlnaW5hbC8yMDIwLyZmbmFtZT1DQVJCUDQwNDIwMDgwNDIwLnBkZiZzbWZsYWc9TiZyanVkZGF0ZT0mdXBsb2FkZHQ9MDkvMDQvMjAyMCZzcGFzc3BocmFzZT0xMjA0MjAxNTMyNTc=">No 404 of 2020</a>) in <em>Standard Retail Pvt. Ltd. v. M/s. G. S. Global Corp &amp; Ors</em> is, remarkably, the first case where an Indian Court while dismissing a Commercial Arbitration petition, has held that the "lockdown cannot come to the rescue of the Petitioners so as to resile from their contractual obligations." In other words, a lockdown in these unprecedented times, is not a legal basis for termination or repudiation of a contract.

This article, in view of the recent ruling of the Bombay High Court, analyzes the existence of force majeure provisions in commercial contracts, with a primary focus on the position under Indian Law, the engagement of common law doctrine of frustration with the COVID-19 outbreak and the recommendations for parties to consider in order to safeguard their respective positions in view of the aggravating situation.

<strong>Background</strong>

The underlying petition was filed under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1079220/">Section 9</a> of the Indian <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1978?sam_handle=123456789/1362">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a> seeking directions to restrain the Respondent-Bank from encashing the letters of credit. The Petitioners, while relying on Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, submitted, that in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown declared by the Central Government, its contracts with Respondent No. 1 were terminated as unenforceable on account of frustration and impossibility to perform. The contracts had Respondent No. 1 supply certain steel products to the Petitioners, which had to be dispatched from its head office in South Korea. The contracts were subject to the general terms and conditions which included the force majeure clause. Surprisingly, it was the Petitioners who were relying on the force majeure clause, which, in fact, was only applicable to Respondent No. 1.

<strong>Decision</strong>

The Bombay High Court, while dismissing the petition, held that the force majeure clause in the present contract is applicable only to Respondent No. 1 and cannot come to the aid of the Petitioners. The contract terms being on Cost and Freight basis, Respondent No. 1 did comply with its obligations and shipped the goods from South Korea. However, the fact that the Petitioners couldn’t perform their own obligations to pay back, so far as their own purchasers are concerned or the fact that it could suffer damages, is not a factor which can be considered or held against Respondent No. 1.

Even though, the challenge was dismissed, one aspect of the Court’s reasoning merits special attention.

The Court seized the opportunity to correct what it considered to be the wrong standard for treating a ‘force majeure event’ and the application of ‘Doctrine of Frustration’ of Contract on account of COVID-19. According to the Bombay High Court, in any event, "The lockdown was temporary and only for a limited period, making it a bad excuse for the Petitioners so as to resile from their contractual obligations with Respondent No.1 of making payments for their supply." Meaning, that mere hardship in performance of an obligation in view of the COVID-19 pandemic is not a valid objection which can be used against a seller.

<strong>Language of the Force Majeure Clause in the Contract</strong>

In order to invoke force majeure, it is of the utmost importance that performance must be <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/update-force-majeure-provisions-in-the-61505/">objectively impossible</a>, merely difficult or uneconomical performance is not sufficient. Under Indian contract law, the Supreme Court in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/29719380/">Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission</a> clearly laid down that only those events, which are explicitly included in the contract, can excuse a party from performance. Meaning, that a force majeure clause, at all times, will be strictly interpreted.

It is pertinent to note that the force majeure clause did include ‘epidemics’ as per Article 11 of the contract between the parties. Moreover the clause gave the ‘seller’, the ability to terminate the contract or any portion affected thereof by such an event and not the buyer, the petitioners in the instant case. Thereby, it seems, that the Bombay High Court gave fair reasoning by saying that the "Force majeure clause present in the contract cannot come to the aid of the Petitioners, when clearly, it is applicable to Respondent No.1."

<strong>The Absence of a Force Majeure Clause in a Hypothetical Contract</strong>

Where there is absence of a force majeure provision within a contract, there is a possibility to invoke, the doctrine of ‘supervening impossibility’ by way of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act. The provision clearly states, that in case a contract to do an act becomes impossible to perform, by reason of some unavoidable circumstances, which the promisor cannot prevent, it will be unlawful and subsequently, the whole contract becomes void.

Since, the Act does not define the term ‘frustration of contract’, there is only a little relief available to the parties, which is possible by proving the ‘absolute’ impossibility of contractual performance.

<strong>COVID-19: A Supervening Impossibility or Mere Hardship?</strong>

To check whether the magnitudes of the ongoing pandemic will qualify as an impossibility, it is essential to ascertain the threshold set by the Apex Court in this regard. In the landmark case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1214064/">Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram</a>, the Supreme Court held that
<blockquote>"The performance of an act may not be literally ‘impossible’, but may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose which the parties had in mind...the performance of a contract can be said to have become impossible if an untoward event or change of circumstances beyond the contemplation and control of the parties upsets the very foundation upon which the parties rested their bargain."</blockquote>
However, the Supreme Court adopted a hazy approach in <em>Energy Watchdog v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission</em>, where it propounded that parties can invoke the doctrine of frustration and seek exemption from performance if they can validate, that performance of doing such an act will be impracticable and hopeless, keeping in consideration the object and purpose sought and intended to be achieved at the time parties signed the contract.

It is pertinent to note, that recently, in February 2020, the Government of India issued an <a href="https://doe.gov.in/sites/default/files/Force Majeure Clause -FMC.pdf">Office Memorandum</a> regarding the disruption of supply chains on account of coronavirus and whether such an extraordinary event will be covered in force majeure clauses or not. The Government’s Memorandum was constructive in clarifying that the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered as a case of ‘natural calamity’ and that force majeure clauses may be invoked wherever considered suitable.

Therefore, while parties decide to invoke doctrine of frustration, they need to prove that the non-performance was outside reasonable control of the party. So far as <a href="https://www.shearman.com/perspectives/2020/03/covid-19--force-majeure-event">English law</a> is concerned, force majeure provisions are express terms and will not ordinarily be implied into contracts. Much depends on the terms of the contract and the force majeure clause in particular.

<strong>Conclusion and Suggestions</strong>

One needs to bear in mind, that proving ‘frustration’ in an Indian Court of Law would not be easy, clearly, because of the fact that the courts would be only be willing to interpret the outbreak of COVID-19 as mere hardship and in any case, the language of the force majeure clause does not specifically include the pandemic. It really will be a challenging task.

It is advisable for parties to retain evidence, i.e. the supporting documents with regard to the impossibility of performance, delay or notices served, if any. Notices must be served promptly showing that the contract has become impossible to perform or that a force majeure event has occurred. It is also necessary for parties to identify the origin of such non-performance. Reviewing financing and insurance agreements to cover any unexpected losses should be of the highest priority.

For parties ‘receiving’ notices of force majeure, it is necessary for them to determine whether such notice holds consistency with the protections contemplated by the clause, if due process has been followed and whether supporting documents are available. Parties claiming force majeure should be very careful about the evidence of such impossibility, what steps they are taking to prevent such impossibility and the magnitude of that event, since parties making claims are always at a risk of making a wrongful claim.

Most importantly, parties need to determine whether the events associated with COVID-19 prompt the ‘material adverse event’ term in the contract. Meaning, that subsequently, post execution of the contract between the parties, the events took an ‘unexpected turn’. This could be a valid line of argument, although it will again depend on the language as well as specifics of the case.

Lastly, if the contract becomes wasteful on account of the COVID-19 crisis and loses its economic value, or if the other party wishes to repudiate or terminate the contract in order to mitigate or prevent any further losses, it is recommended that parties rely on the ‘termination clause’, ‘entitlement to terminate’ or any such clause as may be specified in such a contract.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Elected public officials who yield to the temptation to reopen the economy, now that efforts made to slow the transmission of the COVID-19 virus appear to have succeeded in preventing this pandemic from overwhelming limited health care resources, risk individual criminal liability unless they order extensive testing of the general population to acquire critical information essential to prevent future harm to all vulnerable people.

Making a political decision at the cost of ignoring science and truth is not a viable defense in a prosecution for criminal negligence causing death. In Canada, everyone is criminally negligent who, in failing to do anything that is his or her duty to do, shows a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. Other jurisdictions have similar laws. An individual who knows that he or she is positive for COVID-19, yet fails to voluntarily isolate and is found to be the cause of the transmission of the virus to another person who dies from the virus, is guilty of criminal negligence causing death and may be sentenced to life in prison. But what about the potential criminal liability of an elected public official, such as the leader of a country, state, province or municipality, who ignores the need for extensive testing for COVID-19 and instead reopens businesses, schools and public gatherings in response to gloomy economic forecasts, resulting in a predictable second and more deadly wave of infections? Is this second wave of infection foreseeable because of a choice not to do extensive testing in conjunction with a staged re-opening or is it an inevitable reality that we must all face, even if extensive testing is done?

Consider the following publicly available facts.

At this time, there is no effective treatment nor a vaccine for COVID-19. The best that can be done is extensive testing of the general population, in order to assess when it is safe to discontinue the use of personal protective equipment (masks, eye shields, gloves, and other biohazard prevention equipment) and to eliminate social distancing. South Korea and Iceland are two countries which used extensive mandatory testing to successfully contain the pandemic and to reopen the economy. A second wave can be avoided, but only if universal mandatory testing is done, to avoid this past week’s recent setback in South Korea.

In Seoul, South Korea, more than 2,100 bars and nightclubs were reopened after the country succeeded in achieving zero new cases domestically. This was accomplished through extensive testing of 15,000 people a day which is the third highest rate in the world for per person testing. The health authorities then tracked the contacts of those who tested positive by recorded cashless transactions, GPS mobile phone history, and CCTV cameras. These measures worked because they were aided by a very high degree of public cooperation to wear masks and to socially distance. This was also aided by smartphone apps that disclose the precise locations of infections to avoid new hotspots as they occur.

Despite this initial success, all these bars and nightclubs in South Korea are now indefinitely closed because of one untested asymptomatic male individual. This young man visited as many as five nightclubs in Itaewon over the May 1, 2020 weekend and transmitted the COVID-19 virus he did not know he was carrying to others who were not wearing masks at those nightclubs. It is believed that he infected 43 nightclub patrons who in turn infected another 11 people who were in contact with them. Contact tracing has now identified a further 7,200 people who may have been exposed to the virus.

This scenario will be repeated in every place where universal COVID-19 testing is not done, and when wearing personal protective equipment is carelessly abandoned.

Asymptomatic super-spreaders account for about 50% of all transmissions of the virus. These carriers of the virus are not being tested. Of all people assumed to be asymptomatic, data collection in China and in the USA reveal that about 75% later develop symptoms. The greatest risk of transmission occurs when the viral load is at its peak, which is when an individual has no symptoms or has the onset of only very mild symptoms.

An effective blood test of all asymptomatic people for the presence of antibodies will provide crucial evidence that elected public officials need to make responsible, informed, prudent decisions to identify places where people are at risk of serious bodily harm or death from COVID-19. When Triumph Foods in Missouri recently tested its employees and contract workers who worked at its meat processing plant, 373 people tested positive for the virus, yet none of them were known to have any symptoms.

What is urgently needed instead is to test all people who have no symptoms to find out where the virus is going and who is a carrier of the virus, so that tracing and supported isolation may be done. Only this way can we learn which schools, workplaces, nightclubs and restaurants may safely reopen.

It is a lie to say that everyone in Canada or the United States who wants a COVID-19 test can get one. Tests here are rationed because reliable test kits are in short supply. A hospitalized sick patient who has symptoms of the virus does not need a test. Treatment remains the same. An effective test of an ill human being will only give information of past transmission. But what of future transmissions? The wrong people are being tested!

With few exceptions, workplaces are not voluntarily obtaining Health Verification Certificates that certify that everyone there has been tested by a sensitive, reliable and accurate laboratory test for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies. If your employer does not require you to be tested, ask your employer if your workplace is safe and if your co-workers will not transmit COVID-19 to you. Find out what the answer is. Without testing, no employer can assure your safety.

Elected public officials in Canada and the United States are now committed to relaxing social distancing measures, lifting the hopes of impatient people who are tired of social isolation and restrictions upon individual liberty. By mid-May, large segments of the economy will re-open in places like British Columbia and the American south, without any testing of those people who need to be tested. Advocates urging people to take their chances point out that the cure of lockdown is worse than the damage already done to the economy and to civil liberty. But do not all members of a free and democratic society have an implied constitutional covenant to collectively care for the weakest and most vulnerable among us? Or will we now reject the integration of moral values with the rule of law in favor of the utilitarian rule of the survival of the fittest?

There is no reason why extensive testing cannot co-exist with saving the economy and reopening society. Why not consider the use of “immunity passports” to designate the bearer as someone who has been tested and is medically verified as safe to be in close proximity to other human beings? Civil liberties can be preserved by laws severely restricting demands to produce this kind of passport.

Without extensive universal testing to gather intelligence about the viral enemy that is surrounding us, and without implementing reasonable and prudent measures such as Health Verification Certificates and Immunity Passports, anyone who entrusts their lives to the blind decisions of elected public officials is in grave mortal danger, unwittingly playing a deadly game of Russian roulette.

It is plain and obvious that it is the public duty of an elected public official is to safeguard the health of the complete population from a pandemic. An elected public official is not immune from criminal liability. Can a decision to relax social distancing and to gradually reverse lockdown orders, without carefully considering the data that can be acquired by extensive testing of the general population, be found by a jury to amount to a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons? The answer is a resounding yes. A prosecutor can make a compelling analogy to a reckless airline pilot who needlessly chooses not to rely on navigation technology when flying blindly in foggy conditions and crashing into a mountainside, killing all on board.

But will those responsible for the laying of criminal charges impartially and courageously do their duty to prosecute criminally negligent public officials? Perhaps. Do elected public officials confidently regard themselves to be above the law? Perhaps. For the rest of us who helplessly watch and wait, our lives depend upon the willingness and humility of elected public officials to listen to and to act upon the wise counsel of experts in bioethics, law and medicine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In September of 2019, Kudankulum Nuclear Power Plant's (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/04/an-indian-nuclear-power-plant-suffered-cyberattack-heres-what-you-need-know/">KNPP</a>) administrative networks were found to be infected with malware, namely a program called DTrack. The National Power Corporation of India (NPCIL), which manages the plant, stated that the infected network and adjoining computers were used for <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nuclear-power-corporation-confirms-malware-in-computer-at-kudankulam-plant-1614115-2019-10-30">administrative services</a> only and thus the malware infecting them doesn’t pose any danger to the plant. But the thought of any nuclear power plant getting attacked is itself problematic and horrifying. And this thought becomes even more worrisome because most of the Nuclear facilities in India are in proximity to densely <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/is-india-cyber-security-ready/article29911679.ece">populated areas</a>. Though this is not the first case of a cyber-attack on a nuclear facility. A worm named <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html">Stuxnet</a> had infiltrated Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility and had affected much of its operation. Thus, the question arises, if any substantial harm is caused to a nuclear facility, then who will be held liable for the damage? In this post, I argue that if there is destruction of civilian property through cyber-attacks on nuclear facilities during an international armed conflict, then it shall constitute a war crime under the framework of International Humanitarian Law (provided that the <em>mens rea</em> part of the offence is also fulfilled).

International Humanitarian Law (<a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/irrc-867-ihl-challenges.pdf">IHL</a>) is a body of international legislation that applies in the situation of armed conflict between two or more states. It is a treaty-based and customary law-based body of rules aimed at protecting people in the time of international armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols (<a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/doc/assets/files/other/icrc_002_0321.pdf">AP</a>) are at the helm of regulating the conduct of armed conflict. But for the constituents elements of war crimes, it is appropriate to use the definition of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/ADD16852-AEE9-4757-ABE7-9CDC7CF02886/283503/RomeStatutEng1.pdf">Rome Statute</a> of the International Criminal Court. Article 8(2)(b)(ii) of the statute shall apply in the current scenario as it provides for commission of War crimes by attacking civilian objects. To satisfy this I will explain all the major elements which need to be satisfied conllectively. The major objective elements are, firstly, an attack must be directed, and secondly, it must be directed towards a civilian object.

Article 49 of AP I gives the meaning of the word "attack" as “Acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or in defense.” Michael Bothe and Waldemar Solf, leading jurists on the issue, noted that the phrase "<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/new-rules-for-victims-of-armed-conflicts-commentary-on-the-two-1977-protocols-additional-to-the-geneva-conventions-of-1949/oclc/871223322">acts of violence</a>" denotes physical force. The <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/international-humanitarian-law-and-challenges-contemporary-armed-conflicts">ICRC documents</a> recognize that cyber operations which result in physical damage to objects that go beyond the computer program or data attacked by means of viruses, worms, etc. could be qualified as "acts of violence." Further, the case of <a href="https://www.icty.org/x/cases/tadic/acdec/en/51002.htm">Prosecutor v. Tadic</a> has held that the violence here refers to the effects and not the means, i.e., the type of weapon used is immaterial. <a href="http://csef.ru/media/articles/3990/3990.pdf">Michael Schmitt</a> writes that such developments mean that acts which have violent consequences would be covered under the ambit of word "attack." Lastly, this point has been further strengthened by the International Court of Justice in its <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/95/095-19960708-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf">advisory opinion</a> which has held that states must never use weapons which are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets. Therefore, cyber-attacks duly come under the meaning of "directing an attack" if it leads to loss of life or any damage to civilian object, or at the least, if its consequences are violent.

Secondly, it is submitted that nuclear power plants, used for generating electricity only are civilian objects, unless proved otherwise. Under the IHL regime, the principle of distinction is employed to differentiate between civilian and military objects. This principle is provided in Article 48 of AP I, and it inculcates a two condition test which has to be proved simultaneously. For any object to be a military object, firstly, nature, location, purpose or use of the objects must make an effective contribution to military action, and secondly, its total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization must offer a definite military advantage in the circumstances ruling at the time. More importantly, The judgement of <a href="https://www.icty.org/en/case/gotovina">Gotovina et al</a>. reveals that even military necessity cannot justify such destruction of civilian objects unless the aforementioned test is fulfilled. Moreover, Article 56 of AP I further curtails the scope of military necessity by stating that protection against the attacks can only be given if there was no alternative other than the attack on the nuclear power station.

Thus, to gain the immunity of international law, a perpetrator has to prove that firstly, the nuclear facility was making a significant contribution to military activities and attacking it has proffered the perpetrator, a definite military advantage over the other. Secondly, it also needs to be shown that there was no other alternative left. Surely the bar set to attain protection under the aegis of IHL for such conduct is very high.

Every crime has two parts in it, i.e., guilty behaviour, and a guilty state of mind. Until now, this post has dealt only with former. For the latter part, it is required that perpetrator must have the intention of directing the attack on a nuclear plant, i.e., a civilian object. I believe it is important to lay down the subjective requirements of the crime to provide more clarity to the issue.

Firstly, the ICC in the decision of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/darfur/abugarda">Abu Garda</a> stated that to prove the requirement of intention to direct an attack, it must be shown that not only there was a presence of standard <em>mens rea</em>, but also of <em>dolus directus</em> of the first degree, or concrete intent. The same views have been echoed by many jurists in the past, including <a href="https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780198739777.001.0001/law-9780198739777">William Schabas</a>. Secondly, it also has to be proved that perpetrator must have the intention that the object of the attack is civilian property. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (<a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/SAS-KOR-Article-5-Public-Report-ENG-05Jun2014.pdf">ICTY</a>) has ruled that the attack must have been conducted intentionally and for the perpetrator it was impossible not to know that civilian objects were being targeted. Lastly, if it is an international armed conflict, it must be shown that perpetrator was aware of the circumstances that established the existence of an armed conflict.

Thus, it is pertinent to note that the differences between the quantum of guilt adduced for the various subjective elements of the crime. In the first case, where it has to be proved that perpetrator had the intention to direct the attacks, the bar to prove the guilt for the crime has been set very high, i.e., concrete intention to direct the attacks must be shown against the perpetrator. Whereas, the burden to prove the intention with respect to the object of the attack is much lower. From the loose language appended by the court, it seems as if even if the perpetrator had reason to know about the object, but for his negligence, recklessness or otherwise, was unaware of it, then liability would still be imputed to him.

In today’s world, cyber-attacks are becoming a convenient mode of causing violence, loss of economy, destruction of properties, etc. Though attacks on civilian objects such as nuclear facilities find their place in the Additional Protocols, cyber-crimes, being relatively new, are still in a nascent stage with limited laws regulating and penalizing them. Thus, it becomes pertinent for laws to be interpreted in such a way so that these modes of violence can be covered under the ambit of existing framework of this legal regime, or alternatively a new code shall be put forth by jurists so as to inculcate changes in the legal framework with changes in society. As cyber-attacks are just a means and not the end of conflict mechanism and simultaneously law requires the ends to be violent, cyber-attacks come under the ambit of the term "attack." Thus, cyber-attacks on nuclear installations are very well covered by IHL. This interpretation is resonated by many jurists, especially, by Michael Schmitt, in his most exemplar work, <a href="http://csef.ru/media/articles/3990/3990.pdf">Tallinn Manual</a>. Therefore, any cyber-attack on a nuclear power plant, which results in the violent consequence, such as destruction of property or lives, would be a war crime, if it is coupled with the requisite intention of the perpetrator provided by the law.

		<title>Testing Human Rights Through Human Gene Patenting in COVID-19</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[COVID-19 or the novel coronavirus has emerged as a global threat that has changed the world order and has challenged all the predetermined notions of societal existence. This is the point in history that will be studied in the future for the decisions made with respect to preserving human dignity and the principles of equity that are adopted by societies across the world. One of these challenges has surfaced in the world of human rights through a rather unlikely source. The sudden surge in the demand for a vaccine has seen the biotechnology industry rush to innovation and testing, which, if it results in any form of medications or vaccines, would likely lead to the filing of patent claims. These biotechnological advances heavily rely on human gene testing and its patentability. An age old debate rekindles every time the issue of human gene patenting becomes a point of discussion and it inevitably ropes in the issues of human rights and the prevention of exploitation.

COVID-19 has forced scientists to study and test the possible vaccinations from all across the world, which has inevitably motivated the scientists in France to suggest the testing of the vaccines on the people living in South Africa. This sparked a significant outrage over the internet, calling the proposal out as "racist". But this only begs the question, where do the principles of human rights stand in the event of such a global catastrophe. One such issue that needs to be highlighted is the issue of human gene patenting and the bioethics that surround the field.

Biotechnology is an extensive field covering almost all of biological study that attaches itself with technology and the development of the living processes through its application on various organisms and life forms. Patent laws across the world have tried to balance bioethics and the patentability of various potential inventions. One of the majorly accepted criteria for establishing patentability is novelty, inventiveness and industrial application. For example, Section 3 of Indian Patents act, lists the exceptions to patentability which include various types of life forms, parts of animals or plants, or subject matter that may be harmful for humans, animals or the environment. The major principle that governs patent laws is public order. <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/447/303/">Diamond v. Chakrabarty</a> established an important precedent, in which the genetically modified organism used for the decomposition of crude oil was initially rejected and then later was allowed by the appeals court, establishing the basic components of inventions required for patentability.

One of the major qualifications of genetic material to be considered an invention is isolation from its naturally occurring habitat through a human intervention which results in a product that has industrial application. This should mean that any naturally occurring substance that is not patentable otherwise, for it is a mere discovery, becomes patentable when human intervention isolates the genetic material and makes it industrially useful. The technicalities of patent laws do reflect the morality of various regions of the world and hence, determine perspectives of human rights on the issue. In developed countries like USA and EU countries, one constantly accepted trend is that of acceptance and the promotion in the field of biotechnological patenting. In cases like <em>Diamond v. Chakrabarty</em> and <a href="https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/case-study-association-for-molecular-pathology-v-myriad-genetics-inc/">Myriad Insdustires</a>, the USPTO has generously argued that since human intervention is required to assimilate and understand the information that is stored and coded inside the proteins of DNA, it makes the attempt a ‘human intervention’ and hence renders the gene patentable, since it is isolated from the body. This stands in direct conflict with the patent laws of many developing regions like Brazil, India and Southeast Asia. Most of these laws suggest that such genetic material is a part of a natural object, i.e. humans. And any such discovery should necessarily mean it is just a discovery. Brazilian patent laws under Article 10 have strictly termed organisms, genomes and biological material as non-patentable. India has passed specific legislation called the Plants Varieties and Farmers Rights Protection Act to stop the patenting and monopolization of crop varieties, and have explicitly stated that human parts and their bodies are non-patentable.

This clear and different stand between developed countries and the previously colonized countries give us an idea of the intention that should precede such judgments. These countries tend to be careful when it comes to opening their vulnerable societies to the capitalist regimes of developed nations, especially when it comes to the involvement of human bodies. The commercialization of the human genome has been rejected by a lot of scientists hailing from countries like Bermuda and other places, yet the developed nations have pushed for the patentability of human genetic material, deepening the controversy with the birth of Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which has been alleged to advocate majorly for the interests of the developed countries. This has evolved the concept of "biopiracy" which has gained a significant momentum. Statistical evidence from the Rural Advancement Foundation International (<a href="https://www.avenuemail.in/opinion/columns/dilemma-intellectual-property-rights-developing-countries/93095/">RAFI</a>) suggests that biopiracy is committed by companies from the developed countries on the population of developing nations.

It is absolutely possible for any legal decision or legal principle to be immoral even if it stays consistent with legal precedent. Human gene patenting is feared to exploit and exacerbate the inequality between the rich and the poor, although it would be a stretch to suggest that human genetic patenting could be an equivalent of slavery. But it is very interesting to note this, when adopted in times of crisis, like COVID-19, which has already forced the Governments across the world to limit human liberties for the larger public good, any such questions of Human Testing in laboratories across the world would not encroach upon the boundaries of Human Rights. There is absolutely no guarantee that in a world that is ready to sacrifice Human Rights to save the public health through autocratic or incompetent decisions, could not overlook issues such as ‘Biopiracy’ and the exploitation of Human Gene Patenting. All these issues only make it more imperative for intellectuals to discuss this issue again.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump in recent days unveiled his latest tactic to clamp down on sanctuary jurisdictions. Having failed in his earlier efforts, the President now seeks to withhold the next round of federal stimulus funding from sanctuary jurisdictions in order to strong-arm them into changing their policies. Congress should categorically reject this hostile move and, instead, once again reiterate what it has already made clear: The President cannot use federal funding as bait to compel sanctuary jurisdictions to change.

President Trump has long held sanctuary jurisdictions in his cross-hairs. He sees these jurisdictions, which restrict their officers from cooperating with federal immigration officers, as undermining his own immigration priorities. From the earliest days of his campaign and all throughout his presidency, President Trump has railed against sanctuary jurisdictions and sought to bring them in line with his brutal immigration policies.

But his efforts have been crude and patchy. He started just five days into his presidency, when he ordered executive agencies to withhold all federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions. His own administration quickly saw that he overshot—that the President had no authority to do this, at least without Congress’s say-so. After all, Congress, and not the President, has the power of the purse under our Constitution. This includes the power to impose conditions on federal funds, like a condition to drop sanctuary policies in order to receive federal funding.

So the Attorney General narrowed the policy. The Attorney General informed sanctuary jurisdictions that if they failed to drop their sanctuary policies, they would lose funding under just one program, the Byrne JAG grant, designed to provide federal money for state and local law enforcement. In particular, the Attorney General told sanctuary jurisdictions that they must give notice to federal immigration officers when they planned to release an alien from their custody, and provide access to federal immigration officers to aliens within their prisons. In addition, the Attorney General required sanctuary jurisdictions to certify that they complied with a federal law that prohibited state and local jurisdictions from not cooperating with federal immigration officers.

But this approach had its own problems. The courts slapped these conditions, ruling that the Attorney General lacked statutory authority to impose them. The courts said that neither the Byrne JAG program nor the Attorney General’s more general authority to administer grants authorized the Attorney General to impose these conditions. Again: the Legislative Branch has the power of the purse, not the Executive Branch.

The Attorney General tried to wiggle around these rulings by imposing new conditions under different statutory authorities. But just last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held again that the Attorney General lacked statutory authority—and more, that Congress repeatedly rejected efforts to include authority in legislation. The court saw right through the Attorney General’s improvised gambit and even compared the Administration’s ever-evolving approach to a game of whack-a-mole.

After over three years of failed policy, and having lost overwhelmingly in the courts, now the President seeks to enlist Congress in his petty and capricious attempts to clamp down on sanctuary jurisdictions. He does this by proposing to require jurisdictions to disavow sanctuary policies as a condition of receiving federal stimulus money. This approach has its own constitutional problems. For one, this would effectively compel sanctuary jurisdictions to tow the Trump Administration line on immigration policies, in direct violation of the Tenth Amendment and federalism principles. For another, stimulus funding has nothing to do with sanctuary policies, and linking them also violates the Tenth Amendment and federalism policies.

It’s time for Congress to put a stop to the President’s spit-balling policies and constitutional violations. Congress must tell the President, again, that he cannot use federal funding to compel sanctuary jurisdictions to change.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Commercial arbitration is currently the preferred mode of dispute resolution for complex disputes. The growing popularity of arbitration has led parties to include arbitration clauses for all large transactions and commercial agreements. An increasing number of government entities and public sector ventures include arbitration clauses in their standard form contracts. These entities are also regularly parties to arbitrations.

The existing law relating to international arbitration was considered archaic and changes were indispensable. This was the reason that in 1995, the Minister for Law, Justice and Company Affairs introduced, in the Upper House of Parliament, a bill to implement the UNCITRAL Model Law and to provide statutory recognition for the process of conciliation. Thus, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 was enacted. The Indian Arbitration Act heavily corresponds to the recommendations flowing from the UNCITRAL Model Law in that all countries signing it have to give consideration.

There have been many amendments to change the Arbitration landscape in India. These have added quite a few imperative changes to the Arbitration Act to increase its efficiency, speed, and credibility. Some of the important additions to the Arbitration Act include:
<ul>
 	<li>Discouraging the filing of frivolous applications related to arbitration awards;</li>
 	<li>Discouraging the delays in arbitration creating an efficient cost regime;</li>
 	<li>The imposition of time limits;</li>
 	<li>Encouraging institutional arbitration;</li>
 	<li>Limiting court intervention at the pre and post-arbitration stages;</li>
</ul>
The executive branch has sought to bring about efficiency in arbitration involving government entities by encouraging ministries to comply with arbitration awards, pending any proposed challenge, in the interests of ensuring cash flow, particularly in relation to large disputes.

However, with the positive amendments come disputes that are more complex. The healthcare industry has been plagued with such disputes in recent times. Some significant ones are:
<ul>
 	<li>Disputes among members of physician groups or between different hospitals and other staff;</li>
 	<li>False Claims Act (FCA) and other fraud cases against hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, drug manufacturers etc.;</li>
 	<li>Complex disputes arising from mergers and acquisitions;</li>
 	<li>Reimbursement disputes involving government agencies, pharmacies, physicians, doctors;</li>
 	<li>Risk management controversies and Personal Accident Insurance;</li>
</ul>
The disputes are never ending. This is the perfect opportunity for the healthcare industry to transition from traditional litigation to Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms.

<strong>Alternative Dispute Resolution in the Healthcare Industry</strong>

There is a continuous debate about the ongoing healthcare crisis in several countries including India. These effects are felt throughout the system and the entire economy. These legal costs are passed on to the consumers, which intensifies patient dissatisfaction in the healthcare industry. This is where an inexpensive, fast-moving lawsuit option also known as "Alternate Dispute Resolution" process come into play.

Various healthcare providers and insurers are choosing Alternative Dispute Resolution processes- mostly mediation and arbitration- as a way to address increasing legal costs. By including a pre-dispute arbitration and mediation clause in healthcare admission agreements and contracts, the providers and insurers agree to route future disputes through these processes instead of lawsuits.

<strong>Different Models of Alternative Dispute Resolution in the Healthcare Industry</strong>

<strong>The Veteran Affairs (VA) Model</strong>

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) instituted this model. A policy where a full disclosure agreement was paramount to the model. This includes complete disclosure of facts related to the error and all actions taken to mitigate it. The disclosure also contained an apology from the Chief of Staff accepting responsibility for the adverse event. Compensation in this model includes corrective medical or surgical action and/or monetary awards. Between 1987 and 2003, only 3 out of 170 settlements resulted in trials. This shows that model suits the needs of the patient and is frequently chosen over traditional litigation.

<strong>The University of Michigan Model</strong>

The University of Michigan Health System adopted this policy in 2001. This model is based on fair compensation when the medical expenses are unreasonable and led to the patient’s injury. It also emphasizes learning from the mistakes and experiences of the patient. This model includes an open discussion related to the error caused by the medical staff. This disclosure policy has been largely successful and has reduced the average cost per case from $48,000 to $21,000.

<strong>The Pew Mediation and ADR Model</strong>

This model was adopted in four Pennsylvania healthcare systems in 2002. It mainly focuses on improving communication between the physicians and the patients in distress, briefing disclosure conversations, use of mediation to settle potential claims. This process facilitates discussion and increases the transparency between the physician and the patient. This ecosystem helps the parties to explore monetary and non-monetary solutions. Only two cases have been filed in the current two-year period and the settlement between the parties was satisfactory.

<strong>The Chicago Rush Medical Centre Model</strong>

This model was developed at the Chicago’s Rush Medical Centre in 1995 and is the most widely used model in mediation. This process begins with an early exchange of pre-mediation agreement submissions, brief presentations from both sides, and deciding caucus procedures. The mediators are selected by the plaintiff which acts as an immense motivation for them to take part in the process. An official list of trained medical malpractice lawyers are presented in the process and the plaintiff has the liberty to choose any one of them. Over 80% of the cases that used this model were successful and were resolved within 1 year of filing the complaint.

<strong>The Internal Neutral Mediator Model</strong>

This model uses an ombudsman to resolve healthcare issues. An ombudsman is a neutral party trained to participate in disclosures and lays down the route to solve the ongoing issue. The National Naval Medical Centre (NNMC) in Maryland was the first acute care hospital to start an ombudsman program. The ombudsman handled 82 cases in the first 18 months and a majority were solved within 10 hours with no further claims on those cases.

<strong>Choosing Mediation and Arbitration over Lawsuit Litigation</strong>

Alternative Dispute Resolution processes provide way more benefits than normal litigation. For the purpose of this article, we would cover some of them.

<strong>ADR is Less Time-Consuming</strong>

Part of the cost-savings in mediation and arbitration is related to the fact that they are much faster than traditional litigation. Various studies have indicated that arbitration hearings require two to four days as compared to several weeks for court hearings in traditional litigation. The same study showed that medical malpractice disputes took 19 months on average for medical malpractice arbitration and 33 months for normal litigation. Recently, The Corporate Legal Times published that 78% of attorneys find arbitration and mediation faster than traditional litigation.

<strong>ADR is Less Expensive</strong>

Studies have shown that medical malpractices disputes are costly if, solved through traditional litigation. One study showed that the cost of mediation and arbitration could be as low as one-fourth the cost of traditional litigation. Duke University Law School’s Private Adjudication Centre reported that arbitration fees are far more reasonable than going the traditional way.

<strong>Mediation and Arbitration is Fair </strong>

Various commentators have concluded that individuals do well in arbitration compared to litigation, if not better. Researchers Michael Delikat and Morris Kleiner reported that complaints in the Southern District of New York prevailed 46 percent of the time in arbitration versus 34 percent in Court. This trend is also changing in India. Individuals have started receiving monetary awards in arbitration similar to those in courts. 93% of people in a group study believed that their cases where handled fairly and without any bias in arbitration and mediation.

<strong>Drafting the Perfect ADR Agreement</strong>

The ideal ADR agreement will have certain key needs that we have identified here:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Open to Judicial Review- </strong>There is no point in an arbitration agreement if it cannot be enforced in the Court. Drafting an agreement that is open to judicial scrutiny is imperative.</li>
 	<li><strong>Beneficiary Clause- </strong>Arbitration agreements between "businesses" and "consumers" are frequently challenged on the grounds that they are unconscionable. Courts have recently rejected these challenges and have routinely enforced these arbitration agreements. They are much more inclined to do so because of the procedural and substantive safeguards that guard the consumers against unfairness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Covering All Disputes and Making it Mutual-</strong> It is crucial that both the patient and the provider are bound by the agreement. It is equally important that any disputes regarding the enforceability and interpretation of the agreement, will be decided by the arbitrator.</li>
 	<li><strong>Availability of Legal Remedies- </strong>Legal remedies that are available in Court should also be available through arbitration and mediation. This is especially imperative when both parties do not have equal bargaining power.</li>
 	<li><strong>Providing an “Opt-Out” Provision- </strong>Allowing the consumers to "opt-out" of the provisions within a certain period of signing, such as 10 days, is key.</li>
 	<li><strong>Educating Patients- </strong>Educating them about what they are getting in return- a fair, cost effective method may serve to balance any hesitation in signing the ADR agreement. We should consider offering them the "Patient’s guide" that many regulatory bodies provide.</li>
 	<li><strong>Making the Agreement Bold and Understandable- </strong>The agreement should make it clear to the patient that he or she is foreclosing the option of a judge and instead agreeing to an alternative forum.</li>
 	<li><strong>Invoking the Federal Arbitration Act-</strong> Invoking the Federal Arbitration Act ensures; that  healthcare organizations can use the same agreement in several States.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Implications</strong>

Early disclosure and apology programs, mediation, arbitration, and negotiation are among the forms of ADR that have been successfully implemented in the healthcare industry. However, certain limitations arise. First are the central data banks, such as the National Practitioners’ Data Bank (NPDB), that record all malpractice claims against a physician. This becomes a part of the physician’s permanent record and hampers his/her ability to obtain licenses and other staff privileges. This situation may be compared to a driver with multiple speeding tickets and other violations who has to pay higher premiums due to this. Another major problem is the distrust in the system. It is a relatively new concept and still evolving. The main problem arising is that it forces parties to an internal, inconsistent form of mandatory and non-binding ADR that frustrated the parties. They found it to be ineffective and time wasting.

However, this trend is changing and the success of existing ADR models is promising. ADR provides the potential to promote disclosures among the parties, improves the patient’s safety, and reduces cost. ADR in the healthcare industry presents a great promise for the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Health and safety are the highest concern today for all as the ongoing impact of COVID-19 continues to expand every day. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also has the unavoidable and related effect of delaying existing contested settlement processes in both the national courts and in arbitration. The trials were postponed or moved as far as possible. When lockdowns are extended into the near future, however, hearings will also have to take place. Many national courts and arbitration institutions are now aware of these problems and are looking for solutions particularly technology to address them. But a question arises here: can COVID-19 be an opportunity for the judiciary to make use of its new technological progress to streamline processes and reduce the delays in justice that have been growing worldwide over the past few years? The following article is a brief overview of the key actions taken in legal proceedings worldwide. It covers courts in the following countries: India, the UK, the USA, France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, The Netherlands and China(mainland). Basic information about the following international arbitration institutions is also included: the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA), the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) and the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

<strong>India</strong>

The full bench of the Supreme Court of India has, in its application by video order dated 23 March 2020, extended the restriction to petitions, applications, appeals and all other proceedings in the context of further decisions before all courts, tribunals and administrative bodies in the country with effect from 15 March 2020. Limited operations were adopted by national courts. Different courts, along with a limited number of judges, have given orders restricting the operation of courts to matters of urgency. Typically, it is considered urgent to deal with only matters involving life, imminent dispossession or destruction of property. Most courts follow restricted entry procedures and, unless inevitable, access to courts is prohibited by private parties or litigants.

<strong>The United Kingdom</strong>

Tribunals and courts have consolidated their function into fewer buildings. Judges have been dismissed by the Lord Chief Justice. The courts of the judges must, however, begin urgent work. Increased use of video/audio hearings in criminal trials and judicial appeals is provided for in the current Government Coronavirus Law. A special procedure is followed in the Business &amp; Property Courts. QB Masters perform a range of actions, including demands from parties to postpone non-urgent proceedings and warn of e-filing delays. On visits to their buildings the Supreme Court issued an update that indicates the court actually is operating as usual, but this is subject to change. A notice outlining several provisional changes was released by the Queen's Bench.

<strong>The USA</strong>

In May, the US Supreme Court announced that, in certain cases postponed in March and April, it will hear oral arguments remotely. Different measures were taken by other courts of appeal. For example, all cases scheduled for review during the sitting in April and May 2020 are being carried out remotely in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Furthermore, during this period, no physical hearings will be held and rules are changed so that parties are no longer obliged to file paper copies of documents. Courts have postponed or canceled jury trials in most states. A number of federal court houses have been shut down because either the virus was found in a building or because local judges shut the courthouse down preemptively to protect public health.

<strong>France</strong>

The French courts have been closed since 16 March 2020, except in essential disputes such as "pre-trial and judicial review proceedings," "immediate appearances," "appearances before the investigating judge and a custody judge" and "hearings of the sentence enforcement judge for emergency management."

<strong>Germany</strong>

The courts are still functioning. Nevertheless, in-person hearings are up to six months delayed. The tribunals have some geographical variations with respect to the particular treatment of these delays. Oral inquiries are usually held only for matters of urgency. In the case of German civil law proceedings, video conferencing is rarely used. This is partly because the courts do not have the capacity to do so and partly because the law does not have application if the parties or the testimonials are outside Germany.

<strong>The United Arab Emirates</strong>

On 17 March 2020, Decision No 30 of 2020 by the Dubai courts Managing Director declared that all current cases and court cases would be temporarily postponed until 16 April 2020. Since April 19, 2020, the Dubai courts have reported that all hearings are conducted electronically using Microsoft Teams. This helps parties to attend video-conferencing hearings. All new lawsuits are also being filed electronically.

The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Court is still open, but all staff work remotely. The DIFC courts and offices of the Registry were closed physically by 26 April 2020. Nonetheless, hearings are expected to continue. The DIFC Court said in its most recent update that all the hearings held after 17 March 2020 will generally be held via teleconference. The court calls on practitioners to use e-bundling. The DIFC has long allowed both judges and supporters to attend video conferencing hearings when it is considered necessary to do so with the approval of the court.

<strong>Australia</strong>

The High Court in Canberra has announced that the High Court of Australia will not sit or circuit in Canberra in April, May and June following the introduction of policies limiting travel and meetings and remote working arrangements. Future sittings are scheduled for consideration in June. The Court has stated that it will continue to deliver judgments and deal with special leave applications and will hear urgent matters using video links including hearings necessary in individual records. "Our counters are closed but we are still functioning," is what has been announced by the Australian Federal Court and a Special Information Measures Note (SMIN-1) has been issued which establishes provisions for the continued operation of this Federal Court in Australia during the COVID-19 outbreak. Alternative solutions including hearing problems on paper, by phone or other remote access systems are being used as far as possible.

<strong>Canada</strong>

Appeals and applications continue to be heard by the Court of Appeal, but they will not be heard in person after 23 March 2020. The Court's Pandemic Answer Plan is being amended to respond to COVID-19 concerns and challenges in order to reduce the negative impact on court and justice operations. The Court has introduced Emergency Practice Directions that will remain in place until they have been removed. All disputes before a single judicial judge are heard in a teleconference and all appeals and demands are electronically heard (via videoconferencing or telephone) before a trialogue.

<strong>Hong Kong</strong>

On 29 January 2020, cases in the Hong Kong domestic courts were postponed for the so-called General Adjourned Period (GAP). Nevertheless, the length of the GAP remained unknown. At the end of March, however, initial hopes were to return to normal operations. The Court gave some insight into the acts of the courts to enhance court facilities without sacrificing health or safety in a declaration made by the Chief Justice of the Court's final appeal. Apart from the basic constructive case management steps, the Court considered actively extending the range of the hearings (beyond just urgently or essentially) by allowing telephone, video or similar visual aid submissions and making general use of technology.

<strong>The Netherlands</strong>

The courts have been closed from 17 March 2020 until (at least) 6 April 2020. As a result, during this period there will be no court hearings except for urgent cases. For example, where a delay of the decision of the court will adversely affect the rights of the defendant or a litigant, the Netherlands' judicial authorities have confirmed that a matter does not qualify as "urgent." Those "emergency cases" include the hearing of requests for bankruptcy, criminal suspected custody and some family law (e.g., non-home investment) cases. Only in extraordinary circumstances may a hearing take place in disaster relief proceedings. However, as far as possible, written protocols are continued. All disputes before a single judicial judge are heard at a teleconference and all appeals and demands are electronically heard (via videoconferencing or telephone) before a trialogue. A notice was issued for the public and the profession, outlining the problems and the course of action of the Court.

<strong>China (mainland)</strong>

The Supreme People's Court had ordered courts at all levels to direct litigants to file cases or mediate disputes online at the height of the outbreak in February and to allow judges to use on-line litigation platforms entirely, including for the filing and delivery of rulings, to ensure improved legal services and safety to litigants and their lawyers. In many provinces and cities, the Supreme People's Court has been promoting "mobile micro court" usage on the WeChat social media site to help courts hold internet trials. In China, there are three "internet courts" which deal with online litigation from the filing of a case to the issuance of judgment documents.

<strong>International Arbitration Associations</strong>

<strong>Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC)</strong>

HKIAC's buildings are functioning and open to hearings and meetings at Two Exchange Square, Central and Hong Kong. HKIAC introduced protections for staff and customers. Front-line service staff have been equipped with face masks. Improved center cleaning/sterilization and temperature control of all entry-level individuals has been implemented. Such programs provide state-of-the-art video-conferencing facilities that can confer at up to eight locations. It is also fitted with a high-speed audio conference network that supports up to 30 line communication in more than 80 countries. HKIAC is also taking into account the policy of the Hong Kong government that all persons arriving from all countries outside China (effective 19 March 2020) and mainland China (effective 8 February 2020) must be placed in a mandatory quarantine. This has allowed anyone who is subject to this policy not to join HKIAC for a minimum time of 14 days following their arrival in Hong Kong and thereafter only if they are symptomatic. A Health Statement Form must be completed for all visitors coming to the centre. HKIAC invites parties to make the use of their virtual hearing services, which is significant step.

<strong>International Chamber Of Commerce (ICC)</strong>

The outbreak immediately prompted the ICC to advise stakeholders, tribunals and other neutrals to "remain assessed and consider addressing their possible implications in ongoing litigation, if and when necessary." While its own staff work remotely and all meetings at ICC offices worldwide are still on schedule, they remain operational. The parties can decide, or even the tribunal may order some (or even all) telephone or video witnesses instead of requesting a witness to attend the hearing in person. They may also determine whether video or telephone conferences are to be used or what issues should be addressed in doing so. The ICC has released its Coronavirus Recommendations for Business in response to the pandemic, which define key business measures to reduce the virus's spread. This involve substituting human meetings with virtual meetings. Where it is no longer possible to attend hearings directly, parties can voluntarily use technology instead.

<strong>The Australian Centre For International Commercial Arbitration (ACICA)</strong>

ACICA has adopted its precautionary protocol COVID-19 (Coronavirus) to prevent high-risk individuals from taking part in person in any ACICA hearing. The Continuity Plan of ACICA is aimed at ensuring that services can continue, if necessary remotely, including mobile, video and webinars. Although not specifically discussed in the ACICA Regulation, since before the coronavirus, the ACICA has taken up Electronic Dispute Settlement and incorporated in it a draft Order to Use Electronic Dispute Settlement Technology, which offers an alternative of on-line hearings for video conferencing. This draft order states that all temporary and final arbitration proceedings will take place in video conferences and is appropriate for parties to determine conduct and the integrity of witnesses.

<strong>London Court Of International Arbitration (LCIA)</strong>

The LCIA stated that, although they anticipate being operational, they require all contacts to be online or over the telephone to deal with matters as normal. The LCIA rules cover the risk that the proceedings do not take place in person, as long as it involves proceedings. In its Guidance Note to the Arbitrariness, the LCIA acknowledges that it may be acceptable for hearings to be held through telephone or video conference rather than in person. Article 19 [Oral Hearings] states that "as a matter of nature, a hearing can be done through video conferencing." The court should also consider "whether any or all those who are expected to attend a meeting or hearing may be able to do that through video conferencing rather than in person (for example, if a witness is not able to travel because of health problems).

<strong>American Arbitration Association (AAA)</strong>

The AAA International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA-ICDR) continues to be active and operational, but AAA-ICDR hearings will not be conducted until at least June 2020. The AAA case management team meets parties and arbitrators to negotiate alternate solutions, such as video use, teleconferences or adjournments. As of April 25, the recommendation "to discuss with one another any questions about their involvement" for parties and arbitrators was "promptly". Those with symptoms were prohibited from attending in-person hearings. The AAA Rules provide for the use of "Alternative media such as film, screen, telephone conferences and means other than an individual presentation...when considered necessary...[may be used for] the presentation of facts." The AAA boasts an electronic archive, teleconference, Internet contact and other means, in order to make it possible to provide a "completely fair chance for all." Consequently, the AAA recognizes that these are appropriate times in which viable alternatives to personal hearings are permitted (indeed required). The AAA published some guidance on how virtual listening, Zoom, and a Virtual Hearing Order (VHO) might be used through a video conference.

<strong>Accelerating Justice and Curtailment of Delays?</strong>

Justice systems in governments worldwide are some of the most important organizations. They give nations a mechanism that seeks to be as equitable and possible to those involved with dealing with criminal activity and civil disputes. These systems are sadly not always perfect. The history of cases that hold courts, hearings and other court proceedings running at a slow pace is one of the main challenges facing justice systems worldwide. Potential suspects also have to wait months or even years for trials. This gives rise to all kinds of problems from public security issues to prison overcrowding and much more.

Fortunately, innovations have a way to boost the performance of all forms of procedures and court rooms may benefit greatly. In the courtroom and judicial systems worldwide, video conferencing is being implemented as a revolutionary way of speeding up procedures. The benefits of video conferencing are numerous – users are able to express more thoughts in a more naturally occurring atmosphere for one thing. It also saves money otherwise spent on transportation and travel. It also enhances protection. If any prisoner is known to be violent or mentally ill, it is a much better way of going about trials and hearings to hold him or her in jail and link them to the court room with a video conference. It isn't just straightforward to use video conferencing in court rooms and jails.

The reality is that most courts often struggle with the pressure of large case backlogs and other problems. Anything that can be used to accelerate matters is a boon to this governmental business. This is why video conferencing has made such an significant change. Digital communications technology can improve the speed and efficiency of court proceedings, rather than the current model of waiting for a specific date or period when police officers are available to bring suspects or parties into a hearing or court case. The consequence seems to be a justice system that deals more efficiently and more effectively with hearings every day. Smart use of the technology will enhance the court process worldwide substantially

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

There will certainly be groups taking advantage of the current pandemic to unnecessarily postpone court trials or arbitration proceedings. As such, it can well become mandatory and commonplace to apply for permission to proceed via video or telephone conferencing. When parties do not take this action themselves, or an initiative of this type is illegitimately challenged, courts or tribunals usually have the power to make reasonable orders to allow it. Some dispute resolution procedures will be inevitably disrupted by the current crisis. Video-conferencing is a tool that is available to alleviate some of the disturbance, while causing the parties minimal harm. It is normally provided for under the law and technology makes it possible. The only remaining thing is that parties accept its usage and dispel the myths of its inadequacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The international trade of goods across borders is conducted within a complex web of international and domestic regulations and involves a complex set of arrangements between sellers/exporters and buyers/importers. In times of a pandemic such as COVID-19, the relation between sellers and buyers becomes complicated due to contractual breaches. Both domestic and international courts and arbitration organizations have yet to witness an array of international trade law disputes. However, in the mean time, this article looks into the important question of whether there are any exemptions from liability under the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) in a situation where the seller breaches the contract by failing to deliver the goods due to COVID-19.

CISG applies where an international sale of goods is at issue and either the law of a contracting state applies, or the parties have agreed on the application of CISG. On the question of exemption from liability for non-performance, Article 79 of CISG provides the guidance. Article 79 of the CISG provides for exemption from liability for damages if the damages were caused by an impediment beyond the control of the party claiming the exemption and restrict an undue or harsh result by limiting strict liability. Here, exemption means that an aggrieved party shall not be entitled to claim damages for breach of a contract. Article 79 of CISG provides only for the exemption from damages and leaves other claims unaffected.

Article 79(1) provides for several requirements for a party to be exempt from liability for damages: (1) an impediment to the performance of a contract has arisen; (2) the party’s non-performance was due to the impediment; (3) the impediment was beyond the control of the party claiming the exemption; (4) the party could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract; and (5) the party could not reasonably be expected to have avoided or overcome the impediment or its consequences.

The existence of an impediment is a prerequisite to an exemption according to the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). However, Article 79 does not state what an impediment is or what qualifies as an impediment. It is not defined in Article 79 or elsewhere in the CISG. The term impediment is broad and vague.

In the 1996 CLOUT case, the German Court held that an "Impediment must be an unmanageable risk or a totally exceptional event, such as a force majeure, economic impossibility or something excessively onerous" and, in 2002, suggested that the non-existence of means to prevent or detect a lack of conformity in the goods may well sufficiently constitute an impediment under Article 79. This approach by the German Court suggests that impediment within Article 79 aligns with the civil law concept of force majeure. The force majeure concept has its origins in French law where there are express force majeure provisions in the French civil code which excuse contractual performance where events have happened outside the parties’ control which could not have been foreseen at the time of contracting and which could not have been avoided by appropriate measures. The parallel concept in the Common law system is that of frustration.

The bigger question to look into is whether the COVID-19 pandemic is sufficient to attract the application of "impediment." Reviewing CISG cases leads to the conclusion that an event that makes the performance objectively impossible can qualify as an impediment within the meaning of Article 79. Scholars’ views on the meaning of an impediment further support this notion. Schlechtriem states that an economic event that prevents performance in its entirety is an impediment. John O. Honnold states that the exemption should be confined to an impediment that prevents the performance of a contract and Chengwei Liu states that "greater interference of States in international commercial relations e.g., embargo, blockade, war and, more recently, export prohibitions" can constitute impediment.

It can be established that the current pandemic may constitute an impediment under Article 79. However, for the seller to seek exemption under Article 79, the seller has to prove that the non-performance is due to the pandemic and that it was beyond the control of the seller, and the seller could not have foreseen the impediment due to the outbreak. Furthermore, the seller also needs to prove that the pandemic occurred after the conclusion of the contract.

Given the nature of the pandemic, it likely is temporary and pursuant to Article 79(3) CISG, temporary impediments will only temporarily excuse the obligor for the period for which the impediment exists. Although Article 79 provides a safe spot to sellers in international trade, its successful application, due to COVID-19, depends on a case by case basis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, which is a data privacy code, similar to the GDPR in the EU, has recently been passed by the Union Cabinet, and has been presented before the Lok Sabha for determination of enactment. In light of this, I seek to specifically analyze the important provision pertaining to data localization that is present in this bill and the Justice Sri Krishna Committee report which ultimately resulted in the formulation of this bill. Specifically, Section 40 of the bill states:
<blockquote>40. Restrictions on Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Data. —

(1) Every data fiduciary shall ensure the storage, on a server or data centre located in India, of at least one serving copy of personal data to which this Act applies.

(2) The Central Government shall notify categories of personal data as critical personal data that shall only be processed in a server or data centre located in India.

(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Central Government may notify certain categories of personal data as exempt from the requirement under subsection (1) on the grounds of necessity or strategic interests of the State.

(4) Nothing contained in sub-section (3) shall apply to sensitive personal data.</blockquote>
<strong>Analysis</strong>

In today’s geo-political ecosystem, personal data behaves like a subject of trade, analogous to currency. This directly leads to a demand for capturing data by nation states. Cross-border data access, use and exchange are integral to economic development in the digital age, wherein every sector, from manufacturing to agriculture to retail, requires a data flow. Global data-based infrastructures like cloud computing emphasize cross-border economic activity, therefore enabling the participation of various smaller entities and start-ups in global markets. Further, an increase in access of information (through cross-border availability of data), proportionately increases efficiency and productivity of markets, accelerating the spread of ideas, research and more <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/TechnologyMediaCommunications/2014_uk_tmt_value_of_connectivity_deloitte_ireland.pdf">samples of information</a>. The importance of global data flow, has been recognized by the European Commission as well, wherein it stated that “data flows and transfers form an integral part of commercial exchanges for new growing digital businesses, such as, social media or cloud computing.” Due to the advent of data driven innovation, it has been <a href="https://marietjeschaake.eu/data-protectionism-the-growing-menace-to-global-business">estimated</a> that cross-border data flow has, in the recent past, contributed 1/3rd to the 10% increase in the Global GDP, and such a significant contribution is likely to rise due to the surge in data flows.

It is observed however that the Indian Government has implemented measures imposing a condition on service suppliers to store data on domestically located servers and localize data processing within the boundaries of their territory. These restrict and prohibit cross border services, and force companies to replicate the data storage infrastructure thereby increasing the compliance and investor cost, as well as creating data security issues. These limitations impede new global services and are an anathema for those advocating the concept of globalization. Next-generation services like Google Glass, Driverless Cars etc., require such an extensive inflow of data without any barriers, and such restrictions on cross border data flow, prevent venture enterprises dealing in such emerging businesses to enter certain markets. This has been <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jboutelle/slideshare-aws-talk">argued</a> to be not only be detrimental for the end consumers and these multinational companies aiming to provide such services, but also for small enterprises in such local jurisdictions, which depend on these global services and their scalability to rise up and advance their competence and market grasp. The value of such exposure is being belittled by policy makers supporting data localization. Even the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/49258588.pdf">OECD</a>) has stated that “nations should avoid barriers to the location, access and use of cross-border data facilities and functions” out of concern about the constraints on data and informational flow and its consequences on global economic development.

<strong>Reasons for Constraining Data Flows and Encouraging Localization</strong>

The major reasons cited by the Government for employing data localization measures and restraining cross-border access to data are privacy, security, a check on foreign surveillance and increased development of local businesses. The security-driven school of thought argues in favor of national security over the importance being given to technological flow and freedom to disseminate information especially in the Post-Snowden era. Specifically, in the wake of the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/91938676/">Puttaswamy</a> judgment and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook">Cambridge Analytica-Facebook</a> incident, there is a rise in the demand of data protection and sovereignty, given the amount and multitude of information shared online and the possible harms of unauthorized disclosure. However, it has been <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/research/internet-security-indias-quest-for-data-localisation/">argued</a> pertinently that the “balkanization of the Internet has larger security implications." A better way to look at it is strengthening privacy laws without impinging upon the transcendental benefits offered by global access of data through the internet.

Another reason for such localization of data is its potential for weaponization through digital platforms increasing the demand for digital sovereignty. Further, the <a href="https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Data_Protection_Committee_Report.pdf">Srikrishna Committee</a> report has cited the example of China and its AI driven growth along with its contribution to the economy and has tried to relate this development to the stringent localization measures followed by China. Other benefits of data localization have been cited in the report referring to (i) increased foreign direct investment in digital infrastructure and (ii) positive spill-over effects of an indigenous market for data centers through job creation and localization of skilled professionals.

<strong>Flaws in the Reasoning of Localization</strong>

Firstly, with respect to the increase in local investment as well as Foreign Direct investment to promote indigenous start-ups in the digital infrastructure, it must be recognized that data localization would require the ISP to employ a physical, local infrastructure in every operative jurisdiction. This is a disincentivizing factor as it heavily increases the financial burden of setup. For the local storage of data, <a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/incentives-and-infrastructure-what-govt-can-do-to-boost-data-centres-in-india/400234/">data centers</a> need to be set up which are expensive and resource intensive. Further, this move fulfills the rich getting richer aphorism, as only larger players like Reliance and PhonePe, or Paytm would be able to afford the same, rather than the smaller players like MobiKwik. It is the consumers who are most likely to bear the brunt of this, by losing access to many services which get discontinued due to the compliance costs involved. Country specific reciprocal measures are another economic consequence of this diplomatic practice, wherein reciprocal barrier to entry for Indian firms seeking to take advantage of globalization could be imposed. Reciprocal protectionism is harmful for not only these businesses but also for the local consumers. Such a measure goes against the economic policies of the current government as well, wherein the main idea is promotion of startups. However, these startups although willing to invest in the Indian Market, might just not have large enough capital to set up a local data storage unit, which deters such investment. The United States has harshly <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/data-localisation-privacy-us-raises-concerns-over-india-s-digital-laws-123529">criticized</a> this move, showing its intention of imposing a reciprocal barrier.

Secondly, questioning the claim of National Security, restricting data within a limited geographical territory rather makes the data more vulnerable to security leaks. Using local measures as an instrument to protect data rather than more specialized global ones brings in weaker authenticity and a loss of a competitive edge on competence. Weaker security measures are more prone to foreign surveillance. Security of data cannot be determined by a single factor of storage, rather it depends on intelligence of security protocols, usage of encryption technology, and IT infrastructure. Also, the localization of data makes it easier for surveiling organizations as it eases the logistical burden of finding and overcoming various levels of security measures. This has been referred to as the “<a href="https://thewire.in/business/regulation-online-pharmacies-india-challenges">Jackpot</a>” problem.

It must be noted that governments on the one hand, argue for localization and constraining data flow and on the other hand routinely themselves share data and intercepted information with one another. Further, security of personal information with the government and on its devices cannot be conclusively argued to be better as it certainly increases the vulnerability of state surveillance and censorship affecting consumer choice as to choosing their own entity to store their data and secure it which they believe would fulfill their needs in the best possible way. It takes the form of an imposition and goes directly against the concept of democracy.

Thirdly, as far as the reasoning of AI development through localization and the premise of China being a technological superpower due to such data localization is concerned, it has been noted that China has a lot of developed companies and is not a developing economy. Further, attributing the Chinese technological boom to data localization is not supported empirically and there are a range of other factors that may have led to China’s success. These need to be evaluated in the context of India’s developmental state to derive a dependable conclusion and comparison.

The solution to digital colonization is stronger security and privacy measures and not protectionism. India needs to invest in strengthening data privacy fundamentally rather than setting up local data storage units which will constrain data flow. Specifically, for the big technology-driven companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google etc, India is a lucrative business avenue and this needs to be realized before repelling such companies from conducting business in India with Indian consumers by increasing compliance costs through local data storage.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With food emerging out as a heavily traded commodity internationally, the majority of the nations around the world have become melting pots of civilization, leading to the increasing interconnectedness of the global food system and complexity of the supply chains. With the long-winded food supply chains there exists information asymmetry between the consumers and the food they consume. This puts consumers at a significant disadvantage with respect to assessing the quality and safety of imported food.

Concomitantly with the expansion of world food trade, the world population has become more vulnerable to the outbreak of diseases caused by tainted food and the risk of exposure to it. Such risks, which have a direct bearing on our health and well-being, could emanate from agents and sources including, <em>inter alia</em>, microbial pathogens, illness-causing bacteria, pesticide residues, food additives, growth hormones, zoonotic diseases, environmental toxins, etc. History is replete with alarming incidents of food-borne illnesses or communicable animal diseases attributed to pathogens or deadly viruses emerging from human contact with live animals. These include: Asian Flu in 1957-58 from a mutation in wild ducks which resulted in no less than 1.1 million dead, H5N1 Bird Flu in 1997 from Chinese geese with at least 455 dead, SARS in 2002-03 from wild animals (perhaps bats, civet cats) with at least 774 dead, and H7N9 Bird Flu in 2013 from poultry at live bird market which resulted in about 610 dead. For this reason, food safety concerns about food imports have far-reaching implications including lowering the demand for certain imported food products, changing the patterns of international food trade and limiting market access.

It bears emphasis that recently the egregious shape of food safety in China has been witnessed world over when the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it">COVID-19</a>) has been, though allegedly, linked to a wet market in Wuhan, China. Resultantly, the world is left helplessly supine. The agri-food sector is faced with the critical global challenge of ensuring the safety of articles of food, whether traded internationally or domestically. Global citizens remain confounded with many questions regarding, <em>inter alia</em>, the safety of the articles of food imported from different parts of the world or whether the food or food packaging may have a probable nexus with the transmission of COVID-19.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has been at the vanguard of food safety. While <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020">declaring</a> COVID-19 a pandemic, it has published precautionary recommendations as well as advice on practicing good hygiene during the handling and preparation of food, such as washing hands, cooking meat and poultry thoroughly and averting possible cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods. In light of the turmoil caused by this unprecedented pandemic, lawmakers and food regulators across the globe are following the footsteps of the WHO. While closely monitoring the evolving COVID-19 outbreak, they have been dispelling the information asymmetry that has been baffling the consumers and the market for food.

In India, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), established under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, constituted a Committee of Experts (CoE) to scrutinize the possibility of presence of coronavirus in imported food articles. The following measures have been initiated by the FSSAI:
<ul>
 	<li>An <a href="https://fssai.gov.in/upload/advisories/2020/03/5e622feb0bd88Letter_Corona_Imported_Food_06_03_2020.pdf">advisory</a> dated March 6, 2020 was issued by the FSSAI stating that the CoE has opined that there is no conclusive evidence of the food-borne transmission of coronavirus in the articles of food imported from countries infested with the virulent pandemic. It has also affirmed that any such article of food is safe for human consumption.</li>
 	<li>A press release accompanied the advisory stating that the predominant route of transmission of COVID-19 is human-to-human. It also clarified that properly cooked poultry and meat products are safe to consume. As a precautionary measure, it advised practicing good hygiene and avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked meat as well as unprocessed food products.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.fssai.gov.in/upload/media/FSSAI_News_Corona_Chef_28_03_2020.pdf">Another advisory</a> dated March 24, 2020 has been published as a guidance for the Chefs and the Food Handlers. It deals with issues in the nature of, <em>inter alia</em>, preparation, pre-preparation, procurement of vegetables and other cooking items, handling currency.</li>
 	<li>A Guidance Note and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">Press Release</a> dated April 15, 2020 regarding <em>Food Hygiene and Safety Guidelines for Food Businesses during Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic</em>  has been released.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1"><span></span></a>

In the wake of the sudden <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html">spike</a> in cases of COVID-19 in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), established by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 1938, released a new <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-during-emergencies/food-safety-and-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19">guidance</a> for the citizen consumers and the food and beverage industry on March 23, 2020. On an earlier occasion, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-supply-chain-update">advised</a> that there is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted through food. It has been advised that the maintenance of food safety should be continued by adherence to social distancing and stringent hygiene practices (i.e., diligently washing hands and surfaces, separating raw meat from other foods, cooking to the right temperature, etc.) when handling or preparing foods. Food Standards Scotland (<a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/consumers/food-safety/coronavirus">FSS</a>) and Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (<a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/safety/Pages/NOVEL-CORONAVIRUS-AND-FOOD-SAFETY.aspx">FSANZ</a>) stand in confirmation with the FSSAI and FDA on the absence of any definitive evidence regarding foodborne transmission of COVID-19. FSS has also issued COVID-19 Guidance for <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/publications-and-research/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-food-business-operators-and-their-employees">food business operators</a> and their employees. The European Food Safety Authority (<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/coronavirus-no-evidence-food-source-or-transmission-route">EFSA</a>) too issued a statement upholding that food is not a probable source or route of transmission of the virus. Some risk management advice has also been issued on March 30, 2020, by the <a href="https://www.bfr.bund.de/en/can_the_new_type_of_coronavirus_be_transmitted_via_food_and_objects_-244090.html">Federal Institute for Risk Assessment</a>, Germany.

Together with other food regulators, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (<a href="https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html">FSAI</a>) has also affirmed that no reported cases of COVID-19 have been linked to the contamination of food. While providing the information on the role of food workers in prevention thereof, the FSAI has explained the significance of proper hand washing procedures. It has also been an endeavor of FSAI to explicate the extra measures that the food businesses may take while managing the transport and delivery of food. The canteens in ‘essential services’ including hospitals, and other frontline facilities, have been advised to observe respiratory etiquette.

The food safety regulators across the globe, thus, proclaim that there’s no evidence of any reported cases of COVID-19 being transmitted through food. However, they also maintain that there’s still a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2020/03/27/coronavirus-can-washing-produce-prevent-covid-19-spread/2901725001/">possibility</a> of COVID-19 being transmitted through food when an infected person sneezes or coughs directly on it. Furthermore, a conspectus of the aforesaid directives and advisories would lead to the conclusion that the world population needs to underscore the importance of consistent and collective action in these troubling and turbulent times. Being fully aligned to ensuring safe and wholesome food for human consumption requires concerted global efforts. Prompt and timely sharing of cross-country information should be espoused to preserve the standards of health, safety and welfare of the global citizens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Co-parenting will get trickier as stay-at-home orders are lifted. During stay at home orders, parents were dealing with uniform instructions about how to act. Co-parenting was still an issue when parents considered how to apply the guidance to their child and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2020/04/julie-colton-child-custody-pandemic/">custody situations</a>. These issues finally started to feel under control for many parents when the next challenge has arisen. As stay-at-home orders are lifted, the directions about social distancing are becoming more uneven. Parents will need to consider the regulations set by government, as well as social issues.

As parents head back to work, they will need to discuss potential childcare arrangements. Will they use the same provider? Will they limit the child’s time at a daycare? Will they allow the non-custodial parent to care for the child instead of a third party babysitter? Is a nanny practicing the same level of social distancing? Parents will need to have open communication about their intended childcare arrangements. They must be ready for these plans to change quickly as more information is learned. It would be helpful for a parent to get as much information from the childcare provider as possible, and then pass that information along to the co-parent. Both parents may need to talk to childcare provider to determine the specifics of how social distancing will occur within the facility itself. If the parents are using separate childcare providers, there may need to be a discussion about information being provided between the parties.

The CDC guidance <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children.html">requires masks for children</a> over the age of two. Masks are not recommended for children under the age of two because of a risk of suffocation. Parents will have to decide when the child will the wear a mask. They will also need determiner what type of mask the child will wear. Will the parents share the child’s masks? Do the used masks need to be returned to the parent who purchased them? Should the parent returning the mask be responsible for laundering the mask?

When social distancing is explained to a child, the idea of the coronavirus can be scary. A child may feel pressure to follow the lead each co-parent during his/her custody time. If one parent is stricter than the other parent, children could be caught in the middle. A child may feel guilty about enjoying a social event with one parent when the other parent does not permit the same level of socialization. On the other hand, a child might feel pressure to socialize even if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Open communication between parents can help prevent children from being caught in the middle of these situations. Parents will need to determine what level of social distancing will be practiced in each home. Will the parents practice the same level of social distancing in their houses? If not, are the parents talking about how the children are handling the differences. While children often handle different sets of rules in different homes well, they may struggle more with different levels of social distancing.

Courts are beginning to reopen. This means the courts may start to be able to address custody disputes. Court responses will likely be delayed as the courts attempt to catch up on the items that were canceled during the court closure. As courts open up many are providing direction to local lawyers. The Court of Common Pleas in <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/Administration/Covid_19Plan.pdf?V=6">Allegheny County</a>, Pennsylvania has issued general emergency procedures for lawyers to follow, as well as area specific for information for <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/family/childrens_court/child_custody/default.aspx">custody</a> cases and <a href="https://www.alleghenycourts.us/downloads/Family/PFA%20Procedures%203.25.20.pdf">domestic violence</a> cases. Co-parents should be prepared for court dates to continue to occur virtually via either phone or video conference.

If you are curious about how your court is handing the pandemic, you should try to locate the court’s website. Many court websites will tell you what types of cases are being heard and when they intend to reopen.

There are a number of different ways to try to resolve custody disputes without court. Parents may want to consider working with a co-parenting counselor to help them navigate discussions about disputes.

Parents may choose mediation to address co-parenting disputes. A number of mediators are begging to offer virtual mediation using video conference programs such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The mediator can conduct the session while continuing to limit their potential exposure. This move toward virtual mediation can be helpful in interstate and international custody matters. Parents may finally be able to find mediators who can assist them despite the geographic distance. This allows the parents to stay comfortable in their own home, while still working to resolve co-parenting issues. Mediators remain neutral. If mediation has stalled, you might want to consider collaborative law.

Collaborative law custody cases are continuing to stay active. In collaborative law, co-parents are continuing to hold virtual meetings with their team. The parents’ attorneys can help to move people past situations that appear impassable. If the collaborative team has a parenting coach, the parenting coach is also a great resource.

Please keep in mind that pandemic has changed everyone’s financial situation. This change can cause some family law disputes. Parents should continue to pay support during this time. If income has changed, the payor should consult with a lawyer about potentially adjusting payments. A support obligor with changed income should also consider consulting with their attorney to see if a support modification is warranted.

If childcare or children’s activities have changed, that might also affect a support arrangement. It might be important to let the other parent know you are having some financial issues. Disclosing this change can help build trust with the other parent. It might also open up communication. While courts may not be hearing these issues right now, some requests can be submitted to the court electronically. Submitting the request electronically might help to reserve a spot in a scheduling queue before the courts reopen. Parents can look into mediation and collaborative law to dress issues more quickly.

Most importantly, co-parents need to communicate openly and keep their children at the center of the conversation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As society grapples to stay on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a heightened responsibility on governments to effectively deal with this public health crisis, in a manner that is least-restrictive towards the civil liberties of its citizens. The use of technology as a part of disaster-response cannot be denied, but the regulatory lacunae in India with regards to the use of such technology mean one must proceed with caution.

Contact-tracing applications have been hailed as a key way to maximize efficient and localized decision making with respect to the spread of COVID-19. Such applications have been adopted in various countries including India, which recently launched its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/indian-government-launches-aarogya-setu-app-to-crack-coronavirus-infections">Aarogya Setu</a> application. There have been many an eyebrow raised that these technological interventions, employed as extraordinary measures in the pandemic, may become permanent fixtures of government intrusion in our lives. The core contention in the use of technology in battling such public crises is the infringement of the privacy of citizens. In a trade-off between battling a public health crisis affecting all, and securing the privacy of a few, the scales tip in favor of the former. However, this is not a zero-sum situation. Even in such emergencies, the government must ensure that privacy is not disproportionately infringed.

In the absence of a comprehensive data protection framework in India, this paper analyses the Aarogya Setu application and its privacy policy on the touchstone of the proportionality principle laid down in the <a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_24-Aug-2017.pdf">Puttaswamy</a> judgement, and through the lens of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (<a href="http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/373_2019_LS_Eng.pdf">PDPB 2019</a>). It highlights how the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service results in a risk of establishing a surveillance framework that may outlast the need of the hour.

<strong>The Proportionality Principle and PDPB 2019</strong>

Due to the lack of a comprehensive data protection legal framework in India, the only authoritative standards are the principles propounded in the Puttaswamy judgement. Nonetheless, this paper relies on the PDPB 2019 to analyse the application through the proposed legal provisions.

In Puttaswamy, the Supreme Court recognized data protection as an essential part of information privacy. It stated that any infringement of such privacy must satisfy three requirements, namely – the existence of a valid law, a legitimate state interest in pursuing that course of action and that the infringement of privacy must be proportionate to the objective sought. Any means of achieving state interest would be considered proportional if it was the least-restrictive means to achieve that goal and did not have a disproportionate impact on the right holder.

The PDPB 2019 comprehensively lays down the rights and duties of the Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries, and Data Processors. It holds the Data Fiduciary accountable for compliance with the Bill, which contains detailed provisions for consent of the Data Principal for data processing, data retention, purpose of collection of data, and transparency in the processing of data. Thus, the Aarogya Setu application can be considered a proportionate infringement of the right to privacy of individuals if it is sanctioned by law as a means of securing a legitimate objective and follows the principles of data protection.

<strong>Aarogya Setu – one too many issues</strong>

Aarogya Setu became the most downloaded <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/india-s-aarogya-setu-becomes-world-s-highest-downloaded-app-in-just-13-days-11586954392024.html">application</a> in the world in the month since its release. Yet, its <a href="https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/tnc/">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> have created a storm among privacy activists for its non-compliance with the most fundamental aspects of proportionality and the data protection principles.

Aarogya Setu collects personal data of the users, which is stored on a government server and remains on the server until 30 days after the user cancels their registration. At the outset, it must be noted that this collection of personal data by the government is not sanctioned by law and is only conducted on an ad-hoc basis. In such unforeseen emergent situations, the Government of India has resorted to the provisions of <a href="https://www.ndmindia.nic.in/images/The Disaster Management Act, 2005.pdf">Disaster Management Act</a>, 2005 to order emergency measures. However, no such order has been issued to supplement the usage of the application to collect personal data. This is problematic because under the PDPB 2019, any data fiduciary must process all personal data in accordance with the law. The absence of such an order gives the government more leeway with how to process personal data of citizens and excludes such data collection from judicial scrutiny.

The problems arising out of the absence of a legal sanction are exacerbated by the fact that the Terms of Service of the application state that the Government will not be liable for any claims in relation to the use of the application of the data collected from it. Not only does this violate the accountability of data fiduciaries in the PDPB 2019, but it disincentivizes the government from complying with the data protection principles by not having to face any adverse consequences.

With regards to pursuing a legitimate state interest, contact-tracing applications have been deployed in various <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/digital-response-outbreak-covid-19">countries</a> to significantly accelerate the rate of individual awareness and testing. However, the suitability of such applications in meeting this interest in India cannot be ascertained with accuracy. The developers of the application have stated themselves that for the application to succeed, at least <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/behind-aarogya-setu-app-push-at-least-50-people-must-download-for-impact-6357121/">50% of India’s population</a> needs to download the application. As <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit">Sidharth Deb</a> notes, with non-smartphone users constituting two-thirds of the Indian population, questions arise as to whether this application is already set up to fail.

As per the proportionality test, any infringement on the privacy of the individuals must be achieved by the least restrictive means. The <a href="https://web.swaraksha.gov.in/ncv19/tnc/">purpose</a> of the application is to notify, trace and suitably support people infected with COVID-19. This vaguely worded provision does not clarify a strict purpose for which one’s data is collected or used. When one downloads the application, they are required to provide personal data such as name, age, gender, profession, travel history and known contacts with COVID-19 patients. The predominant concern in this regard is that the application requires users to provide for more information than is needed for contact tracing. The requirements of ‘gender’ and ‘profession’ have no known correlation to the disease. The government provides no justification for collecting this data, which means that this provision contradicts the principle of data minimization in the PDPB, 2019.

The privacy policy states that the personal data would be stored on government servers in "anonymized, aggregated datasets" to generate reports and heat maps for the management of the COVID-19 crisis. A good <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/protecting-civil-liberties-during-public-health-crisis">model</a> for a contract-tracing application is limited to notifying people that they have been in contact with a positively tested patient. There is a lack of clarity regarding the need to aggregate and anonymize the personal data of countless citizens to serve this purpose. Further, if the data is actually anonymized, this raises questions as to the basis on which it may be aggregated by the government. These aggregated datasets will not be erased from government servers at any point, which conflicts with the data retention provisions.

Aarogya Setu’s source code has not been made available to the general public, despite the government’s prevailing <a href="https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/policy_on_adoption_of_oss.pdf">policy</a> on open source software. This means that the method and standards of encryption followed in the anonymization of the data are unknown. Open source codes enhance transparency and allow for a community audit of the code, leading to greater security. There have already been instances where the application has <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/aarogya-setu-app-exposed-some-user-data-to-youtube-flaw-fixed-now-1671747-2020-04-27">compromised data</a> of users due to a bug in the software. Further, in the absence of the source code and an explicit bar on reverse engineering in the Terms of Service, there is no way to ensure that the data remains anonymized and is not reverse engineered by the government later for other purposes.

Another aspect of the application which fails the proportionality test would be the lack of purpose limitation provisions in the privacy policy. It provides that the information collected by the app using the self-assessment tests and the Bluetooth/GPS tracking, once uploaded to the government server, may also be provided to persons carrying out "necessary medical and administrative interventions" in relation to COVID-19. It also states that the personal information collected may be used to comply with legal requirements. These vague provisions mean that not only could your data be retained for longer than the policy mentions, but also be shared with third parties engaged in the medical or administrative purposes.

Moreover, the application continuously monitors the user’s GPS location and saves it on the device, to be uploaded on the server in case the patient tests positive. This is in contrast with other contact tracing <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">applications</a>, which resort to the use of Bluetooth to develop their contact records. Continuously tracking the movements of the citizens using GPS is a disproportionate infringement of their privacy, because such granular access to one’s location history is effectively surveillance. Such location data can be used to determine many personal details of the user, such as their addresses, without their express consent. Moreover, this information can also be used to enforce compliance with the lockdowns mandated by <a href="https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=200655">Executive Orders</a>, as they would fall under the necessary administrative measures envisaged in the privacy policy. The use of GPS data to enforce lockdowns is far beyond the mandate of a contact-sharing application, violating the principle of purpose limitation in PDPB 2019.

There is no mention in the privacy policy of the application being temporary and to be used only during the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests that the application could be used for other governmental purposes. The Government has altered the Privacy Policy once already, without notifying its users. What’s to stop it from doing it again to include provisions allowing more data grabbing? Aarogya Setu being the starting point for a permanent surveillance framework in the near future is a looming possibility and its Privacy Policy does little to assuage those concerns. Potentially leading to long-term surveillance, the application fails the proportionality test by having a disproportionately negative impact on the citizens’ rights.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

The use of emergency measures must remain in the ambit of emergency situations, else we risk the creation of an Orwellian state. As noble as the intentions of the government may be, Aarogya Setu fails to satisfy the barebones necessity of the prevailing informational privacy framework. The government has already issued orders making the use of the application, in its present form, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/aarogya-setu-now-mandatory-for-employees-in-india-here-s-how-to-register-11588408846545.html">mandatory</a> for employees in India. In times of such public crises, the right to privacy cannot be completely compromised. Governments must find a middle ground to protect its citizens’ rights – both of health and privacy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the coronavirus pandemic continues to increase across the globe, crossing over the four million mark and killing more than 300,000 patients, a parallel pandemic of misinformation and fake news is spreading around, putting lives at risk. Many researchers have termed this so called storm of misinformation a "disinfodemic." There is a growing concern because misinformation during such a pandemic can be dangerous and not only misleading.

<strong>The Need to Curb Fake News</strong>

Disinformation spreads like a wildfire, sparking panic among the public. Unchecked and false information not only causes havoc around the world, but also hampers the collective efforts of frontline workers (medical and police personnel) who are trying to make an impact in fighting the disease.

UNESCO has shown concern over the recent COVID-19 related disinformation by publishing two <a href="https://en.unesco.org/covid19/disinfodemic">policy briefs</a> that assess the COVID-19 disinfodemic of disinformation, fabricated truths, bogus websites, videos and images and studies their impact.

Medical officials engaged in <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/indore-stone-pelting-the-inside-story-of-whatsapp-messages-and-fearmongering-that-led-to-shocking-attack-on-doctors">screening</a> in the Taat Patti Bakhal area in Indore had a close escape when a group of agitated locals of the area started stone pelting, prompting a large number of police personnel to be deployed in the area to gain control over the situation. However, no injury was caused. The incident was sparked when a whatsapp message went viral in the area claiming that the medical officials were injecting healthy Muslims with the virus and urged the people to boycott them. This was just one of the incidents followed by the chain of fake whatsapp messages. Amid the pandemic, security officers engaged in Jammu and Kashmir are facing a major <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/apr/10/amid-pandemic-fake-news-a-challenge-for-forces-in-kashmir-2128275.html">challenge</a> of fake documents which read like any genuine order passed by the administration. The administrative authorities have to continuously deny the fake orders being circulated on social media.

The Supreme Court of India in the recent case of <a href="https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/OM dt.1.4.2020 along with Supreme Court Judgement copy.pdf">Shri Alakh Alok Nath v. Union of India</a> (2020) has expressed its concern over the exodus of migrant workers triggered due to spread of fake news causing panic and confusion. The Court ordered the government to set up a portal to disseminate accurate information regarding coronavirus. This is not the first time when the Supreme Court has recognized the problem of fake news. In 2019 in the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/90111783/">Facebook v. Union of India</a> (2019) bench comprising of Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Aniruddha Bose said that the misuse of social media has reached dangerous proportions and asked the government to devise guidelines to tackle this problem.

The World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/fake-news-what-it-is-and-how-to-spot-it/">recognized</a> the spread of fake news as one of the greatest threats to the hyper connected digital society we live in. There have been instances where such misinformation has provoked violence, distrust, confusion and discord. Hence, this demands an urgent need for fake news to be weeded out from sources of trusted and reliable news and information.

<strong>Steps Taken to Curb Fake News</strong>

Seeing the great amount of disinformation being circulated among the public, the WHO has added a separate "<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters">myth busters</a>" section under the Advice for the Public column that refutes all the myths claiming that spraying or introducing bleach or other disinfectants into the body, drinking ethanol or hot weather or snow etc. will kill the virus. This practice is being followed by the Indian government who is showing a relevant link so that the public has access to true information about coronavirus.

A surge has been seen in false content ranging from treatment with disinfectants to photoshopped government orders warning about emergency, communal content, audio and video clips on social media platforms such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter and TikToks. It has become imperative for them to take necessary actions to curb such misinformation.

Whatsapp in partnership with the government has launched MyGov Corona Helpdesk on the app to provide prompt, reliable and official information on coronavirus. Within two weeks of its launch over <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/whatsapp-chatbot-mygov-corona-helpdesk-sees-over-2-crore-users-821652.html">20,000,000 users</a> were reported. TikTok introduced an enhanced in-app reporting system for its users to report any content which they believe to be deceptive and false by selecting a "misleading information" category within the app. The reported content is then sent to an internal task force and escalated to a third party fact checker. Instagram and Facebook banned ads selling masks and sanitizers claiming to be hundred percent safe against coronavirus to stop people exploiting the health emergency.

Seven companies came together in collaboration to combat the misinformation on their platforms. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Youtube and LinkedIn in a joint statement are said to be working closely in response to the pandemic.

<strong>The Need for Stronger Legal Provisions</strong>

As fake news is crawling all over the internet, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology issued an <a href="https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/advisory_to_curb_false_news-misinformation_on_corona_virus.pdf">advisory</a> to social media platforms to curb misinformation on coronavirus. The advisory was issued after taking into consideration panic fueled by fake news on social media platforms. According to the advisory such social media platforms are intermediaries under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1752240/">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of Information Technology Act and were notified under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/844026/">Section 79</a> of the IT Act to remove any such misinformation and disseminate authentic information related to coronavirus on their platforms.

India does not have any special law to deal with ‘fake news’ and is therefore dealt under the current provisions of the Indian Penal Code of 1860 and the Disaster Management Act of 2005 (DMA). To date only the Maharashtra Government has passed "<a href="https://www.maharashtra.gov.in/Site/Upload/Acts Rules/Marathi/Korona Notification 14 March 2020....pdf">The Maharashtra COVID-19 Regulations</a>, 2020" to deal specifically with coronavirus. It prohibits persons, institutions or organizations from disseminating any information related to coronavirus without ascertaining facts and prior clearance from the relevant health authorities in order to tackle the spread of misinformation.

The provision of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/640589/">Section 54</a> of the Disaster Management Act of 2005 deals with "circulation of false alarm or warning as to the severity or magnitude, leading to panic." It is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year with fine. Section 54 of the DMA deals specifically with the time of disaster. But the ambit and impact of fake news and the need to curb such misinformation is beyond that.

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/360749/">Section 505(1)(b)</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is comparatively extensive and provides a wider canvas to deal with the problem. The section prohibits the publication or circulation of any false content likely to cause "fear or alarm to the public...whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against...public trainquility." Under this the convict can be punished with a maximum imprisonment of six years and a fine. But the proviso states that if the statement is made under good faith or believed to be true, it won’t amount to an offence.

In the current scenario Section 54 of the DMA and Section 505(1)(b) of the IPC can be used to deter many cases. Though the necessity for legal provisions dealing specifically with misinformation becomes more crucial now than ever before.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

While our front line workers are dealing with the first wave of the pandemic by treating those who are infected, the secondary pandemic that is the spread of misinformation has to be dealt with by all, starting with the public. Providing correct information is only half of the steps required. Stopping fake news from spreading among the public is the greater step to be taken. As social media becomes deeply instilled in our day-to-day lives, this calls for a joint effort by both policy makers and technology pioneers to mitigate the adverse impact of this disinfodemic and a careful balance has to be struck between regulations and individual freedoms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just last week, we were saddened by the loss of <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/05/12/aimee-stephens-dies-transgender-us-supreme-court/3118323001/">Aimee Stephens</a> at age 59. Ms. Stephens was a Detroit funeral director who, in 2013, announced a gender transition that exposed her employer’s deep intolerance toward transgender people. For seven years, she challenged the harsh dismissal and loss of livelihood that followed the announcement. Although she will not hear the Supreme Court’s decision in her case, Ms. Stephens’ unwavering commitment to workplace dignity made history in 2018 in her <a href="https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/18a0045p-06.pdf">landmark victory</a> before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in one of the most nuanced examinations of sex discrimination ever issued.

The decision in <em>EEOC v. R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc.</em> is best understood as a doctrinal correction to the current ideological drift in causation theory in discrimination law. Since 1989, a segment of the Court has pursued approaches that needlessly narrow the effectiveness of Title VII through causation analysis and anti-classification.

The law's plain language prohibits discrimination against any individual “because of such individual’s...sex.” An employer generally cannot use an employee’s protected trait — here, her sex — to harm or otherwise disadvantage her. Under a different provision, the causation element of proving discrimination against an employee is a factual question due to other reasons employers may point to as the genuine, non-discriminatory reason for its action against the employee. In other words, it is a separate element from the trait element. Thus, “because of...sex” has been interpreted to encompass not only claims regarding women being passed over for men because they are women, but also contextual subordination that relies upon our sex trait, including gender stereotyping, sexual assault, quid pro quo sexual harassment, and hostile work environment. No less than race or religion, sex is a protected trait from which we infer meaning, and experience harm, based upon variable circumstances of time and place.

Thus, the Sixth Circuit unanimously held that “it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based upon that employee’s status” as a transgender person or lesbian employee “without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee’s sex.” But the panel took the farther step of affirming the non-binary sex spectrum, and stated:
<blockquote>Moreover, discrimination because of a person’s transgender, intersex, or sexually indeterminate status is no less actionable than discrimination because of a person's identification with two religions, an unorthodox religion, or no religion at all. And “religious identity” can be just as fluid, variable, and difficult to define as “gender identity”; after all, both have “a deeply personal, internal genesis that lacks a fixed external referent.”</blockquote>
Ms. Stephen’s 2018 victory for LGBTQIA+ communities -- and all workers -- capped a wave of Title VII and Title IX decisions since 2015 in which four circuits have overruled misguided precedent holding that sex discrimination does not reach anti-trans and anti-gay hostility under a narrow definition of sex. (A fifth signaled it would do the same, if given the chance.) So have a majority of district courts that have reached the issues.

However, buried in the Second Circuit’s en banc opinion in <em>Zarda v. Altitude Express</em> (also pending within the Title VII trio of cases the Court heard with Ms. Stephens’s case) was an outlier within the groundswell of courts seeking to course-correct causation analysis. There, a plurality ventured that a gay man’s status was the “but-for cause” of his dismissal, because if he had been a heterosexual woman married to a man, rather than a gay man, his status was determinative of the outcome. This theory, raised on appeal among other theories, conflates the social trait and causation elements of disparate treatment claims and thus competes with the approach of examining the social context of the sex trait. If misapplied to future sex and other trait discrimination cases, but-for causation could flatten existing sex discrimination analysis at a time when society has made significant strides toward recognizing <a href="https://interactadvocates.org/blog/">intersex</a>, <a href="https://www.intersexrecognition.org/resources">non-binary</a>, and gender-fluid people.

Equality scholars may recognize the embedded anti-classification approach in this “but-for causation” theory. Adopting a formalist, abstract approach, anti-classification is a highly disputed form of analysis that would only prohibit the act of classifying people within one forbidden category over more contextual discrimination analysis. By design, it is binary (i.e., male-versus-female) thinking that would ignore intersectional discussion of race, class, and other factors that bring social context to how our sex and gender are perceived.

While we await the Supreme Court’s decisions in the pending trio of Title VII cases, those of us who, like Aimee, believe in the capacity of human understanding must do our part to expand the conversation also.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Introduction</strong>

On November 11, 2019 The Gambia submitted an <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/178/178-20191111-APP-01-00-EN.pdf">application</a> against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Myanmar had violated its obligations under the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (<a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume 78/volume-78-i-1021-english.pdf">Genocide Convention</a>). The representation made by <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf">The Gambia</a> as a ‘proxy’ and on behalf of the 57 other members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, via the litigation mechanism provided for in the Genocide Convention, is a rather unique circumstance. It is the <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-challenges-for-the-icj-in-the-reliance-on-un-fact-finding-reports-in-the-case-against-myanmar/">first time</a> a non-injured third party has sought to enforce obligations <em>erga omnes partes</em> by utilizing this mechanism under the Convention. While the final judgement on the merits might take years to arrive, The Gambia in order to protect the Rohingyas requested the court to indicate provisional measures. The order on <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf.">provisional measures</a> was passed on January 23, 2020.

This order certainly marks an important moment in the fight for the rights of the Rohingyas. However, there are fears in the international community that Myanmar will not give weight to the order for provisional measures. Moreover, the means for enforcement of these orders remain modest. This article explains - firstly, what provisional measures are, what they do and how they have been used in the past. An analogy between the supervisory mechanism under Article 78 of the Court’s Rules, and the jurisprudence of "Continuing Mandamus" at the municipal level will be drawn. Secondly, in the background of the report due from Myanmar soon, it analyses whether Myanmar is likely to comply with the Court’s judgement, and whether there exist any means to ensure compliance.

<strong>Provisional Measures</strong>

Provisional Measures of protection are the international equivalent of <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199268061.001.0001/acprof-9780199268061">interim injunctions</a> or <a href="https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/24/issue/2/what-does-icj-decision-gambia-v-myanmar-mean#_ednref6">temporary restraining orders</a> against a country. The Court, under <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/statute">Article 41</a> of its Statute, has been granted the powers to "indicate" provisional measures, if the circumstances so require, to preserve the respective rights of either party. These measures are provisional in character and should neither amount to an interim judgement, nor prejudice the decision on merits. Prior to indicating provisional measures, the Court needs to be <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/140/140-20081015-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf">satisfied</a> (Paras 86, 118 and 129 respectively) that (i) it exercises prima facie jurisdiction, (ii) the measures are required to preserve the rights of the parties which are the subject of judicial proceedings, from irreparable harm and (iii) there exists urgent necessity to prevent irreparable prejudice to such rights. Expeditiousness for such urgent requests has been institutionally embedded, through Article 74(1) of the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/en/rules.">Rules of the Court</a>, which provides that a request for provisional measures shall take priority over all other cases. The binding effect of these interim measures was confirmed by the Court in its <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/104/104-20010627-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf.">LaGrand Judgement</a> (Para 104) of 2001.

In the period between 1946 and 2011, provisional measures were requested in 31 cases before the court, of which they were granted in 16 cases, rejected in 14 others, and the request was withdrawn in 1 case. The Court pursuant to Articles 75(1) and (2) of the Rules of the Court, has the power to indicate provisional measures <em>proprio motu</em>, including measures other than those requested by one or more of the parties, if necessary. The <a href="https://www.zaoerv.de/62_2002/62_2002_1_a_55_60.pdf">formulation</a> of these orders have usually aimed at preventing aggravation or extension of the dispute, as in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case (1951), the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (1972), the Nuclear Test Case (1973), and the Genocide Convention Case (1993).

In its order of January 23, 2020, the ICJ determined that (i) it has prima facie jurisdiction under Article IX of the Genocide Convention to deal with the case, (ii) The Gambia does have prima facie standing to submit before the Court, (iii) there exists a link between the rights claimed and some of the provisional measures requested, and (iv) there is a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked by The Gambia. Accordingly, the court indicated four of the six provisional measures requested by The Gambia, ordering Myanmar to (i) duly comply with its obligations under the Genocide Convention, (ii) prevent the commission of genocidal acts by either its military, or irregular armed units or organizations under its control, direction or influence, (iii) prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence of wrongdoing under the Genocide Convention, and notably, invoking Article 78 of its Rules (iv) submit a report within four months, on the measures undertaken to give effect to the order, and thereafter every six months until a final decision is rendered.

The ICJ, under Article 78 of the Rules of the Court has the power to request information from the parties on any matter concerned with the implementation of the provisional measures it has indicated. The Court has kept issues covered by its order under continuous review in the <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0922156510000221">Nicaragua Case</a>, and has even ordered parties to inform the Court as to their compliance with the indicated provisional measures in Georgia v. Russia. This power appears to relate to the court’s <em>proprio motu</em> powers to adapt interim measures as per changing circumstances. Both continuous review and requesting information enable the Court to supervise compliance with its provisional measures. This supervisory mechanism appears to be similar to the remedial jurisprudence of "<a href="http://nujslawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Continuing-Mandamus-Mihika-Bhavya.pdf.">Continuing Mandamus</a>" at the domestic level. This is an adjudication mechanism, which enables the domestic court to "ensure and supervise" the implementation of its orders, by monitoring compliance through status reports by relevant executive bodies. The difference however, lies in consequences of non-compliance.

<strong>Compliance</strong>

While the international community has celebrated this order as a landmark in the protection of the human rights of Rohingyas, it seems to be neglecting the forthcoming difficulties which may arise in compliance with this order. Until the submission of the status report due on May 23, 2020, the question of compliance with the provisional measures by Myanmar remains a mystery. These doubts are in no small part fueled by the <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=614013119120120082020083100101112092105043009037074058009066024100110095092098029030019063049055116046060085030068020078121093061033035058053093007121114114127101006031041049125087003080101029119079069100088082091077096073074004093075127097030106021114&amp;EXT=pdf">dismal history</a> of compliance by states with provisional measures ordered by the ICJ. Serbia and Uganda serve as the primary bad examples, where states failed to comply with the provisional measures as ordered by the ICJ, and faced limited consequences. Further, the stance of the ICJ on non-compliance acts as a lack of incentive to comply with the measures. The ICJ has <a href="https://u-pad.unimc.it/handle/11393/238626">not yet taken</a> <em>proprio motu</em> action on non-compliance, and relies on the other state party to raise such claims for additional measures. Arguably, non-compliance can also be referred to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). However, action is notoriously dependent on the realpolitik of its permanent members and internal deadlocks within the council. As in the present case, Myanmar’s long term ally, <a href="https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/ssg-report-chinas-role-in-myanmars-internal-conflicts.pdf">China</a>, alongside Russia has previously threatened the UNSC with a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/united-nations-failed-save-rohingya-190628024749391.html">veto</a> against any resolution referring to the Rohingyas brought up there.

Additionally, the international community seems to have forgotten the on-the-ground realities of Myanmar. For years, the country has been under military dominance, with several ethnic military groups <a href="https://theconversation.com/rohingya-genocide-case-why-it-will-be-hard-for-myanmar-to-comply-with-icjs-orders-129170">engaging</a> in internal armed conflict across the seven regions of the country. The presence of Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s State Counselor, at the ICJ appeared to recognize the legitimacy of the ICJ in the eyes of the Myanmar government. Nonetheless, Suu Kyi has herself <a href="https://www.mmtimes.com/news/myanmar-needs-time-deliver-justice-rakhine-war-crimes-state-counsellor.html">denounced</a> the pressure by the international court on Myanmar, and has pressed the need for time for Myanmar to deliver justice by its own military justice system. Further, the Minister for Security and Border Affairs of the Rakhine State was <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmar-minister-says-country-will-not-destroy-evidence-01292020165006.html">reported</a> as stating that the Central Government has not issued any separate orders to take action on the ICJ’s order, and the order on preservation of evidence is “totally unnecessary." Members of the ruling National League for Democracy have taken a similar position, and <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmar-icj-nld-reaction-01242020161650.html">stated</a> that the ICJ’s ruling favors the biased report of the U.N.’s <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G19/236/74/PDF/G1923674.pdf?OpenElement">Independent International Fact-Finding Mission</a> (FFM) on Myanmar (which found signs of genocidal intent, and provided critical evidence of grave violations of international law), while ignoring evidence presented by the Myanmar Government. Human rights workers and attorneys, while demanding pro-active measures, have also <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/myanmar-minister-says-country-will-not-destroy-evidence-01292020165006.html">expressed reservations</a> as to Myanmar’s action on the orders. Therefore, expecting compliance with ICJ’s ruling may be in utter disregard of the on-the-ground situation in Myanmar.

Interestingly, the <a href="https://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/?q=briefing-room/news/2020/01/21/id-9838">Independent Commission of Enquiry</a> (ICOE) ordered by Myanmar delivered its report shortly before the order on provisional measures. It <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/22/myanmar-government-rohingya-report-falls-short">stated</a> that while crimes against humanity have been committed, there is no evidence of any genocidal intent in the attacks in the Rakhine State against the Rohingyas. In a <a href="https://www.moi.gov.mm/moi:eng/?q=announcement/23/01/2020/id-20583">press release</a> soon after the order, the Myanmar government has highlighted the findings of the ICOE and has blamed “human rights actors” for presenting a distorted image of the situation in Rakhine. At no point in the press release does the government indicate its willingness to comply with the order. It merely states that it has taken note of the order. Although the political leadership of Myanmar has reaffirmed that it does not need to change anything as it has not committed genocide, <a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20200125062902-9ittm/">military strikes</a> against Rohingyas have continued even after ICJ’s order. These incidents do not inspire confidence that Myanmar will effectively comply with the interim measures. Moreover, considering the extremely high threshold for proving genocide set in the Bosnian and Croatian Genocide Cases, it is unlikely that the Court will be able to find <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/icj-indicates-provisional-measures-in-the-myanmar-genocide-case/">sufficient evidence</a> of genocidal intent by Myanmar, when the case reaches the merits stage.

Regardless of the success of the legal challenge, an indication of provisional measures by an international public judicial forum such as the ICJ, can exert a potentially calming effect on international disputes. By reminding states of their human rights and humanitarian law obligations, the court renders constructive contribution to the maintenance of international peace, security and rule of law, albeit within its limited judicial role. Accordingly, although it appears unlikely that Myanmar will comply substantively with the Court’s order, the lives of Rohingyas may improve immeasurably, and the perpetrators of wrongdoings could face individual criminal accountability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, French lawmakers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/13/technology/13reuters-france-tech-regulation.html">passed</a> a bill to regulate online hate speech in the country. The law seeks to impose a <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/europe/french-parliament-adopts-controversial-online-hate-speech-bill-1.1589388031976">strict obligation</a> on online platforms to remove offensive content, like hate speech, violence, or racism, within twenty-four hours or risk getting fined and blocked. The over-zealous attempt to regulate the content available across online platforms comes with its own set of drawbacks that result in the cure being more problematic than the disease.

<strong>Tearing the Fabric of "Freedom of Speech" </strong>

The foremost concern that arises from a law imposing a strict deadline to regulate online content is: what will be its implications on the freedom of expression? Categorizing content based on its impact in propagating hate speech involves an analysis of data to determine the context in which such material got uploaded.

In comparison to the US jurisdiction, France authorizes freedom of speech subject to legislative limitations. <a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/sites/default/files/as/root/bank_mm/anglais/cst2.pdf">Article 10</a> of the Declaration of Human and Civic Rights states that “No one may be disturbed on account of his opinions, even religious ones, as long as the manifestation of such opinions does not interfere with the established Law and Order.” In addition to Article 10, Article 11 further states that:
<blockquote>“The free communication of ideas and of opinions is one of the most precious rights of man. Any citizen may therefore speak, write and publish freely, except what is tantamount to the abuse of this liberty in the cases determined by Law.”</blockquote>
France is also subject to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protects the right to freedom of speech, but also acknowledges the state’s power to limit it.

What is to be noted is the extent to which limitations can be imposed on such free speech. In a 2013 case, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the conviction of a protester under a piece of French legislation for insulting the President of France was contrary to the provisions of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In the case of <a href="http://www.humanrights.is/static/files/Itarefni/torgeir_torgeirson_gegn_islandi.pdf">Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland</a>, the ECHR ruled that the imposition of a fine following the publication in a daily newspaper of incidents of police brutality was not proportionate to the legitimate aim of "protecting the reputation of others." The court went on to hold this violated Article 10. Further, in the case of <a href="https://www.hr-dp.org/contents/550">Jersild v. Denmark</a>, the ECHR found that convicting a journalist for granting an interview to certain individuals, which led to the dissemination of certain racist remarks, violated Article 10. The court stated that:
<blockquote>“The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so”.</blockquote>
It can be very well noted, from the above case laws, that the ECHR maintains a high-regard towards the protection of the freedom of speech especially through journalism and, therefore, has come down strictly on countries violating it.

The recently passed French bill imposes a 24-hour strict window and provides for varying impact on online platforms, as one can notice varying levels of ability to deal with such context-specific content among the platform operators. Companies considered to be Internet giants have various AI-based algorithmic technologies and employing specialized staff to identify and curb abuses across the online space. However, it is pertinent to mention that such usage of <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3316562/artificial-intelligence-driven-content-moderation-can-never-be-perfect.html">automated moderation tools</a>, such as AI-based technology, runs the risk of identifying false negatives and false positives. But then that would result in putting a heavy onus on the platform operators to constitute the legality and the illegality of the content based upon certain basic parameters provided by the law. What comes to be of more significance is the burden imposed by such a strict deadline on platforms sans the resources of the giants. A quicker path for such small-time online platforms would be to base the act of content removal entirely on their Terms of Service. <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/side-stepping-rights-regulating-speech-by-contract/">Terms of Service</a> as a mode to regulate content puts the entire onus on the conscience of the platform operators to deem what is to be acceptable and what is not.

It is to be particularly noted that the courts have on occasion, had to deal with the idea of what does and what does not constitute "hate speech." In the case of <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/gunduz-v-turkey/">Gündüz v. Turkey</a>, a sect leader was convicted of propagating hate speech on the basis of his discrediting a particular practice and his defense Sharia Law. The ECHR held that the defending of the practice of Sharia, without calling for action to violate the peace of the country could not be stated to be a violation of Article 10 under the head of "hate speech." In <em>Birol v. Turkey</em>, the ECHR held that the making of fascist remarks to insult the Minister of Justice did not amount to any form of incitement of violence and therefore did not amount to "hate speech."

The above laws signify how time and again the courts had to intervene to disseminate as to what would and what would not constitute hate speech. In France, by dangling the threat to fine 4% of their global revenue, the bill pushes the online platforms to over-remove contents on the limited understanding of what constitutes hate speech. Contents that are supposed to be perfectly legal would end up getting pushed to oblivion citing illegal content. If the removal process leads to certain materials remaining available over the online platform, it would result in the severe wrath of the French Government. This exercise would, therefore, result in a fundamental breach of the idea of "freedom of speech" and would be fatal to the existence of a vibrant democracy.

<strong>Violating the EU E-Commerce Directive</strong>

Enforcing a bill to impose the burden of proof on the platform operators runs the risk of violating Article 14 and Article 15 of the EU E-Commerce Directive. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031&amp;from=EN">Article 14</a> of the EU-E-Commerce Directive puts an obligation on the Member States to ensure that no service provider is held liable for the information stored. The Directive protects a service provider who does not know of the existence of the illegal information and if, on knowledge of the presence of such information, it acts expeditiously to ensure its removal. Imposing a strict fine on platform operators who fail to remove content, deemed to be illegal by the French authorities, runs in contravention to the ideals enumerated by the Directive. In ensuring full compliance, the French authorities failed to take into account the distinct capabilities across a vast plethora of online service providers. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031&amp;from=EN">Article 15</a> of the EU E-Commerce Directive states that:
<blockquote>“Member States shall not impose a general obligation on providers, when providing the services covered by Articles 12, 13 and 14, to monitor the information which they transmit or store, nor a general obligation actively to seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity.”</blockquote>
It can be easily deciphered that the very objective of the French bill leads to a direct violation of Article 15. Through Article 15, the EU sought to protect the service providers from being subject to onerous obligations at the hands of the member states to ensure the content on their platforms.

<strong>Risk of Litigation</strong>

Such online platform operators or service providers now face a double-edged sword. On one hand, the operators face the risk of fines and further sanctions if they are not able to comply with the guidelines imposed by the authorities. On the other hand, in the race to comply with the guidelines, the platform operators face the risk of facing litigation based on violations of freedom of speech and expression. As discussed above, the exercise of content moderation is highly context-based and continuously runs the risk of over-moderation and over-removal. Any method adopted towards regulating hate speech will not always deliver a perfect result and will run the risk of removing legal content off the internet. Such regulatory activities, which put a high onus on the platform operators, make them liable to "right" based litigation and court fines. Thus, putting a hefty dent on the business model of such online enterprises.

<strong>The Scope of an Alternative</strong>

<strong>Following the "Facebook Mission" Report Model</strong>

In May 2019, a team of experts <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/uploads/Regulation-of-social-networks_Mission-report_ENG.pdf">submitted</a> a high-level report on the regulation of social networks to curb online hate speech. The report promoted an accountability-based model to impose a legal obligation on social networks. The report claimed that social networks were best placed to assume the moderation task of online content. Such a moderation task carried out by the social networks will be based on a transparent model that will highlight the terms of usage, the mechanisms adopted, and the dissemination method applied.

The report, as mentioned, provided for a transparent moderation procedure, which was coupled with the tag of accountability. The method calls for content moderation at regular intervals and in a timely instead of imposing a strict deadline to categorize the data available over such networks better. A moderated approach to handling online content would do a great deal in ensuring that the legal content is not taken down under the garb of containing hate speech.

<strong>The "Unbundling" procedure.</strong>

The "unbundling" procedure requires that the online platform operators would open up unregulated versions of the service or the platforms operated by them. This would ensure that the content or the service uploaded by the competitors gets screened through differential ranking and content policies at the instance of the competitors. This process shifts the burden to regulate the content on the platform from that of the platform operator to the respective competitors in the market. Additionally, the procedure promotes users to choose content based on their choice and get protected from contents that might have an adverse effect on their lifestyle.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in an epidemic of hostility with <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/12/covid-19-fueling-anti-asian-racism-and-xenophobia-worldwide">reports</a> of rising hate speech instances coming from across the globe. But curbing a crisis cannot come at the expense of fueling another one. Countries like France, <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/12/13/ethiopia-stop-hate-speech-not-free-speech/">Ethiopia</a>, and <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-bill-aims-at-punishing-hate-speech-with-death/a-51419750">Nigeria</a>, among many others, need to be careful in their noble efforts to curb hostility amongst the humankind. For, the betterment of society can never come by sacrificing "freedom of speech."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A short while ago a draft was being kept in the public domain for review by the Indian Government. The government came up with the Environment Impact Assessment (<a href="http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Draft_EIA_2020.pdf">EIA</a>) Draft, 2020 released by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change. The EIA Notification in India was brought in 1994 and a <a href="http://www.environmentwb.gov.in/pdf/EIA Notification, 2006.pdf">sea change</a> took place in 2006. The purpose of EIA Notification from the very beginning is to ascertain the likely consequences of projects on the environment. However good our intentions may be, it is ultimately laws that effectuate our environmental policies and hence we need proper, comprehensive and sustainable policies in place.

The government is making the assessment process more transparent through the implementation of an online system and further delegation and standardization of the process through amendments. The government claims that amendments are done so as to seek early redressal of problems rather than leaving them unchecked and tangled, however, in view of environmentalists and researchers this draft is legitimizing the violators and thus giving clearances without a proper assessment. This draft is completely contradictory to the environmental protection principles.

The preparation of the report included various criteria like fauna, flora, aspect of ecosystem – which needs to have a base line for three seasons – summer, winter and monsoon, but this new draft allows only one season other than monsoon to be in place. The situation becomes problematic for areas with great diversity such as the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats which are so contradictory in their own nature that naturally how you see Western Ghats in summer is very different from how you see it in monsoon and winter. Many environmental aspects also play a specific role in each season. There are many ecosystems that thrive only during a particular season. Therefore restricting this category to just one season will not be environmentally sustainable.

Earlier there had been stances where construction, expansion, excavation or installation work had started without the Prior <a href="http://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Draft_EIA_2020.pdf">Environment Clearance</a> (EC) or Prior Environment Permission (EP). The draft stressed these issues. If the guidelines of the appraisal committee are defied, then 1.5 times the ecological damaged assessed and economic benefit derived due to the infringement will be charged if the violator reports the violation itself whereas twice that will be levied if the violation is found by the government.

The chief issue which is a matter of discussion among environmentalists and researchers is regarding public consultation in approving environment clearance. Public consultation has always been an important component while ascertaining any design for a project and its impact on the environment because local affected people have a stake in the environment as well. However, in the latest draft the list of the projects which don’t need to seek public consultation has been lengthened. The draft has expanded the list of projects which need no public consultation to include those related to irrigation, construction and area development, expansion and widening of highways, and off-shore mining. One of the clauses in the draft says:
<blockquote>"All projects concerning national defense and security or involving other strategic considerations, as determined by the central government, shall require prior-environment clearance, from the ministry without any change in the category of the project but no information relating to such projects shall be placed in the public domain.”</blockquote>
Now under this clause the government will dilate the ambit of its discretionary powers. The projects concerning defense and security expected from public consultation are comprehensible but the adjoining term “strategic projects” seems quite ambiguous, as now government can designate any project under this term as to restrict public interference. Another disputable point is that government had defined border area as “area falling within 100 kilometres aerial distance from actual control with bordering countries of India” and thus has left a lot to its own discretion. These amendments seem to be done to exempt projects from close scrutiny.

Previously, a developer was supposed to summit a compliance report of the project every 6 months, but now that has been increased to a year. This is problematic as certain environmental consequences on vulnerable communities may go unnoticed if only one report is to be submitted. In fact, this only dilutes the reporting that requires extreme consistency. The period for the environmental approval for mining projects has also been increased for a period up to 50 years from 30 years previously. This 2020 EIA Notification claims to be an instrument for transparency and enabling public participation in environmental democracy and at the same time, the previous time period for conducting hearing for stakeholders in the environmental aspects of the project is being reduced to 40 days from the previous 45 days.

Industrialists, for quite a long time, have been arguing to give <em>ex post facto</em> Environmental Clearances for projects and stating that those found violating environmental regulations should be fined. The government too had bought this <em>ex post facto</em> environment clearance in its EIA notification 2006 which today is in existence, however this amendment was struck down by the National Green Tribunal and stayed by the <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/125429323/">Madras High Court</a>. And recently in the beginning of this month the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/2562/2562_2016_0_1501_21582_Judgement_01-Apr-2020.pdf">Ambelic Pharmaceuticals v. Rohit Prajapati and others</a> with the bench comprising of Justice D. Y. Chandrachud and Justice Ajay Rastogi had passed a judgement saying “Ex Post Facto Environment Clearance is unsustainable in law." Because naturally one cannot ascertain what the likely consequences are after the damage is already done and the projects proponents also have been proactively concealing violations. Nevertheless, the government has been pertinent in introducing <em>ex post facto</em> environment clearance so as to exempt them from the ruling. They have given relaxations in this new draft. The leveling of land now can be carried out without an EC. This practice of leveling of land alters the soil surface which could create havoc in the hilly areas or tropical terrain areas where entire ecosystem depends on runoff water in monsoon season. It may lead to water stagnation or complete alteration of the ecosystem. However, this draft could be seen as an advancement of inland waterways across the country. For the inland waterways dredging is done which requires environment clearance as per the existing rules. However in the EIA 2020 draft, the rivers are kept out of the purview of environment clearance procedure and thus development of inland waterways might get easier.

In conclusion, it wasn’t expected that the government would be putting aside the primary goal of environmental protection to achieve their alternative goal of focusing on the ease of business,. Here the government seems entirely trusting of the industries whose track record isn’t good enough to be taken into confidence. However the ministry has given time period of 60 days to the general public to provide response, but the country has been in lockdown since March and hence we believe that this period must exclude the lockdown period as not everyone is in a position to respond to such a detailed notification.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the beginnings of his crudely acrimonious presidency, Donald Trump has actively undermined US foreign policy relationships. On urgently key matters of world politics and international law, Mr. Trump's typically invalid conclusions have generally been drawn from narrowly belligerent premises. Truly, the main problem with such faulty presidential arguments, however, has not been Trump's gratuitously corrosive premises <em>per se</em>, but rather their implications for national security and world legal order.

Uniformly, these implications have been egregious and baneful.

There is more. On matters that reveal expressly military content, this president's determined violations of logic must also be characterized as counter-productive, harmful and negatively "<a style="cursor: help" title="I have used this concept regularly in certain of my related writings at Israel Defense (Tel Aviv); The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Modern War Institute (West Point); Small Wars Journal (USMC); and The War Room (US Army War College, Pentagon).">force-multiplying</a>."

In the case of Donald Trump's multiple policy <em>synergies</em>, the "whole" policy consequence of this president's cumulative reasoning process exceeds the sum of its various "parts." Looking back at the entire history of the United States, there has never been such a wittingly defective and determinedly injurious president. Now, at a particularly fragile moment when all the "normal" hazards of "<a style="cursor: help" title="Reference here is to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which first created and codified our 'balance of power' system of international law. See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.">Westphalian</a>" geopolitics have not been diminished, this president's current liabilities are being accelerated by yet another level of existential challenge. This is the wholly unpredictable challenge of <em>disease pandemic</em>.

When one takes into account <em>both</em> the manifold derelictions of Trump's conceptual and legal misunderstandings concerning
<a style="cursor: help" title="Under international law, the question of whether a 'state of war' exists between states is ambiguous. Traditionally, a declaration of war was needed before a state of war could exist. Hugo Grotius divided wars into declared wars, which were legal, and undeclared wars, which were not. By the twentieth century, the position that war starts only after a declaration of war by a party was codified by Hague Convention III. It stipulated that hostilities must never begin without a 'previous and explicit warning' in a declaration of war or ultimatum. Currently, declarations of war may be tantamount to international criminality, because of the express criminalization of aggression by authoritative international law, and it could represent a clear jurisprudential absurdity to tie a state of war to formal and prior declarations of belligerency. It follows that war may now exist without formal declarations, but only if there is an armed conflict between two or more states, and/or one of these considers itself 'at war.'">war</a>, terrorism and genocide and the visibly expanding hazards of COVID-19, only one conclusion can make any sense. In essence, it is this: <em>We Americans currently face a "perfect storm" of catastrophic decline and potential collapse</em>. Still, at any willfully ignorant presidential command, our collective difficulties could worsen further. Indeed, at this once unimaginable point of chaotic uncertainty, there has even been high-level and official talk of Trump cancelling the November election as an allegedly precautionary measure.

From the mutually reinforcing standpoints of national and international law, any such cancellation would have immediate and very far-reaching consequences.

For most legal observers, any such cancellation contingency may still seem inconceivable - even amid continuing bad news about the pandemic's spread and lethality - but delaying or canceling the next election would be consistent with various other law-violating aspects of the Trump presidency. Whether we look to the incessant presidential cronyism or instead to Trump's calculably flagrant unconcern for peremptory human rights <em>anywhere</em> on earth, there is no good reason to believe that even core expectations of the US Constitution will always be held sacred at the Trump White House.

Trump believes, mistakenly, that anarchic world politics and Westphalian international law are here to stay, <em>forever</em>, and, still more ominously, that these patterns <em>deserve</em> to endure. In consequence, he offers no plausible hopes for any American leadership that is willing to transform or moderate our rapidly disintegrating world legal system, a conflict-based system of "<a style="cursor: help" title="Says French Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in The Phenomenon of Man: 'The egocentric ideal of a future reserved for those who have managed to attain egoistically the extremity of 'everyone for himself' is false and against nature.'">everyone for himself</a>." This suggests, among other things, that the darkly injurious consequences of Trump's deformed and law-violating foreign policies are rapidly becoming intolerable. Moreover, these fearful consequences point toward something incrementally far worse than "mere" anarchy or "Westphalian" law.

Now they point directly to national and worldwide <em>chaos</em>.

What happens next, in both law and practice?

In principle, at least, even during an American era that openly loathes both intellect and learning (think, for example, of Trump's brazen substitution of his own purported scientific/medical authority on controlling pandemics for that of distinguished epidemiologist Dr. Anthony Fauci), we should begin by "looking back" at expressions of <em>authentic</em> political thought. Accordingly, in his seventeenth century work of classical philosophy, <a style="cursor: help" title="Hobbes work was well familiar to many of the Founding Fathers of the United States, especially Thomas Jefferson.">Thomas Hobbes</a>
- a little-read but foundational author of the eighteenth century <a href="https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2019/09/louis-beres-from-chaos/">American Republic</a> - explored deductively "the natural condition of mankind." Published just a few years after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia created the modern state system, Hobbes' <em>Leviathan</em> placed primary emphasis on <em>geo-strategic</em> and <em><a style="cursor: help" title="Writing about law in the 'state of nature' in Chapter XIII of Leviathan, Hobbes comments famously: 'Where there is no common Power, there is no Law.'">legal</a></em> context.

More precisely, this key thinker's analytic focus was directed toward assorted crucial connections between individual or personal weaknesses and world system <em>anarchy</em> or <em>chaos</em>.

Among Hobbes' principal conclusions was the following: <em>In the "Westphalian" legal system of multiple and independent states, a condition of permanent war obtains, not just where there exists "actual fighting," but also at any time where there should still remain "a <a style="cursor: help" title="Much later, in the twentieth century, German philosopher Karl Jaspers (Man in the Modern Age, 1931) interpreted these dynamics as 'an unceasing maelstrom of reciprocal deception and self-deception by ideologies.'">known disposition</a> thereto."</em> And Hobbes was not even taking into account the rare but plausibly catastrophic factor of a worldwide disease pandemic.

Still, one needn't be a historian, political scientist or legal scholar to understand that such a relentlessly insidious disposition to conflict remains fully current in 2020. At the present historical moment - especially in consideration of the increasingly verifiable evidence for ongoing nuclear proliferation - we are devolving ever further from traditional <em>anarchy</em> and toward a more stubbornly remorseless and hard to fathom <em>chaos</em>. It follows, for scholars and relevant policy makers, that to better understand America's changing strategic posture amid constantly dissembling presidential transformations, substantially more attention must now be oriented to understanding <em>world system dynamics</em> and <em>pertinent international law</em>.

This imperative is all the more compelling because of the already-staggering impact of the Covid-19 worldwide disease <a style="cursor: help" title="Says Albert Camus: 'At the beginning of the pestilence and when it ends, there’s always a propensity for rhetoric...It is only in the thick of a calamity that one gets hardened to the truth, to silence.' ( The Plague).">pandemic</a>.

But what does all this really mean or signify? In brief, it suggests a more consciously <em>contextualized</em> focus on armaments, alignments, power balances and delineated "<a style="cursor: help" title="This focus reflects that every state's first responsibility is to assure national security, and that citizen allegiance is only contingent upon such valid assurances. Most famously, in pertinent political and legal theory, is the statement of Thomas Hobbes at Chapter XXI of Leviathan: 'The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last so long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them.'">orders of battle</a>." Among other things, this suggestion must include a greatly heightened willingness to analyze and examine these listed factors not just as singular or isolated variables of differential importance, but also in various plausible intersections or <em>synergies</em> with each other. By definition, every theory represents a simplification, but this fact ought never be taken as a general license for policy-centered theoreticians to overlook relevant analytic and/or legal complexities.

In its broadest contours, the basic American security dilemma is not complicated. By easy extrapolation, after all, anarchy could soon take on unmanageable and catastrophic forms. At that stage, anarchy could seem benign, or simply be taken as an oddly positive or nostalgic reminder of once seemingly-better days. At that grievously ironic point, of course, "mere" Westphalian anarchy would have been supplanted by chaos, and world law could discover its operational anchor elsewhere.

What then? What would happen to already-decentralized world legal arrangements in a time of chaos? Though hardly compensatory, there would then present an optimal occasion for seeking greater precision in absolutely all corresponding analyses. American strategic thinkers must already understand that certain refractory threats still lying ominously ahead may originate less conspicuously with formidable enemy armies than with multiple forms of decisional miscalculation or inadvertence - threats now being magnified or "force-multiplied" by a many-sided pandemic.

An even more primary axis of conflict in world politics will now require closer conceptual attention by American strategic thinkers and planners. Recalling Thomas Hobbes' definition of war not merely as "actual fighting," but as a "known disposition thereto," US President Donald Trump or his successor should take more explicit note that we already coexist well within certain constraints of "<a style="cursor: help" title="In essence, hypothesizing the emergence of 'Cold War II' means expecting that the world legal system is becoming increasingly bipolar. For early writings, by this author, on the global security implications of any such expanding bipolarity, see: Louis René Beres, 'Bipolarity, Multipolarity, and the Reliability of Alliance Commitments,' Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 25, No.4., December 1972, pp. 702-710; Louis René Beres, 'Bipolarity, Multipolarity, and the Tragedy of the Commons,' Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 26, No.4., December 1973, pp, 649-658; and Louis René Beres, 'Guerillas, Terrorists, and Polarity: New Structural Models of World Politics,' Western Political Quarterly, Vol. 27, No.4., December 1974, pp. 624-636.">Cold War II</a>." This expanding adversarial posture between Russia and the United States is both similar and dissimilar to the original <a style="cursor: help" title="The sole U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control agreement still in force is the New START treaty, signed in 2010 by then-presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev. That Treaty limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance. Russia has offered to extend the New START that expires in February 2021, while the Trump administration has pushed for a new arms control pact that would also include China. In turn, Moscow has described that idea as infeasible, underscoring Beijing’s refusal to negotiate any deal that would reduce its own nuclear arsenal.">Cold War</a>. It defines, <em>inter alia</em>, the most basic context within which all US nuclear strategy must from now on be fashioned or nuanced. Significantly, even this "most basic context" will be impacted by myriad hazards of worldwide disease epidemic, primarily by their largely unpredictable effect upon national decision makers and by their similarly unknowable effects upon Great Power decisional <em>synergies</em>.

In a world increasingly prone to periodic and primal conflict, the role of nuclear weapons will need to be much more closely and <a style="cursor: help" title="For such consideration, see also the author's earlier books, e.g., Louis René Beres: The Management of World Power: A Theoretical Analysis; Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics; Reason and Realpolitik: US Foreign Policy and World Order; Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy; Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy; and Israel's Nuclear Strategy and US National Security (Tel Aviv), a 2016 monograph co-authored by Professor Beres and General (USA/ret.) Barry McCaffrey.">specifically considered</a>. This overriding moral and legal obligation pertains not only to the nuclear capacities and intentions of the United States and its most obvious foes, but also to their several and most probable intersections with other countries.

Again, such plausible intersections could sometimes become "synergistic." In their inherently bewildering task, therefore, American strategists would need to best ensure that (1) there were no further spread of nuclear weapons among recognizable state or <a style="cursor: help" title="This category must also include variously possible state-sub state 'hybrids.' An example might be a future Iran-Hezbollah nexus where nuclear dangers are not posed to America's land or populations directly, but rather to US ally Israel - itself an already nuclear power.">sub-state enemies</a>, and (2) attempting to counter any one designable enemy would not wittingly or unwittingly assist another. Even more potentially bewildering in these pandemic-focused times, these strategists would need to take meticulously proper account of <em>expanding disease impact</em> upon enemy decision-makers and on our own leaders.

This will not be a task for thinly-educated, narrowly political or commerce-oriented personalities.

Soon, too, American decision-makers will need to more fully acknowledge that geo-strategic context can be broadly intellectual rather than just narrowly geopolitical or geographic. Or as expressed in terms of Thomas Hobbes' argument about the Westphalian "state of nature," America must do whatever it can to avoid the emergence of any "dreadful equality" in enemy nuclear capacity. Here, still more precisely, Washington could learn purposefully from <em>Leviathan</em>, "...the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest."

For a present-day example, no matter how "powerful" this country may first appear vis-à-vis its pertinent adversaries, even a seemingly "less-powerful" North Korea could sometime bring nuclear harms to the United States. We ought not to be looking, therefore, for any engineered or enlightened "democracy" in fashioning US national nuclear capacity.

<em>Prima facie</em>, in the more formal parlance of original Cold War nuclear theory, any nuclear harms would be "<a style="cursor: help" title="For assessment of the probable consequences of nuclear war fighting, by this author, see: Louis René Beres, Surviving Amid Chaos: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2016; 2nd. ed., 2018); Louis René Beres, Apocalypse: Nuclear Catastrophe in World Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980); Louis René Beres, Mimicking Sisyphus: America's Countervailing Nuclear Strategy (Lexington MA: Lexington Books, 1983); Louis René Beres, Reason and Realpolitik: US Foreign Policy and World Order (Lexington MA; Lexington Books, 1984); and Louis René Beres, ed., Security or Armageddon: Israel's Nuclear Strategy (Lexington MA: Lexington Books, 1986).">unacceptable</a>."

Strategy is a "game" that an American president must always be prepared to play with conspicuous skill and also with due consideration of corresponding legal expectations. Behind the manifold complexities of such an expanding chaotic context is the derivative obligation to see things through the eyes of each applicable adversary. Fundamentally, this must quickly become a psychological or psychiatric obligation, one not in any way specific to any orthodox military calculations. It has been succinctly summarized by existentialist thinker Rollo May in <em>The Discovery of Being </em>(1983): "The problem is how we are to understand the other person's world."

Now, of necessity to make these matters more of an analytic problem, we must add: "...during a time of pandemic."

Sooner or later, a visibly stark juxtaposition of pre-modern ideologies with nuclear weapon systems could present a unique challenge to the United States for dealing with <em>chaos</em>. This complex and pandemic-affected challenge could be exacerbated by (a) persistently "opaque" considerations of enemy rationality; and (b) steadily expanding uncertainties of decisional miscalculation and/or <a style="cursor: help" title="Expressions of decisional irrationality in world affairs could take different and overlapping forms. These forms include a disorderly or inconsistent value system; computational errors in calculation; an incapacity to communicate efficiently; random or haphazard influences in the making or transmittal of particular decisions; and the internal dissonance generated by any structure of collective decision-making (i.e., assemblies of pertinent individuals who lack identical value systems and/or whose organizational arrangements impact their willing capacity to act as a single or unitary national decision maker).">escalation</a>. These overlapping factors could become still more daunting whenever the dynamic relationships between them become determinably synergistic at a time of expanding worldwide <em>biological adversity</em>.

There is more. Struggling amid chaos, it should realistically be expected that we would fail to discover any reassuring succor in international law. This plainly regrettable expectation is reinforced not only by President Donald Trump's unilateral US withdrawal from the JCPOA 2015 Vienna Pact regarding Iran, but also by US withdrawal from the INF Treaty with Russia. Today, one might also add Donald Trump's needless and generally injurious attacks on the World Health Organization in Geneva, or his continuing attempt to deflect blame for all pandemic harms upon Beijing.

To be sure, thinking people all over the world are still shaking their heads in disbelief about these wholly destructive and irrational US presidential deflections, actions that further undermine certain residually indispensable features of international law.

One notable consequence of shortsighted Trump behaviors is that the United States will have to deal with effects of a nuclear Iran in a shorter period of time and will then to face simultaneously an expanding nuclear arms race with the Russian superpower. It should prove unsurprising, therefore, when an already palpable global slide toward chaos eventually becomes overwhelming and unstoppable.

What then?

For the US, the expected perils of any emerging primal chaos must be particular and unique. Conceivably, the calculable probability of world system chaos could be enlarged by certain unforeseen instances of enemy irrationality. If, for example, America should have to face a Jihadist adversary that would value certain presumed religious expectations more highly than its own physical survival (e.g., Islamic expectations of a <em>Shahid</em> or "martyr"), this country's applicable deterrent could be correspondingly diminished or even <a style="cursor: help" title="Sub-state organizations impacting US security could conceivably represent terrorist groups. Under international law, terrorist movements are always Hostes humani generis, or 'Common enemies of mankind.' See: Research in International Law: Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to Crime, 29 AM J. INT'L L. (Supp 1935) 435, 566 (quoting King v. Marsh (1615), 3 Bulstr. 27, 81 Eng. Rep 23 (1615)('a pirate est Hostes humani generis'))">immobilized</a>.

Presumptively worst case scenarios would involve an irrational nuclear North Korea or Pakistan; that is, in essence, a nuclear suicide-bomber in macrocosm. Here, once it had been convincingly determined in Washington that enemy leaders were meaningfully susceptible to certain non-rational judgments vis-à-vis the United States, this country's rational incentive to strike first defensively could become overwhelming or even irresistible. Naturally, however, there could then be no reasonable or reciprocal assurances that actively yielding to such an incentive would be in the overall security interests of the United States.

None at all.

There is more. America could discard the <a style="cursor: help" title="In law, there is an important distinction between preemptive attacks and preventive attacks. Preemption is a military strategy of striking an enemy first, in the expectation that the only alternative is to be struck first oneself. A preemptive attack is launched by a state that believes enemy forces are about to attack. A preventive attack, however, is launched not out of concern for any imminent hostilities, but rather for fear of a longer-term deterioration in some vital military balance. ">preemption option</a> - one that would likely be described in more expressly legal terms as "<a style="cursor: help" title="The precise origins of anticipatory self-defense in customary law lie in The Caroline, a case that concerned the unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. Following this case, the serious threat of armed attack has generally justified certain militarily defensive actions. In an exchange of diplomatic notes between the governments of the United States and Great Britain, then U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster outlined a framework for self-defense that did not require an antecedent attack. Here, the jurisprudential framework permitted a military response to a threat so long as the danger posed was 'instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.'">anticipatory self-defense</a>" - but it would then still need to identify other usable and multi-vector strategies of secure <a style="cursor: help" title="In principle, at least, both nuclear and non-nuclear preemptions by the United States of enemy unconventional attacks could lead to nuclear exchanges. Such grievous outcomes would depend, in large part, on the effectiveness and breadth of US targeting, the surviving number of enemy nuclear weapons and the presumed willingness of enemy leaders to risk certain American nuclear counter-retaliations.">deterrence</a>. Any such identification could then further require diminished ambiguity about selected elements of this country's nuclear forces; an enhanced and at least partial disclosure of certain strategic targeting options; more substantial and simultaneously less ambiguous ballistic missile defense postures; and/or increasingly recognizable steps to ensure the perceived survivability of America's nuclear retaliatory forces.

Going forward, America will need serious analytic <em>preparation</em>, not just "attitude." These alternative American strategies should be carefully worked out in advance of any specific <a style="cursor: help" title="But, says Spanish philosopher José Ortega y' Gasset: 'Whenever the new muses present themselves, the masses bristle.' (The Dehumanization of Art, 1925).">crisis</a>. In all such calculations, chaos itself would need to be included as a potentially salient explanatory factor or "independent variable." In short, pandemic-reinforced chaos would maintain its pride of place, however distasteful to America's operating strategists and presidential policy-makers.

At that disintegrative point, there might remain no reasonable expectations of <a style="cursor: help" title="The de facto condition of Westphalian conflict stands in contrast to the jurisprudential assumption of solidarity between states. This law-based assumption concerns a presumptively common legal struggle against both aggression and terrorism. Such a 'peremptory' expectation, known formally in law as a jus cogens assumption, was already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE); Hugo Grotius, 2 De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres, Ch. 20 (Francis W. Kesey., tr, Clarendon Press, 1925)(1690); and Emmerich de Vattel, 1 Le Droit Des Gens, Ch. 19 (1758).">safety in arms</a>, of rescues from higher legal authority or of any comforting reassurances from science. As with any true forms of chaos, new wars could rage until every flower of culture were trampled and until many things human were flattened in a vast and barbarous cauldron of biological disorder. In such dire circumstances, even the best-laid plans for collective defense or alliance guarantees could quickly become little more than iconic cultural artifacts of a world order that had once been "merely anarchic." At that singularly portentous point, Carl von Clausewitz's idea of "friction" (that is, "the effects of reality on ideas and intentions in war") would trump all earlier hopes for both predictability and conflict resolution.

<em>At that fearful point, the only fully predictable insight would be that nothing was any longer predictable.</em>

Some further clarifications are still in order. Since the seventeenth century, our anarchic world can best be described as a <em>system</em>. What happens in any one part of this world necessarily affects what would happen in some or potentially all of the other parts. When a particular deterioration is marked, and begins to spread from one nation to another, the disintegrative effects would quickly undermine regional and/or international stability.

We are still living in a planetary system. But now, there are significant points of difference from classic "Westphalian" legal dynamics. Now, when deterioration is rapid and catastrophic, as it would be following the start of any unconventional war and/or act of unconventional terrorism, the corollary effects would be immediate and overwhelming. These critical effects would be <em>chaotic</em>.

Soon, aware that even an incremental collapse of remaining world legal structures would impact its friends as well as its enemies, leaders of the United States, in order to chart more patently durable paths to survival, will need to openly advance certain credible premonitions of global <em>collapse</em>. Such considerations will be uniformly distasteful, and are most likely not yet underway. Still, even without charting any compellingly precise Spenglerian theory of decline, American strategists ought not seek to avoid this <a style="cursor: help" title="The reference here is to Oswald Spengler's still very illuminating The Decline of the West (1918), a book expressly inspired by Goethe's Faustian conceptions.">obligation</a>.

Determining proper strategic directions for the American future must require a prior awareness of where we seem to be heading - that is, a proper diagnosis and prognosis of world system "pathology."

All things considered, American strategic planners will soon need to consider how best to respond to international life in a bewilderingly chaotic "state of nature." The specific triggering mechanisms of any suddenly accelerated world system descent into chaos could originate from mass-casualty attacks launched against the United States or its allies, or from similar attacks directed against other western democracies.

In all cases, whether or not there had obtained a meaningful "pandemic variable," even the dissembling state of nature would represent a discernible legal <a style="cursor: help" title="In this connection, explicit applications of the law of war to insurgent combatants dates to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. As more than codified treaties and conventions must comprise the law of war, the obligations of jus in bello (justice in war) are part of 'the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations' (from Art. 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice) and thereby bind all categories of belligerents. (See Statute of the International Court of Justice, art. 38, June 29, 1945, 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. 993). Further, Hague Convention IV of 1907 declares that even in the absence of a precisely published set of guidelines regarding 'unforeseen cases,' the operative pre-conventional sources of humanitarian international law obtain and still govern all belligerency. The related Martens Clause is included in the Preamble of the 1899 Hague Conventions, International Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War by Land, July 29, 1899, 187 Consol. T.S. 429, 430.">system</a>. To figure out this system in suitably conceptual and theoretic terms <em>in time</em> would represent a preeminent responsibility of the American president.

Whatever any actual precipitant of chaotic disorder, deterrence <em>ex ante</em>, not revenge <em>ex post</em>, must remain America's overriding <a style="cursor: help" title="Even before the nuclear age, ancient Chinese military theorist, Sun-Tzu, counseled, in The Art of War: 'Subjugating the enemy's army without fighting is the true pinnacle of excellence.' (See: Chapter 3, 'Planning Offensives').">security goal</a>. If, for any reason, especially amid any expanding primal chaos, Washington should sometime lose sight of this objective, the United States could be reminded of that perpetually apt description of Nature explained in Thomas Hobbes' <em>Leviathan</em>: "...every man is enemy to every man...no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society...continual fear and danger of violent death..."

As the lamentably "normal" context for national geo-strategic planning in Westphalian world law, anarchy has always been dangerously unstable.

Left unchallenged, however, an already-emergent chaos would be <a style="cursor: help" title="Recalling the query invoked by philosopher Karl Jaspers in his Man in the Modern Age (1931): 'Is it an end that draws near, or a beginning.'">incalculably worse</a>.

Accordingly, US President Donald Trump must prepare to look far beyond the daily news and conspicuous crises. Now, though plainly unaccustomed to any such longer term analytic assessments, his only proper course must be to solicit policy options from recognizably capable and disciplined scholars, not (per his usual pattern) from narrowly educated and shamelessly deferential political subordinates. If left to the arbitrary and disjointed leadership of Donald Trump, Cold War II amid COVID-19 could propel the United States from anarchy to chaos and from chaos to war and collapse.

None of this is mere hyperbole. "The worst," says Swiss playwright Friedrich Durrenmatt, "does sometimes happen." What then? More than likely, this above-delineated sequence of national descent would trigger a tale of woe and despair without any discernible historic antecedents. It would be such a tale, as described in Hamlet, "whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul."

		<title>3M files new trademark lawsuit in string of price gouging allegations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[3M is back in court with their latest in a string of pandemic related <a href="https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/59b15cdb8b584aef5a2aefb9/5ea8760ed50a616efd9e8dc7/28d5dc2f9aa9cc04157b25ad5f32b6a4/3M_Complaint.pdf">suits</a>, this time with a federal trademark infringement filed Tuesday against a medical supplies company for the resale of N95 masks at inflated prices to the state of Wisconsin.

Similar to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2020/04/3m-sues-new-jersey-company-for-price-gouging/">previous litigation</a> initiated by the country's largest producer of N95 masks surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the suit filed against Hulomil LLC alleges that the "deplorable pandemic profiteer" used the 3M trademark to mislead Wisconsin in believing that the inflated prices of two to three times the actual price of the N95 masks were authorized by 3M.

According to the complaint, "Hulomil recently used 3M’s famous marks as part of a price-gouging scheme to deceive the State of Wisconsin’s Department of Administration into believing that Hulomil had direct access to 3M to sell hundreds of thousands of 3M-brand N95 respirators at a price several multiples of the 3M list price."

"Hulomil did everything it could to suggest that Wisconsin would be dealing essentially directly with 3M - and thus to associate 3M with its price gouging."

In addition to the "exploitive pricing behavior," the complaint alleges that in addition to using 3M's likeness to associate elevated prices with their authorization, Hulomil required Wisconsin to sign a nondisclosure agreement surrounding the sale of some 250,000 masks.

In a <a href="https://news.3m.com/English/press-releases/press-releases-details/2020/3M-Reports-First-Quarter-2020-Results/default.aspx">press release</a> reporting their first-quarter 2020 results published also on Tuesday, 3M doubled down on efforts to combat fraud and price gouging during the pandemic, including working with authorities "<span>to bring lawsuits in multiple states and Canada."</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Without effective human intervention, epidemics and pandemics typically end only when the virus or bacteria has infected every available host, and all have either died or become immune to the disease. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400">World Health Organization has <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">declared</a> that COVID-19 is a pandemic, and t</span><span style="font-weight: 400">he coronavirus has brought life to a standstill. Preventive initiatives have been <a href="https://www.who.int/trade/distance_learning/gpgh/gpgh8/en/">directed</a> towards protecting the frontiers against invasion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Tedros Adhanom, Director-General of WHO, said that a strong health and disease surveillance system obstructs and prevents pandemics which claim lives, deplete economies, and cast a global emergency threat. With no cure or vaccine, the best possible prevention is social distancing and isolation of infected persons. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Governments are often in a dilemma about whether to respond to a safety threat. As Steve Taylor, a professor at the University of British Columbia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-asia-acted-west-dithered-hong-kong-taiwan-europe">said</a>, </span><span>“The challenge faced by government is whether and when to act on a health threat. If you act swiftly and the outbreak isn’t as bad as feared, then government gets criticised for overreacting. If you adopt a wait-and-see approach and move too slowly, then government gets criticised for underreacting.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, most countries are resorting to legislation that specifically deals with the spread of communicable disease. They are incorporating measures such as lockdowns, curfews, and health emergencies, thereby banning international passengers, movement of people in public places, and other similar situations. Hence, we discuss the legislation provisions enacted by different countries to fight the novel coronavirus.</span>

<b>INDIA</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To tackle the coronavirus, the union government <a href="https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/10469/1/the_epidemic_diseases_act%2C_1897.pdf">adopted</a> the Epidemic</span> Diseases Act, 1897. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 sp<span>ecifically deals with preventing the transmission of hazardous epidemic diseases by conferring wide powers on central</span><span> and state governments</span><span> and by penalizing any offenders</span><span>. It authorizes states to ban general meetings, restrict assembly, shut down schools and colleges, and ask offices to pursue work from home. </span><span>Further, the central government <a href="https://www.ndmindia.nic.in/images/The%20Disaster%20Management%20Act,%202005.pdf">delegated</a> the power of home ministry to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare under </span>Section 10(2)(i) and 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005<b>.</b><span> Under this act, the Ministry regulated the sale of surgical masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves. It <a href="https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=200240">added</a> these items as essential items under the </span>Essential Commodity Act, 1955<span> to prevent hoarding and black marketing.</span><span> The government is also taking recourse with the </span><a href="https://www.ihrpoe.co.in/pdf/rules/IA(PH)%20Rules1954.pdf">Aircraft (Public Health) Rules, 1954</a><span>, which warrants a Health Officer to check citizens arriving from abroad at the airport entrance.</span><span> The administration also has recourse under </span>Sections <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/734195/">269</a>, <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1164731/">270</a>, and <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1726256/">271</a> of the Indian Penal Code<span> to ensure effective enforcement of the public healthcare rules. For successive enforcement and effective regulation, we <a href="https://countercurrents.org/2020/03/india-fights-covid-19-where-we-stand">require</a> the amalgamation of public safety laws to efficiently track the execution of reaction to an outbreak.</span>

<b>SWITZERLAND</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Federal Council of Switzerland <a href="https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/insight/publications/2020/03/coronavirus-force-majeure-swiss-perspective">banned</a> activities with more than 1,000 participants, and it may undertake further actions to restrict the spread of COVID-19 based on how the situation progresses in Switzerland.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Restrictions have been imposed on the entry of people, and people are required to stay at home. Schools and colleges have been closed. Violators are to be punished with three years’ imprisonment or fine. The </span>Communicable Diseases Legislation – Epidemics Act, 2010 <span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/gesetze-und-bewilligungen/gesetzgebung/gesetzgebung-mensch-gesundheit/epidemiengesetz.html">provides</a> a three-part model to meet normal, particular </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and extraordinary situations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The following measure ensures effective work-sharing and coordination between the Swiss Confederation and the cantons at national, as well as international, levels. The Confederation provides strategies, while each canton implements the program to prevent the sporadic spread of particular communicable disease. Information exchange acts as a link between the two and provides for strong coordination. The act also includes certain preventative measures in the form of lifestyle and working conditions. </span>

<b>IRELAND</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/28/enacted/en/html">Health Act of Ireland</a> has a chapter that specifically deals with Infectious Disease and Infestation. </span><a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/28/section/30/enacted/en/html#sec30">Section 30 of Health Act, 1947</a><span style="font-weight: 400"> casts a duty on an infected person to prevent the spread of infectious disease. It also punishes the person who conceals infected persons and offers them residence.</span> <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1947/act/28/section/38/enacted/en/html#sec38">Section 38</a> <span style="font-weight: 400">confers powers on a chief medical officer to order the detention of the infected person.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Further, clause 4 of the section punishes whoever resists detainment, misbehaves, attempts to escape, or does not submit peacefully.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Recently, the </span>Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act of 2020<span style="font-weight: 400"> was <a href="https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2020/3/">passed</a> to deal with the rapid rise of coronavirus patients. It was initiated to make exceptional provisions for public safety, so as to tackle the grave threat that human life has succumbed to in the wake of global pandemic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The government also initiated amendments to the Health Act, 1947, so that the Health Ministry can make laws for public safety. </span>

<b>UNITED KINGDOM</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The </span>Corona Virus Act 2020<span style="font-weight: 400"> was <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/7/pdfs/ukpga_20200007_en.pdf">passed</a> in the United Kingdom, which provides emergency powers to UK authorities to cope with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. This power needs to be renewed every six months by Parliament</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Airports can be made </span><span style="font-weight: 400">non-operational</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to avoid entry of people form host nations. The law enforcement authorities are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51964163">conferred</a> unlimited authority to arrest individuals and, if possible, place them within suitable isolation centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to secure vital resources that could be threatened during the epidemic.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> These powers are in absolute proportion to the threat, which the entire globe is facing. As per the act, ports can be shut; tenants are garnered protection form eviction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The act also envisages that recently retired workers will return to work without detrimental impacts on their privileges. </span>

<b>ITALY</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Italy has been the worst victim of the novel coronavirus. Such has been the situation that army trucks are deployed to carry out dead bodies. The situation there has led to a complete lockdown. Government authorities have quarantined not only the northern Lombardy area but also other areas, owing to surprise outbreak. Authorities <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/could-the-us-contain-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">released</a> instructions to shut down schools and libraries, postpone sporting activities and big gatherings, and halt transportation and freight, with the exception of certain pharmacy and grocery stores.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The government <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200131-italy-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus">declared</a> a state of emergency on January 31.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Lack of emergency provisions in the Constitution of Italy posed another challenge for the parliamentarians. The President of the Council of Ministers took control over the crisis and issued certain decrees to contain the spread of the virus. The d</span>ecree on March 8 w<span style="font-weight: 400">as enforced to extend the imposition of restrictive measures to red areas. These restrictive measures were extended to the whole national territory. By the </span>March 11 decree<span style="font-weight: 400">, the government <a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/covid-19-tools-italian-employers-facing-emergency">suspended</a> all commercial activities, excluding public services.</span>

<b>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Quarantine law in the U.S.A. has its origin in the 1700s. These <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/could-the-us-contain-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">regulations</a> have restrictions and can authorize the government to deliberately isolate infectious individuals and societal threats. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-8/clause-3/">Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution</a><span style="font-weight: 400"> legalizes and provides authority to the federal government to impose measures like isolation and quarantine. Pursuant to </span>Article 361 of the A<a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/PHSA-merged.pdf">merican Public Health Service Act</a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to prevent entry and spread of transmissible diseases from abroad. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has been given the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html">authority</a> to conduct such duties.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Because of sluggish initial reaction, the United States experienced shortages in research supplies and medical beds. The </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1650-20490-5258/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf">Defense Production Act</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/coronavirus-news.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span>as invoked</a><span> to allow military hospital ships to be more readily accessible in regions heavily impacted by coronavirus. The legislation was enacted that explicitly allowed the federal government to request American manufacturers to make critical equipment’s like fans, ventilators, gears and safety equipment for health care personnel and to desperately produce required medical supplies.</span><span> To address COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/trump-signs-emergency-coronavirus-relief-bill-into-law/articleshow/74703543.cms?from=mdr">passed</a> legislation for relief measures and economic relief of the masses.</span><span> </span>

<b>SINGAPORE</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/IDA1976">Infectious Diseases Act of 1976</a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (IDA) deals with infectious disease prevention and management in Singapore. The act jointly allows the Ministry of Health and the National Environment Authority to implement the regulation laid down. This empowers the Director of Medical Services to make medical assessment</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and to take care of any patient suspected of being a carrier of communicable disease. He is also empowered to conduct a post-mortem review</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of someone who is believed to be an infectious disease vector. Directors can order treatment of premises or</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> vessels and the closure of ports. They can also order restaurants to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">tackle transmission of an infectious disease. Meetings and gatherings that are likely to increase the proliferation of contagious diseases can also be banned</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Under IDA, the minister can designate a region (within or outside Singapore) as an infected area</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to deter infectious disease from reaching Singapore and causing widespread harm and panic.</span>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Coronavirus is a global health catastrophe, and its far-reaching implications are yet to be uncovered. The priority of the nations is to contain the virus and stop its spread. During the pandemic crisis, the well-equipped healthcare systems across the globe are unable to deliver their services to all their citizens. Specific provisions have been enacted to tackle such crisis and health emergencies. The current crisis requires harmonious construction between special measures and essential safeguards. At the time when COVID-19 is spreading its tentacles across the globe, Ireland’s Health Act is well suited to curb its outbreak. Global leaders have respected Taiwan's preparation for such a pandemic. Successful leadership and expertise, inclusive and mutual industry, government response to medical devices, and methods used to monitor contaminated citizens may be linked to its success.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When contagious disorders arise, legislative mechanisms must be reinforced within the strong structure of public safety laws in areas such as isolation, quarantine, mobility or transportation limitations, community gathering prohibitions, school closures, compulsory vaccination and other modes of protection. The legislation can incorporate provisions similar to Ireland, casting a duty upon the infected person to take precautionary measures to restrict the spread of the disease. By the adoption of the Switzerland model of work-sharing between confederation and cantons, Indian federalism could be strengthened. Gaps and loopholes in the monitoring of the infectious disease needs to be resolved. The government of nations need to work on ground realities.</span>

		<title>Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council orders anti–government protesters&#039; release</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council <a href="https://www.hjc.iq/view-en.67288/">ordered</a> courts on Sunday to release all protesters jailed since anti–government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/iraq-protests-latest-updates-191004085506824.html">demonstrations</a> erupted last October. The Council cited Article 38 of the <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Iraq_2005.pdf?lang=ar">Constitution</a> which guarantees the right to protest so long as demonstrations do not involve acts “contrary to the law” or otherwise violate the Constitution.

This statement comes days after Prime Minister Mustafa al–Kadhimi <a href="https://twitter.com/IraqiPMO/status/1259207897709510656">addressed</a> the nation promising to “hold to account all those who shed Iraqi blood” during months of political unrest, and urged parliament to change early election electoral laws.

Al–Kadhimi’s address spurred a new wave of nation–wide <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/hundreds-gather-baghdad-anti-gov-protests-200510095037978.html">protests</a> on Sunday demanding political reform and immediate government action.

“While releasing the detainees is good, these gestures and any other cosmetic changes are not going to fool the protesters nor quell the protests,” Sinan Antoon told reporters.

"The protests are against decades of corruption and criminality and against a political class beholden to foreign influence and al-Kadhimi is an insider," he said.

Though protesters remain skeptical of al–Kadhimi’s motives, the anti–corruption movement forges ahead. Protesters remain largely undeterred by police brutality and the looming threat of the COVID–19 pandemic.

		<title>Ukraine passes vital anti–corruption banking law to secure IMF deal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Ukrainian parliament, Verkhovna Rada, <a href="https://rada.gov.ua/en/news/News/192634.html">passed</a> a vital anticorruption banking law on Wednesday preventing former bank owners from reclaiming insolvent and nationalized banks. Bill No. 2571–d –– known as the “anti–Kolomoisky” law –– <a href="https://twitter.com/MattiMaasikas/status/1260514646399877120">protects</a> public funds and taxpayers from illegal lending practices. Enacting the law is a major step in securing a $5.5 billion dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Lawmakers passed this bill after PrivatBank –– Ukraine’s largest nationalized bank –– <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/privatbank-hearing/ukraines-privatbank-was-involved-in-fraud-london-court-hears-idUSL5N1UN67C">investigated</a> former shareholders, Ihor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Bogolyubov, for fraudulent lending practices after the bank reportedly lost $5.5 billion prior to being nationalized in 2016.

IMF and the Ukraine have since <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/26/pr20112-ukraine-statement-by-the-imf-managing-director">discussed</a> a three–year, $5.5 billion <a href="https://en.hromadske.ua/posts/what-the-anti-kolomoisky-law-changes-and-whether-its-necessary">loan</a> to help promote economic stability during the COVID–19 pandemic. The IMF loan was contingent on Ukraine's new banking law.

“Without the IMF program, there will be nothing to cover the budget deficit,” Concorde Capital Investment Bank’s research head, Oleksandr Parashchiy, told reporters.

“We should get $7 billion from the IMF. This program will also allow the government to enter international capital markets and borrow $ 2–3 billion there,” Parashchiy said.

The IMF program will help Ukraine access money from other partners, such as the World Bank, the European Commission, and the governments of Canada and Japan. IMF funds will help support Ukraine during the recession, and will finance future COVID–19 expenditures.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pakistan reopens shopping centers after declaring COVID–19 non–pandemic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pakistan’s Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/downloads_judgements/s.m.c._01_2020_18052020.pdf">ordered</a> shopping centers and markets on Monday to reopen after declaring that COVID–19 is “not a pandemic in Pakistan.”

In the court order, Chief Justice Galzar Ahmed warned against using all government resources to fight COVID–19 because doing so would be “highly detrimental to the people of Pakistan,” and would render the country “dysfunctional.”

The chief justice cited concerns over dwindling resources used to treat other diseases requiring urgent treatment, such as hepatitis, dengue, and brain hemorrhages.

“We are not suggesting by any means that the governments should not attend to Coronavirus but we expect that the governments should not put all its resources for this one disease . . . .” Ahmed noted.

Despite Pakistan’s 43,966 <a href="http://covid.gov.pk/stats/pakistan">confirmed</a> cases and 939 <a href="http://covid.gov.pk/stats/pakistan">deaths</a> since March, the federal government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/pakistan-top-court-orders-businesses-reopen-200519065136611.html">welcomed</a> the Supreme Court decision.

“Prime Minister Imran Khan has from day one been saying, and all of the measures we have taken, they are a continuation and they show clarity and a practical approach,” Information Minister, Shibli Faraz, said during a news conference. “You have to create a balance between lives and the economy.”

Pakistani health experts have challenged the government’s optimistic stance on easing preventative efforts. Instead, medical experts strongly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095264/">recommend</a> maintaining lockdown restrictions, advising that premature easing of lockdown could lead to another surge in COVID–19 cases that could have a devastating impact on Pakistan's healthcare system.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of the global pandemic and the nation-wide lockdown, a heavy constraint has been put on individuals as well as the economy. To minimize the impact of the pandemic on the general public as well as business establishments and ensure minimum disruption in the supply chain, many amendments, advisories and announcements have been introduced which would ideally subsist during the containment period, but could have long-term implications. Understanding the ramifications of these developments is essential for the smooth operation of enterprises. One such amendment was the <a href="https://theprint.in/economy/key-labour-laws-scrapped-in-up-for-3-yrs-as-yogi-govt-brings-major-reform-to-restart-economy/416925/">suspension</a> of 35 out of the 38 labor laws for a period of three years by the State of Uttar Pradesh which approved the Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020. This move was followed by other states as well like <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-labour-law-changes-mean-coronavirus-6403611/">Madhya Pradesh</a>, Gujarat and Odisha, among others, though to a smaller extent.

Reports suggest that with the <a href="https://scroll.in/article/961435/is-uttar-pradeshs-decision-to-suspend-35-labour-laws-legal-experts-believe-it-could-be-challenged">exceptions</a> of the Workmen Compensation Act, 1923, the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 and the Building and Other Construction Workers Act, 1996, all other labor related laws have been suspended by the aforesaid ordinance. However, Section 5 of the Payment of Wages Act, which relates to the timely payment of wages, will also continue to be in force.

Though the Ordinance has been approved by the UP Government, it has not received Presidential Assent yet, which is required as per <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf">Article 213</a> of the Indian Constitution. The rationale that has been put forward for such actions is to encourage investment and employment. The idea behind the suspension and dilution is that in the present circumstances, there is a requirement for a certain amount of flexibility for business and industry to cater to the needs of providing employment to the workers who have migrated back to the state and to protect the existing employment of workers.

<strong>The Ramifications of the Move</strong>

While the reforms are well-intended and aimed towards the promotion of investment and industries, the unintended consequences of such a move which can be reasonably foreseen are grave. The governments while defending the move have <a href="https://theprint.in/india/governance/up-suspends-labour-laws-what-stays-what-goes-and-why-it-is-a-step-in-right-direction/417186/">claimed</a> that the workers will continue to be protected, however, this move reminds us of a Machiavelli quote "Never let a good crisis go to waste."

This is a step in the opposite direction when contrasted with the various <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/coronavirus/country-responses/lang--en/index.htm">other countries’</a> response trying to minimize the lay-off by providing wage subsidies and the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-team/un-calls-measures-cushion-covid-19-shocks-labour-market">UN’s call</a> to minimize the impact of the pandemic on workers.

Labor laws can be broadly sorted into four categories based on the objectives that they regulate: conditions of work, wages, social security and industrial relations. The sudden suspension of labor laws would leave the labor force at the mercy of employers on various fronts. Establishments are required to be compliant by providing minimum wages and basic safety standards under some legislation. If an establishment employs more than a certain number of workers, it would require prior approval for closure. There are other statutory requirements such as notice, retrenchment compensation and dues to be paid such as gratuity. There would be a number of employers who would take advantage of the situation and get rid of the employees without the hassle of complying with the formalities. Further, to make matters worse, the suspension itself means that trade unions cannot raise a dispute under the <a href="https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/THEINDUSTRIALDISPUTES_ACT1947_0.pdf">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947, thereby leaving the hapless workers without a grievance redressal mechanism.

<strong>The Constitutional Validity of the Actions</strong>

The Constitution of India confers innumerable rights for protecting and safeguarding the interests of labor under <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf">Part III</a> as well as Part IV pertaining to Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), respectively.

<strong>Freedom to Form Associations</strong>

The freedom of citizens to form associations and unions which is enshrined under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1142233/">Article 19(1)(c)</a> has been curbed by the aforesaid action. It is pertinent to note that association pre-supposes organisation and includes the right to form trade unions within its purview as held in <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1874251/">Kulkarni v. State of Bombay</a>. When all labor laws are suspended, including the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/32075/64876/E26IND01.htm">Trade Unions Act</a>, 1926, this fundamental right is also affected. Moreover, such trade unions voice and represent other employees in case of any dispute before the authorities, which is, in fact, essential in any collective bargaining structure. The very reason for the existence of a trade union is to balance the bargaining power against the employer. Even if it is argued that suspension would be valid under <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1801956/">Article 19(4)</a> which provides for various reasonable restrictions which can be imposed on the grounds of public order or morality or the sovereignty and integrity of India, there is a need to strike a balance between the rights and the restrictions so as to maintain the balance of bargaining power.

<strong>The Right to Life and Its Various Facets</strong>

The scope of the right to life conferred by <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/">Article 21</a> has been expanded to be far and wide-reaching with the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1766147/">Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a>. It is a pandora’s box with its various facets and interpretations. The right to life does not imply a mere animal existence but a right to live with dignity, as held in the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/78536/">Francis Coralie v. Union Territory of Delhi</a>. Moreover, this right also holds within its ambit the right to livelihood, as reiterated in the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/709776/">Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation</a>. In furtherance of the aforesaid action, social security statutes like the <a href="https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/TheMinimumWagesAct1948_0.pdf">Minimum Wages Act</a>, 1948, <a href="https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/WEBTEXT/32063/64873/E87IND01.htm">Factories Act</a>, 1948 and even the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 have been suspended. This leads to a violation of the right to live a dignified life as well as the right to livelihood of laborers and employees as they do not have a guarantee of a fixed minimum income, and the protection against retrenchment or layoffs anymore. The employers are also no more obligated to provide basic standards of safety and care, as enshrined in the Factories Act, 1948 for them.

Ironically, even the grievance redressal mechanism for them, as provided in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is also not available due to the suspension of the laws despite the Supreme Court of India recognizing the right of access to justice as a fundamental right in the case of <a href="https://www.casemine.com/judgement/in/58117f132713e179478e9c8a">Anita Kushwaha v. Pushap Sadan</a> (2016).

<strong>Right of Protection from Exploitation</strong>

In <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1150530/">Sanjit Roy v. State of Rajasthan</a>, it has been held that the payment of wages lower than the minimum wage to a person employed on famine relief work violates <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf">Article 23</a>. Whenever any labor or service is taken by the State from any person, who is affected by drought and scarcity conditions, the State cannot pay him less wage than the minimum wage on the grounds that it is given to them to help meet the famine situations. The State cannot take advantage of their helplessness. Parallels can be drawn from this case in the current situation also. The suspension of the Minimum Wages Act would lead to an exploitative situation by the private as well as public sector employers. This would lead the workers to a situation of forced labor that the Constitution specifically seeks to avoid.

<strong>Directive Principles of State Policy</strong>

Part IV of the Indian Constitution deals with the aspect of Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP), which are non-justiciable in nature. They are ideals which must be kept in mind while the State seeks to formulate policies or enact laws. The basis for many pieces of labor welfare legislation, including social security laws is found in the DPSPs.

<a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1673816/">Article 38</a> seeks to promote the welfare of the people by securing social, economic and political justice and minimizing inequalities in income, status and opportunities. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/555882/">Article 39</a> seeks to secure to the citizens, <em>inter alia</em> the right to adequate means of livelihood for all citizens, equitable distribution of material resources of the community for the common good and prevention of the concentration of wealth and means of production. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1975922/">Article 41</a> states that in cases of unemployment and disablement, the state shall secure to its citizens the right to work. As per <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1256023/">Article 43</a>, the states are required to secure a living wage, a decent standard of living and social and cultural opportunities for all workers. <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/854952/">Article 51</a> bestows a duty to foster respect for international treaties and obligations.

Through the suspension of labor laws, the welfare of the employees is not promoted, rather they are deprived of the means to secure social and economic justice. This would indeed increase the inequalities in the income of employees. Moreover, the means of livelihood of the employees can be disrupted in accordance with the whims and fancies of the employer with no legal recourse available to them. In the case of <a href="https://indiankanoon.org/doc/176622/">Daily Rated Casual Labour v. Union of India</a>, it was held that "job security" is an essential ingredient of the right to work and must be read in the light of the socio-economic philosophy of the right. By suspending labor laws, there would also be an absence of security of employment and living wage, along with a decent standard of living.

Moreover, the aforesaid suspension would also be against the international obligations of India drawn by the ratification of various <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm">international labor conventions</a>. Therefore, the instant suspension and dilution would lead to a violation of the DPSPs as well, that ought to be protected by the State.

<strong>Labor Reform is Needed, But Not at the Expense of the Labor Force</strong>

The objective to increase investment and employment by relaxing the labor laws is optimistic of the government. India had already been experiencing an <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/severe-slowdown-when-will-the-indian-economy-recover-and-how/articleshow/72310684.cms">economic slowdown</a> which was essentially a problem of demand in the economy. The relaxation of labor laws is a reform towards the increase of supply and would intensify the demand problem due to the unavailability of disposable income among a large class of people, i.e., the labor force.

The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/modi-govt-proposes-major-labour-law-changes-for-ease-of-compliance-119072400056_1.html">Central Government</a> agrees that major reforms in the field of labor laws are required due to the presence of multifarious legislation dealing with different aspects of labor law. The Central Government sought to consolidate the existing laws into <a href="https://labour.gov.in/labour-codes">labor codes</a>, which could be said to be a step in the right direction to ease compliance with the laws. The complete suspension of the laws to attract investment and reduce the compliance burden is patently illegal from a Constitutional perspective.

Even the situation of a global pandemic due to COVID-19 does not justify the deliberate neglect of the labor force. It is particularly in these times that the State must take steps in order to protect their interests. Paradoxically, the response of other countries such as the UK, Canada, etc. has been positive to support the employees and the employers in the time of crisis. This suspension could lead to a wanton "hire and fire" policy by employers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we watch the revival of the first wave and anticipate an inevitable second wave, the intentionally inept federal, uneven and dangerous state and local, and self-interested business response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a horrifying experience. As the reality of the situation unfolds, the breach of public trust is breathtaking. The clear indifference of large swathes of the governing class to the welfare of the citizens whom they are sworn to protect is monstrous.

When does that monstrosity start to look like a crime or even a crime against humanity?

<strong>I. Domestic Crime – A French Precedent</strong>

From the start of the AIDS epidemic around 1983 until 2000, I lived in France. One of the most dramatic events in the course of that epidemic was the case of the French government response with respect to blood transfusion testing for HIV/AIDS. Families of hemophiliacs accused the former Prime Minister, the former Minister of Social Affairs and National Solidarity, and the former Secretary of State for Health of the crimes of involuntarily causing the death or involuntarily causing the poisoning of certain hemophiliac persons who received transfusions of non-heated blood infected with HIV during a period in which a heated blood method was available from an American laboratory.

As detailed in the commission for instruction report of the French Court of Justice of the Republic when the decision was made to send some of the cases to the criminal courts, the argumentation might be of interest as we look at the government response to the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

With respect to the then-Prime Minister, the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.liberation.fr/societe/1998/07/21/proces-du-sang-contamine-trois-ministres-responsables-l-arret-de-renvoi-precise-les-faits-imputes-au_242079__;!!LoBwcKfm!1WAN9WIhWiSbhIdVmdyfSK3fQknSGdRsk03qL2F8qnzF4IaLHt_l2ypdaHjNV31AGak$">commission of instruction</a> noted that:
<blockquote>A head of government who says he is determined to act against what he considers an epidemic, who announces that the testing of blood donors would permit the avoidance of several hundred people each year developing AIDS, cannot argue he was diligent while tolerating that the contamination of the receivers of the blood be prolonged for several weeks, with the sole reason being the French manufacturer of the test was not yet operational.[“] We are forced to note, contrary to appearances, that the approach taken by [the then-Prime Minister] with respect to the testing matter does not correspond to what we have the right to expect in terms of public health.”</blockquote>
While rejecting responsibility for the Prime Minister on this second point of the delay with the diffusion of the heated blood, the commission of instruction was also very tough on the Minister of Social Affairs and National Solidarity and Secretary of State for Health, <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.liberation.fr/societe/1998/07/21/proces-du-sang-contamine-trois-ministres-responsables-l-arret-de-renvoi-precise-les-faits-imputes-au_242079__;!!LoBwcKfm!1WAN9WIhWiSbhIdVmdyfSK3fQknSGdRsk03qL2F8qnzF4IaLHt_l2ypdaHjNV31AGak$">to wit</a>:
<blockquote>"[T]heir negligence, inattention, and lack of prudence and security, their lack of response to an order on the selection of blood donors, the lack of prohibition of collection of blood from risky populations, created conditions that made the injury of the hemophiliacs in question possible. With respect to the lack of follow-up with those who had received transfusions (to see whether they had or had not been contaminated in the months of high risk), the magistrates noted that the Minister of Health having abstained from taking any initiative to make these follow-up interviews mandatory must bear the liability in part for these indirect contaminations which could have been easily avoided.”</blockquote>
What is instructive for us today in the United States is that these excerpts point to a focus on both acts and omissions of these high governmental officials with dramatic consequences for the hemophiliacs. This concept of evaluating both acts and omissions of high governmental officials on health in another epidemic in a foreign country causes one to ponder the acts and omissions of high governmental officials here in the United States now in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the statute of limitations, only a subset of the cases presented were allowed to go forward. Ultimately, the highest court in France, the Cour de Cassation, weighed in on the matter in deciding to acquit the former Prime Minister and the former Minister of Social Affairs and National Solidarity and condemn the Secretary of State for Health on one count. However, due to the 15 year passage of time since the events, they ordered him not to have any punishment.

The <a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/en/constitution-of-4-october-1958">Cour de Cassation</a> noted that the French Constitution at Article 68-1 confirmed the autonomy of the criminal liability of members of a government in cases of serious crimes or other major offences committed by them during their office without making a distinction between voluntary and involuntary infractions.

It noted also that it was not for a Court - whose role is to apply the positive law - to evaluate whether it is appropriate to apply such law.

It further noted that political choices are for the legislature, and the Court in exercising its judicial functions was not to arrogate to itself a role of arbitrator of the French political life without compromising the normal functioning of the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.courdecassation.fr/autres_juridictions_commissions_juridictionnelles_3/cour_justice_republique_616/decisions_7973/mars_1999_36751.html__;!!LoBwcKfm!2hhH6aX-ffgBx1txuPUnkNVnbuEj0pGiV06-jsEYvMiM8Qh1toPLti_D5hfE2MBTPb0$">institutions</a> of the French Republic.

In particular, the Cour de Cassation made short work of the prosecutor’s argument highlighting the risk that ministers in the future would be required to explain their political choices before the Court of Justice of the Republic, with a result of substituting judicial oversight for what should be a subject of democratic oversight. This would create a “regrettable confusion of powers” in subjecting the actions of the executive power to the appreciation of judges.

The Court stated that political liability - even if the idea, its criteria and its implementation were defined specifically, which is not the jurisdiction of the Court – is not exclusive either of civil or administrative liability of the State nor of criminal liability.

<strong>II. Return to America: What We Can Learn from the French</strong>

What is instructive in the above French case was that criminal liability was sought and imposed against high government officials for acts and omissions in dealing with the health crisis in that country. The fact that they were high governmental officials at the time they did these acts did not protect them from criminal liability – the French Constitution made that explicit. he fact that they had made policy choices within the scope of their work and would suffer some ill-defined political liability did not make the state immune from civil or administrative liability, nor these ministers immune from criminal liability when those acts and omissions were so devastating for injured and dead citizens.

In the United States no such explicit rule is found in our U.S. Constitution with respect to the criminal liability of high governmental officials. The only specified process in that Constitution is the political process of impeachment which we saw this year which if convicted has the person removed from office and no longer able to hold office in government, but results in no civil, administrative, or criminal liability.

The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-immunity-scotus-specialrep-idUSKBN22K18C?taid=5eb548a563ff0700018722c5">Supreme Court</a> in a series of cases going forward from <em>In Re Neagle</em>, (1890) has provided a form of <a href="https://www.unlawfulshield.com/2019/10/supreme-court-may-be-preparing-to-consider-several-major-cases-on-qualified-immunity/">qualified immunity</a> for federal officers operating in the scope of their authority. And no doubt the same issues of qualified immunity are addressed in various manners by state law and judicial decisions. And such qualified immunity might be extended to government contractors who do work for the government in the current COVID-19 crisis pursuant to an order under the Defense Production Act. In the presence of a federal or state order on how private citizens are to act, it is possible that private businesses might be able to assert compliance with governmental orders in a form of quasi-immunity for civil and possibly <em>de facto</em> criminal liability.

Having looked at this area of law over the years with respect to criminal prosecutions of high-level governmental officials and a former President for torture and other crimes, without going into too much detail, the path is murky. However, unlike what we see enshrined in French law, through case law or prosecutorial discretion it does appear that there is a path through for such governmental officials or private businesses to escape any criminal liability for their acts or omissions in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

But that murky way through is clearly a concern.

At least in Ohio and in Congress, there are <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/05/15/colleges-seek-protection-lawsuits-if-they-reopen">efforts</a> to pass COVID-19 Immunity Bills. The Ohio version of such a bill (Ohio Senate <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/solarapi/v1/general_assembly_133/bills/sb308/IN/00?format=pdf__;!!LoBwcKfm!2sTo-aQngYSi0eju8vAh4-2PB78orw4ZT3un4L9MI5wzWZkcRoMbdr47489cmk75XGg$">Bill 308</a>) ostensibly seeks to revise the law governing immunity from civil liability and professional discipline for health care providers during disasters or emergencies, to provide qualified civil immunity to service providers providing services during and after a government-declared disaster, and to declare an emergency. The act is to apply retroactively to the date a disaster is declared by the federal government, state government, or political subdivision of the state.

One can question whether it is appropriate to provide such immunity to health providers extracting them from the ordinary duties of care required of them in their addressing those who come to them.

But, this bill goes farther.

Tucked in the end of the bill is a definition of services and service providers that encompasses pretty much all of the private or not-profit activity in Ohio. Article A(4) defines "Services" as meaning
<blockquote>“providing lodging, sheltering, groceries, pharmaceutical products, fuel products, other products, retail merchandise, manufacturing, care, religious or nonprofit services, or other acts that are part of or outside the normal scope of a person's business or nonprofit activities during the period of a declared disaster and not more than one hundred eighty days after the end of the period of the declared disaster.”</blockquote>
The bill goes on to define “service provider” in Article A (5). "Service provider" means any person providing the services described in division (A)(4) of this section, including that person's owner, officer, director, employee, or agent.

And all these persons are granted immunity except if it is established by clear and convincing evidence that the service provider's act or omission is intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct. Thus, the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in civil matters is thrown out for a higher standard. And this higher standard in these civil cases of clear and convincing evidence coupled with the kinds of intentionality, willfulness, or wanton disregard seems to exclude civil liability for recklessness. As to a criminal case, given this proposed law and prosecutorial discretion if a relevant statute were present, the kind of criminal case that was brought in France would appear highly unlikely to prosper in any but the most extreme case against a person in a public or private entity in Ohio. And if a version of this Ohio draft were passed at the federal level, such cases would be unlikely to prosper for the same reasons across the United States.

In sum, on the domestic front, through a combination of executive, legislative and judicial approaches at both the federal and state level the ordinary citizen that is sickened or dies due to the act or omissions of public or private entities risk being at an impasse in seeking civil or criminal accountability of either public or private actors for how they treat ordinary people in the COVID-19 pandemic.

<strong>III. Enter Customary International Criminal Law</strong>

All of the analysis above of the French and American experience has been done in the domestic law contexts of each country.

What about international law?

First we start with one of the <a href="https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf">cardinal rules</a> of international law that no state can invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty which is also a customary international law rule.

In such a view, the combination of acts and omissions of the executive, the legislator in such immunity legislation, and the judiciary in the application of the various doctrines of qualified immunity at the state or local level all form together the domestic state response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While one could look in international human rights law for grounds for civil liability, this note is much more interested in criminal liability if one considers these acts or omissions at all levels of society monstrous.

One way of thinking about this is whether there are customary international criminal law rules on crimes against humanity that might be applicable to the United States. For example, the Statute of the International Criminal Court defines a crime against humanity as any of a series of acts when committed as part of a <strong>widespread or systematic attack</strong> directed against <strong>any civilian population</strong>, with knowledge of the attack. Those acts include persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender, <strong>or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law</strong> as well as other inhumane acts of a similar character <strong>intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health</strong>. An attack directed against any civilian population is further defined as a course of conduct involving the <strong>multiple commission of acts referred to in that section against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack </strong>[emphasis added].

There is a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jicj/mqq070">debate</a> as to what extent the Statute of the International Criminal Court states <a href="https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=mjil">customary international criminal law rules</a> (crystallizes rules applicable to all states) or creates new rules (progressive development) that bind only signatories. Prudence is encouraged in approaches to identify customary international criminal law rules and prosecute actors.
<blockquote>“For International practitioners should be cautious in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317996151_The_Identification_of_Customary_Rules_in_International_Criminal_Law">identification</a> of customary rules in international criminal law, so as to prosecute and punish suspects of international crimes without endangering the principle of legality.”</blockquote>
But, independent of such criminal liability through prosecutions or applicability of customary international criminal law, it might be possible to turn on its head the analysis of the French Cour de Cassation and think of these customary international criminal law rules as defining a form of political liability. That redefinition then might help galvanize efforts within the United States to understand the multilevel process that intentional or not risks leaving so many to sicken and die at the hands of COVID-19.

Let us think out loud about some of the civilian populations toward which a widespread or systematic attack might be found in the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be more.

If workers are made to “volunteer” to go back to work or face the loss of unemployment and/or CARES Act benefits where their workplace is a death trap such as in the meat industry, then federal, state, local, and business interests are committing such a widespread or systematic attack on those workers. If the local or national worker protection laws as applied do not, in fact, protect workers, but endanger them and if the courts turn a deaf ear to the pleas of these workers in harm’s way they are thrown to the wolves. For those workers at grocery stores, gas stations, medical personnel, and any other type of work where COVID-19 can easily spread, the same is true.

Given that the specific needs of the elderly in assisted care-living and the workers there have not been met so that we find significant clusters of death at these places, this group of vulnerable population form another type of victim.

While in US domestic law we tend to shy away from the effect of policy and focus on the intent of policy, international law recognizes both purpose and effect. The disproportionate sickness and death toll among racial minorities that appears widespread forms another civilian population under attack by the sum of the responses at all levels.

Clusters of COVID-19 cases for workers and detainees in prisons and detention centers are being found each day.

With the suspension of the normal rules of civil and likely criminal liability, any customer or student who gets sick or dies becomes a potential victim of the acts or omissions by the executive, legislative or judicial powers at the state or federal level and the public or private entity immunity. It should be noted that this appears to be a more amorphous group then the other four here to be a true civilian population, but the point is that we are thinking in terms of political movements.

As if to emphasize their culpability, the federal government has provided denialism, weak help in addressing the pandemic, and inconsistent and contradictory guidance. The reopening states have ignored even the correct guidance of the federal government and some are hiding statistics of infections as they play with fire. Local communities have acted like the Amity mayor in Jaws trying to keep the beaches open in the face of a clear and present danger. And the business community, maximizing shareholder value, has engaged in price arbitrage on PPE, taken the CARES Act money and run, and now seek that Congress and states shield them from any liability to customers or workers for reopening.

The picture is of course not all one sided for there are many laudable persons and entities at all these levels who are doing what they can to attempt to protect these vulnerable populations from the monstrous response.

If local law possibilities do not provide relief or only piecemeal relief in the context of a worldwide pandemic, if we care about workers, the elderly, racial minorities, prisoners and detainees, and potential other civilian populations such as customers and students in more than a lip-service sense, we might consider taking a more international or transnational view of the human rights violations that may rise to be crimes against humanity that are leading to their sickness and death for profit. That, international view, even without criminal prosecution can then help us crystallize our understanding of what is going on.

With that understanding, we may then be able to galvanize efforts to resist the forces of monstrosity and encourage the forces that protect the human condition and preserve human life. We can do that by finding what levers within society would vindicate the customary international criminal law rules identified through either civil, criminal, political, or democratic actions.

This COVID-19 pandemic may be calling us to that kind of response when we fear that the double security of the rights of the people so touted by James Madison might be being flouted rather than helped in our separation of powers and federalism.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[India is a vast country that has perplexing socio-economic features which are indicated in medical systems. Every 6th person in the world lives in India. Understanding the esteem of the health system in a country is crucial to both national and international health because the competitiveness and accessibility is highly fluctuating for distinct segments of the population. Digital healthcare in India is primarily embattled in remote locations where modern medicine is not easily reachable and it has the potential to improve the quality of health care. Many programs need to be set-up and they will have a sustainable impact only if government involvement and support is there for further advancement especially in rural areas.

In this blog, the author shall explain how digital healthcare is important for delivering value-based care across the healthcare continuum in India. The author shall discuss some reports made by various organizations which show that most Indians do not currently benefit from digital healthcare. Next, the author shall explain the historical evolution of digital healthcare since the 20<sup>th</sup> century. After this the author will highlight the major initiatives taken by the Government of India which help in reducing the stress-level of patients and medical professionals. Finally, the author shall highlight the applications of digital healthcare that very soon will reach their true potential.

According to the 15-country <a href="https://www.livemint.com/">Future Health Index</a> (FHI), India is a global leader in digital health technology.  Research has found that about half (49%) of all Indians do not know about the benefits of digital healthcare such as mobile health apps, etc. In order to learn the benefits and become willing to adopt telehealth, providing education and information will be vital in taking Indians along this digital healthcare journey. A study revealed that when Indian healthcare professionals are supported by digital healthcare, they get more exposure which means their patient’s experiences improve.  The study found that about 67% of Indians reported an increase in convenience when taking medical advice from healthcare professionals through a healthcare application on their phones or other electronic devices.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says in a report that India needs three-times the doctors that it has now. The ratio of doctors to patients is currently 1 doctor for every 10,000 patients which shows that there is a need to increase the number of doctors in India.

India is now embarking on an  adventure to bridge the gap between haves and have not’s by operating <a href="https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/india-to-become-the-world-leader-in-digital-health/55154100">digital health tools</a> and initiatives.  It has the potential to transfigure or modernize the interaction between populations and National Health Services. The Government of India has been attempting several health initiatives in the field of digital healthcare.

In the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, we find the earliest record of telemedicine when an ECG was transmitted over a telephone.  Telephone played a crucial role in starting modern medicine as we know it. From then until recent times, digital healthcare has come a long way. <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/tmj.2010.9964">Telemedicine</a> was considered to be far away from providing prognosis and treatment patients by way of using telecommunication devices.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>In 1924, </strong><em>Radio News Magazine</em> was introduced. It was a type of communication with <em>microphone</em> and <em>TV</em> <em>with </em><a href="http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.4258%2Fhir.2015.21.4.223"><em>Medical Professionals</em></a></li>
 	<li><strong>In 1959, </strong>the first face time video consultation was used to <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/586073">transmit neurological examinations</a> at the University of Nebraska.</li>
 	<li><strong>In 1997, </strong>at Yale University MITAC (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3918958?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Medical Informatics</a> and Technology Applications Consortium) was established.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1751%28199707/09%2912%3A3%3C236%3A%3AAID-HPM486%3E3.0.CO%3B2-D"><strong>NASA and ISRO</strong></a> also played a major role in telemedicine during the <strong>1985</strong> Mexico City Earthquake, and during Soviet Armenia Earthquake in <strong>1988</strong>.</li>
</ul>
Though telemedicine has not been the solution for all of the problems in Indian healthcare, it did help to significantly reduce the burden on the healthcare system. In this way we can see that telemedicine has been a part of Indian healthcare <em>since the 20th Century</em>.  It has not only brought the world closer but has also helped eliminate distance as a barrier in the attainment of quality healthcare.

Online delivery of health services is at the core of any digital health ecosystem. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has been taking many productive initiatives in the field of digital health. Many digital platforms are being introduced to ensure continuity of care and other connected benefits to mitigate the shortage of health human resources, affordability of healthcare services, and accessibility of healthcare frameworks.

Some eHealth initiatives for the public healthcare of India are:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Vaccine tracker </strong><a href="https://www.immunizeindia.org/"><strong>mobile application</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This app helps parents to check immunization progress of their children and provides reminders for upcoming vaccinations.</li>
 	<li><strong>The India fights </strong><a href="https://www.nhp.gov.in/mobile-app-dengue"><strong>Dengue mobile application</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This app gives direction about the identification of symptoms of dengue and helps connect the users to the nearest blood banks and hospital.</li>
 	<li><strong>The </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhp.ui&amp;hl=en"><strong>Swasth Bharat mobile application</strong></a><strong>: </strong>This app gives details about living a healthy life, diseases and their symptoms, and how any specific disease should be treated, and also gives information about things that may alter health.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kilkari-project-on-health-advice-to-roll-out-friday/"><strong>Kilkaari application</strong></a><strong>:</strong> This app helps in sending audio messages about the pregnancy, birth of child, care of the child directly to the parents and families of the child.</li>
</ul>
In addition to these initiatives there have been many initiatives developed by the Indian Government to ease the problems arising for remote locations, where travelling conditions are tough and difficult. These initiatives include <em>Online Registration System, </em><a href="https://www.eraktkosh.in/BLDAHIMS/bloodbank/stockAvailability.cnt"><strong>E-Rakt Kosh</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/rishabhnahar6/amn-on-line-anmol-in-health-facility"><strong>Anm Online (ANMOL)</strong></a>, and many more applications to help reduce the stress levels of the public and medical professionals.

In 2005, the National Health Ministry of India set-up various initiatives and projects like Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Arogyasree (Internet-Based Mobile Medicine) which connects multiple hospitals and medical professionals from rural and urban areas, NeHA (National eHealth Authorities) to achieve high quality <a href="http://www.jfmpc.com/article.asp?issn=2249-4863;year=2019;volume=8;issue=6;spage=1872;epage=1876;aulast=Chellaiyan">health services</a>, and Village Resource Center (VRC), developed by ISRO for tele-education and connecting specialty hospitals and expert doctors to the villages.

In 2013, the MoHFW developed <em>Electronic Health Record</em> to ensure safe data records during telecommunication medicine.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_AYUSH"><strong>AYUSH</strong></a>, also called <em>Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy,</em> was implemented in 2015 in order to promote the traditional methods of healing to a larger population through telecommunication. It was the backbone of <a href="http://www.nihfw.org/NationalRuralHealthMission.aspx"><em>Ayushman Bharat Yojna</em></a>. Today, the following applications are used in digital healthcare:
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Facetime:</strong> Where both sender and receiver are online at the same point of time and there is a live transfer of information occurs.</li>
 	<li><strong>Store and Forward Healthcare Tips: </strong>Here, the sender stores the information and sends it to the receiver or user at any convenient point of time and the receiver can review the data according to their convenience.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/technology-changing-health-care-india/"><strong>Remote Monitoring</strong></a><strong> Type Digi-Healthcare: </strong>It is also known as self-testing. It uses a range of electronical devices to observe the health and clinical signs of a patient remotely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
With these tools, health professionals can access specialty healthcare, referral and consultation services from another health professional easily. Health professionals can give information to <a href="https://indiadigitalhealth.net/">unreached patients</a> by giving them access to these tools<strong>.</strong>

Digital healthcare cannot be a solution for every problem. However, it can be crucial in addressing a far range of problems. Services like facetime, and store and forward healthcare tips are proving to be wonders in the field of digital healthcare. National and international digital healthcare initiatives are bringing the world closer. It has been proven to create no barrier in obtaining quality health-care. Lack of awareness, acceptance and access of new technology by the general population of India and medical professionals are holding this technology back despite it having so much potential.

The Indian government, having keen interests in developing more and more telemedicine advancements have started many initiatives in the hopes that Digital Healthcare in India will reach its <a href="https://yourstory.com/2018/01/boom-digital-healthcare-indias-opportunity-build-global-telemedicine-companies.">true potential</a>.

		<title>Can China Be Sued under International Law for COVID-19?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Under the immense human and economic loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have mentioned that they are willing to file lawsuits against China. Do they have any basis for filing a lawsuit? In the current state of international law, is the claimant State required to prove negligence or breach of a international legal duty to receive any compensation from China?

In fact, according to the fundamental principles of international law, violation of state international obligations or commission of any internationally wrongful act by a State engages its international responsibility. Thus, the claimant states should prove that China has violated its international obligations. In this case, only an internationally wrongful act, such as the breach of an international treaty or the violation of another state’s territory, will be taken into consideration. There are no general legal duties and obligations that apply to China as a violation of international law.

In this perspective, to engage the Chinese government’s international responsibility, which court has competence for this kind of lawsuit? There are four possible scenarios for a lawsuit against China.

First of all, a lawsuit could be brought in national courts. According to the principles of international law, the national courts are not competent to entertain an international dispute between states. As mentioned above, the individual complaints in domestic courts have no legal basis so China can invoke its immunity from such jurisdiction. In a case where any local court made a judicial decision in this matter and ordered compensation from China, that decision would not be enforceable. In addition, the judicial doctrine called “sovereign immunity” or “state immunity” offers foreign governments a protection against prosecution in American courts. The doctrine protects the Chinese government or its political subdivisions, departments, and agencies from being sued without its consent in any country including in the United States.

Second, a lawsuit could be brought in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ is one of the principal judicial bodies of the United Nations for settling disputes between states. For a court to be competent for settling this claim, the court must obtain the consent of the adverse countries to resolve their differences. In this case, neither China nor the United States recognizes the jurisdiction of the court, so the ICJ has no competence to render a judicial decision for this possible lawsuit.

Third, the International Criminal Court (ICC) would be another option. The ICC prosecutes individuals for international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. In this particular case, neither China nor the United States has ratified the Rome Statute. For this reason, there is no international court competent for a state to bring a claim against China.

The last option is the UN Security Council which has the power under the ICC’s Rome Statute to refer cases to the ICC or adapt a resolution against China based on its “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security." In this case, China could use its right to veto because the Security Council’s veto power is granted solely to the Security Council's five permanent members: China, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Russia.

Is it possible for these countries to win the case? What would be a reasonable reaction to the Chinese government? Legally speaking, each type of national or international court has its own jurisdiction, which means that it has the authority to decide specific types of cases. Any government or individual could file a lawsuit against the Chinese government seeking remedies for causing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, based on the principles of international law, it seems that there is no national or international court competent to bring a claim against China.

Judicial action against China is not an immediate response for the pandemic crises that are affecting all of humanity in the world. The principle of cooperation has been considered as one of the cornerstones of international law. According to this principle, all states have an obligation to cooperate in such a situation collectively. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) plays an essential role in the matter.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On the 29th of April 2020, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) released its <a href="https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/USCIRF 2020 Annual Report_Final_42920.pdf">Annual Report</a> for 2020. The report has recommended the US State Department to classify the People’s Republic of China as a "Country of Particular Concern" in Tier I and impose targeted sanctions on China for engaging in violations of religious freedoms. USCIRF has acknowledged state-sponsored religious persecution of Uighur Muslims. It is estimated that approximately <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ">1.5 million</a> Muslim minorities are detained in concentration camps in Xinjiang. This is not the first time Uighur Muslims have grabbed the attention of the world. Earlier <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/china-holds-million-uighur-muslims-concentration-camps-180912105738481.html">revelations</a> from detainees report that they suffered from torture, rape, and sterilization among other abuses. Such an authoritarian regime raises serious concerns in the times of a pandemic. China has not only failed international standards of freedom of religion, but also stands in violation of the International Health Regulation, 2005 (IHR).

The extreme <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/media-censorship-china">censorship laws</a> in China are well known. China censors its press to the extent that religious persecution of Uighur Muslims took almost three years to draw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/07/why-uighur-muslims-across-china-are-living-in-fear">global attention</a>. In times like COVID-19, it becomes even more difficult to collect information on Uighur Muslims, particularly about their living conditions including whether the concentration camps are receiving basic amenities to fight the pandemic like soaps and face masks. China stands in <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/taking-china-to-the-international-court-of-justice-over-covid-19/">violation</a> of <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/ihr/WHA58-en.pdf">Article 7</a> by actively concealing information during a public health emergency. It is pertinent to note concealing information is in violation of certain basic civil and political rights of the Chinese citizens as well, which certainly includes Uighur Muslims.

Earlier <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/defense/news/the-wuhan-coronavirus-has-hit-xinjiang-where-china-has-imprisoned-at-least-1-million-uighur-muslims-its-filthy-detention-camps-will-make-inmates-sitting-ducks-/articleshow/73583409.cms">reports</a> that shed light on the deplorable conditions of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang paint a disquieting picture. There are about 465 camps spread over the region with extremely poor infrastructure. Poor sanitation and hygiene conditions are depicted by the fact that residents have to use plastic buckets as toilets. Where the world aims to fight COVID-19 by practicing and professing <a href="https://theconversation.com/social-distancing-what-it-is-and-why-its-the-best-tool-we-have-to-fight-the-coronavirus-133581">social distancing</a>, the Uighur Muslims have to live in exceptionally small rooms where people take shifts to sleep. Even if one inmate from a camp gets infected the lives of millions will be at stake and China might not do anything about it. The world will never know due to the censorship laws.

<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/ihr/WHA58-en.pdf">Article 42</a> of the IHR mandates for the state to ensure that implementation of health measures are carried out without delay and in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner. China has successfully controlled media in Xinjiang province in order to avoid the real numbers of COVID-19 patients from being revealed. However, it is feared that under the garb of COVID-19, China might carry out mass extermination of Uighur Muslims. The International Uighur Muslim Community (IUMC) has <a href="https://uighurtimes.com/index.php/rebiya-kadeer-world-health-organization-must-take-action-on-behalf-of-uyghur-people/">called</a> for a delegation to be sent from the World Health Organization to the concentration camps to check and control the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition to this, to cover-up a shortage of laborers, China is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51697800">forcing</a> Uighur Muslims to work as laborers. This is an outright discriminatory practice which is being ignored and needs immediate attention.

Even though China claims to have controlled the spread of COVID-19, due to the authoritarian nature and extraordinary circumstances in China, it has become almost impossible to cross-check any information put forth by China. If China has controlled the spread of the virus at all, international agencies should demand statistics to confirm the real figures of casualties, especially in Xinjiang province. In addition to that, the demand of the IUMC for a WHO delegation must be met. Countries in a position to impose individual sanctions on China and condemn its outright crimes against humanity by publicly advocating rights of the persecuted minorities must do so. For the world should not ignore the most vulnerable groups in times of a crisis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In his famous novel, <em>The Plague</em>, Albert Camus discussed the idea of plague as being akin to a despotic rule under which everyone, starting from the warden to the humblest delinquent, was under a life sentence. This insight is true for any pandemic including COVID–19 because the infection spreading microbe infects both rich and poor people alike.

However, the literature on the motif of plagues and pandemics expounds one naked truth: that a pandemic thrives on human inequities and it is inextricable from the society, economy, knowledge, and politics of human existence. During any infection outbreak such as COVID–19, it is the poorer and weaker fractions of a society that remain disproportionately affected and ultimately bear an additional burden of early death.

In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a complete lockdown for 21 days on March 24th as an extraordinary measure to contain the spread of coronavirus. This measure suddenly brought our informal sector to a screeching halt, putting all our informal workers in the midst of a medical and economic <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-perils-of-an-all-out-lockdown/article31136890.ece">crisis</a>. The government was not able to handle the economic fallout for the poor. The position of the poor in the government’s post-lockdown crisis management strategy is best described in the words of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-lockdown-coronavirus-threat-covid-19-spread-6335042/">Prakash Bhanu Mehta</a> that, “in the entire framing of the problem, the poor have been at best an afterthought, at worst expendable damage.”

While declaring the lockdown, the government forgot about its Economic Survey 2018-19, which estimated the total size of India’s informal workforce as 93%. Neither did it recall the Niti Aayog’s report "Strategy for New India @ 75" which determined the size of the Indian informal workforce at 85%.

The statistics regarding inter-state labor migration are equally staggering. In 2016, the government published new data on the flows of migrants in the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/Survey-uses-Big-Data-for-first-time/article17124449.ece">Economic Survey of India</a> 2016-2017. The Survey highlighted a significant upward trend in the inter-state migrations from the previous estimates taken in 2001. Between 2001 and 2011, the average interstate migrations were around <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/interstate-migration-in-india-doubled-between-2001-2011-wef/articleshow/61225119.cms">4.5%</a>, with "work/business" being the primary reason for migration. The <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Politics/bK0wi486ff4HkV3NDcCTVI/Economic-Survey-2017-says-labour-migration-higher-than-earli.html">2016–2017 survey</a> found that an average of nine million people migrated between states every year either for better employment or education opportunities. The poorer states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh witnessed the highest net out-migration rates and states like Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra remained popular migration destinations.

Despite this sheer amount of data on the informal economy and migrations, the government was somehow unable to predict the mass exodus of migrants that would ensue after it declared a complete lockdown. Chinmay Tumbe, author of "<a href="https://indianexpress.com/audio/the-sandip-roy-show/understanding-how-india-migrates-with-chinmay-tumbe/6348164/">Understanding how India Migrates</a>," has argued that while big cities are a source of economic security for the migrants, migrants experience social security in their native villages/towns. This is because the families of most of the migrants reside in the villages that provide them with support. They also have access to other public security measures such as the public distribution of food in their villages.

Preferably, the government should have anticipated that after it unilaterally declared a complete lockdown (first phase), millions of informal workers would suddenly lose every way of earning their livelihoods and would be rendered penniless. This would inevitably trigger a mass exodus among the poor informal sector workers, forcing almost one-third of the 1.3 billion people who are living a hand-to-mouth existence, to gather on the streets and trek back home with their belongings. The state also took two days to announce a paltry sum of Rs. 1.7 lakh crores as economic relief to the informal workers who have been turned refugees overnight. This is only 0.5% of the national income if existing budgetary allocations are taken into account.

This is an insidious form of assault on the well-being and physical and mental security of the poor population of India, especially so when they are already outside the social security net because they do not fall within the organized sector.

All this begs an important question – Is India really on track to achieve its commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals? This inquiry becomes crucial because, for a long time, India has <a href="https://niti.gov.in/verticals/sustainable-dev-goals">maintained</a> that it has “comprehensively covered the social, economic and environmental dimensions of development and has focused on ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions.” PM Narendra Modi’s avowed agenda of inclusivity, “Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas” which closely translates to "togetherness of all, development of all" has featured prominently in his addresses to world leaders in different international conferences and summits.

During the World Sustainable Development Summit 2018, Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.narendramodi.in/pm-modi-addresses-world-sustainable-development-summit-538963">reminded</a> the international community that India was mindful of its deprived areas and was working to uplift them economically and socially on par with other communities. In his statement to the world dignitaries at the UN Summit for the Adoption of Post-2015 Development Agenda, Modi categorically declared that:
<blockquote>“Since Independence, we [government] have pursued the dream of eliminating poverty from India. We [governments] have chosen the path of removing poverty by empowering the poor. We [governments] have placed priority on education and skill development.”</blockquote>
By adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, India committed itself to achieving all the SDGs by 2030. But even before that, it pledged to ensure that no one will be left behind and India will endeavor to reach the furthest behind first.

This principle of "Leaving No One Behind" (LNOB) is rooted in a human rights-based approach to development and is central to the action required to achieve the SDGs. If any state is not able to achieve this principle, the entire set of global goals themselves, and their vision for a <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/development-co-operation-report-2018_dcr-2018-en">shared future</a> would not be achieved.

LNOB cuts through the trickle-down economic growth approach. That approach still functions on the strained logic that more economic growth means more money and less poverty. LNOB promotes an anti-poverty as well as anti-discriminatory agenda.

According to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), two groups of people are most likely to be locked out of global progress, namely those facing "Absolute Deprivation" and those suffering from "Relative Disadvantage." "Absolute Deprivation" has been <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/poverty-reduction/what-does-it-mean-to-leave-no-one-behind-.html">defined</a> as “multidimensional poverty or [living] below other minimally accepted standards of security, income, public services, infrastructure or well-being.” Unlike traditional poverty which only considers economic indicators such as income, Multidimensional Poverty calculates poverty across a range of indicators such as healthcare, education and living standards to inform decision making. It also considers the myriad ways in which people experience poverty. In India, most of the poor migrants working in the informal sector are absolutely deprived. They are the most susceptible to multidimensional poverty.

Admittedly, India has made some progress in altering the continuous upward trajectory of multidimensional poverty. According to the 2018 <a href="https://ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/G-MPI_2018_2ed_web.pdf">Multidimensional Poverty Index</a> (MPI), India not only reduced the incidence of multidimensional poverty to 28% from 55% in the last ten years, but it also saved around 271 million people from the grips of poverty. Again the 2019 Global Multidimensional Poverty Index has recorded the fastest <a href="https://ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/G-MPI_Report_2019_PDF.pdf">absolute reductions</a> in the MPI values for India. It also stated that India “demonstrated the clearest pro-poor pattern at the subnational level, with the poorest regions reducing multidimensional poverty the fastest in absolute terms.” Jharkhand, which is among the poorest Indian states, witnessed a mammoth drop in the multidimensional poverty rates from 74.9% to 46.5%.

These figures show that India’s efforts towards SDGs are concrete and delivering results. However, we are not winning the battle against poverty. In fact. we have barely scratched the surface. There are still <a href="https://www.in.undp.org/content/india/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2019-MPI-India.html">373 million Indians</a> who are surviving in acute deprivation with an additional 8.8% of the population living in severe multidimensional poverty. Further, 19.3% are still vulnerable to multidimensional poverty. This clearly shows that India is far from achieving its pledge of "Leave No One Behind." Thus India cannot now achieve the 17 SDG goals and their respective targets. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development and this requires India to take "<a href="https://www.unfpa.org/resources/transforming-our-world-2030-agenda-sustainable-development">bold and transformative steps</a>."

India is unlikely to achieve LNOB unless poverty eradication and inclusive development sit at the apex of its national efforts. Mere courage and collaboration between our regular citizenry - the medical professionals, researchers and scientists -- is insufficient by itself to combat a pandemic such as COVID-19. It is equally important that our governments take quick and robust decisions and implement effective policies. But this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/dev.2014.43">requires</a> “overcoming the resistance of entrenched institutions and mindsets” which is an enormous challenge in itself.

The COVID-19 outbreak is yet another demonstration of how the Indian poor are systematically excluded from the government’s policy-making. A case in point is the government’s failure to account for the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52210888">40 million</a> poor and homeless children before declaring the lockdown. Sanjay Gupta, director of a Delhi-based NGO working for street children and child laborers, has argued that millions of homeless children who live unnoticed under flyovers, in narrow lanes and by-lanes are the worst affected due to the lockdown. These children now remain hungry for two or three days at a stretch waiting for authorities to show up and distribute some food.

There is also the recent case of Jamalo Madhkam, a 12 year old child who lost her life while walking back to her village in Chhattisgarh. After the government declared a lockdown, all the work ceased in Telangana chili farms, forcing Jamalo Madhkam and other migrants to walk back home. Jamalo Madhkam could not complete the journey and lost her life after walking for three days and covering around 100 Km. The cause of her death has been reported as electrolyte imbalance and exhaustion. However, the real cause seems to be the government’s anemic policies in which welfare of the poor is at the bottom of its agenda. No doubt, extending the lockdown was necessary, but so was making transportation and other arrangements for the poor, and especially children like Jamalo.

The COVID–19 episode in India has proved that, to date, the voices of the poor are unheard in the decision-making and policies that affect them the most. Further, data and evidence regarding them are least likely to be considered by the government when framing policies.

There is a widespread belief in India that SDGs have been a part and parcel of India’s longstanding tradition and heritage. This could remind us of Mahatma Gandhi’s social thought which he left behind months before his assassination,
<blockquote>“Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?”</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cyberoperations against healthcare providers and testing facilities are thriving in the U.S. and beyond. An unsuccessful act against the U.S. Department and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-16/u-s-health-agency-suffers-cyber-attack-during-covid-19-response">Health and Human Services</a> was intended to <a href="https://www.bitsight.com/blog/coronavirus-pandemic-highlights-government-cyber-vulnerabilities">undermine</a> the administrations’ response to the current crisis. <a href="https://kafkadesk.org/2020/04/19/fears-mount-over-cyber-attacks-against-czech-hospitals-and-healthcare-sector/">Operations</a> against several <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/czech-hospital-cyberattack-coronavirus/">Czech Hospitals</a> and the <a href="https://www.itproportal.com/news/paris-hospitals-targeted-in-major-cyberattack/">Paris Hospital Authority</a> attempted to disable networks of healthcare providers and testing facilities, which further impacted the delivery of health services. Numerous other unsuccessful hostile cyberoperations received less attention from the press.

Existing international law protects healthcare providers against cyberoperations more comprehensively during war than during peacetime. Diverse and ambiguous positions of states, sometimes even complete silence of relevant authorities, may send a message of impunity to malicious intruders and to potential future wrongdoers. The impunity that seems to follow these hostile acts creates a different type of harm. This article aims to identify the justifications for states’ hesitation or passivity to respond to low-scale cyberoperations, that don’t rise to the level of the use of force, in particular during the current pandemic.

<strong>Attribution</strong>

Attribution is a <strong>sine qua non</strong> condition for invoking state responsibility in case of transboundary cyberoperations and for justifying a response consistent with international law. While factual attribution addresses the reasonable certainty of determining the responsible state or proxy for a particular operation, legal attribution defers to the law of state responsibility. <a href="https://ridt.co/d/rid-buchanan-attributing-cyber-attacks.pdf">Experts</a> have argued that “attribution is what states make of it.” The purposes of public attribution can include public outreach (outlining standards of behavior), coercion (disarming malicious actors by exposing their intelligence), and deterrence (creating onerous legal repercussions and discouraging repetition by same or other wrongdoers). The ultimate attribution <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2014.977382">goals</a> often depend on the incurred or potential damage, which frequently limits the resources and the time invested into investigations. Although states are not required to present the intelligence they relied upon when making attribution determinations, a rationale highlighted by the <a href="http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/bjil/vol35/iss1/5">US</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century">UK</a>, some sort of evidence is usually <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/rule-book-on-the-shelf-tallinn-manual-20-on-cyberoperations-and-subsequent-state-practice/54FBA2B30081B53353B5D2F06F778C14">expected</a>. Nevertheless, in absence of a common standard of proof and transparency about the extent of evidence underlying attribution, categorical determinations which justify legitimate responses are rare. To date, no customary international law rule indicates the acceptable or necessary “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/346DD8EBEB55C47469060CC3E9871538/S2398772319000321a.pdf/bumpy_road_to_a_meaningful_international_law_of_cyber_attribution.pdf">level of attribution</a>,” i.e. level of certainty for establishing state responsibility for cyber actions. The Tallinn Manual 2.0. (Rule 80) leaves this challenging coordination to states’ discretion.

Until a few years ago, states were reluctant to openly attribute cyberacts to other states. More recent coordinated public denouncements of responsibility demonstrate a shift from past trends. The evolution of <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/warning-issued-uk-usa-healthcare-organisations">collective responses</a> is relevant for future approaches to “collective countermeasures,” which are currently widely regarded as being incompatible with international law. <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Confidence-Building_Measures_in_Cyberspace.pdf">Several</a> recent <a href="https://www.internetgovernance.org/2017/06/04/a-global-cyber-attribution-org/">efforts</a> evaluate the practicalities of creating an international attribution mechanism for state-sponsored cyber operations against foreign targets.

It is important to clearly differentiate between cyberoperations which are governed by domestic law and transboundary actions which are subject to international law. In an effort to avoid classical consequences of formal attribution, some “derivatives” of typical attribution procedures have emerged. First, “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F7FBB757CF9F597A7818FEEB6015DBD6/S2398772319000345a.pdf/attribution_by_indictment.pdf">attribution by indictment</a>” capitalizes on domestic criminal law provisions, which states enforce transnationally in order to outline an expected behavior in cyberspace. Secondly, although international law legitimizes only states to use countermeasures, governments do not have a monopoly on the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/36189FEEC7937C0588C1A782BDBB4395/S2398772319000333a.pdf/decentralized_cyberattack_attribution.pdf">accusation function</a>. Targets have no legal grounds to develop hack-back operations in response to cross-border cyberoperations, but they are allowed to pursue <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/36189FEEC7937C0588C1A782BDBB4395/S2398772319000333a.pdf/decentralized_cyberattack_attribution.pdf">private attribution</a>, whereby potentially erroneous attribution entails low political risks.

The question is therefore, why healthcare providers which were targets of recent cyberoperations refrained from “naming and shaming.” Although the most evident reason might be lack of evidence and capabilities to identify the intruders, targets often prefer to disclose <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/12133-czech-hospitals-brace-for-imminent-cyberattack">limited information</a> on their sources, methods, vulnerabilities, and on the incurred damage, for example regarding leaks of <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480425/Cyber-gangsters-hit-UK-medical-research-lorganisation-poised-for-work-on-Coronavirus">private data</a>. Another explanation is lack of coordination with state authorities, although in the past, US officials have been open to receiving <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/cybersecurity-research-reports-kaspersky-symantec-microsoft-us-government/">notifications</a> prior to public disclosures or <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/security-firm-china-is-behind-the-opm-hack">information-sharing</a> for private attribution of state-sponsored cyberoperations.

<strong>Foreign Affairs</strong>

This widespread sense of impunity for malicious cyberoperations has driven some states to support regional and global efforts for cyber deterrence and accountability of wrongdoers. Endeavors towards transparency and clarification on application of international law can be observed in <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/kyberturvalisuse_strateegia_2022_eng.pdf">Estonia</a>, <a href="http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/uploads/2018/03/revue-cyber-resume-in-english.pdf">France</a> and <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map/strategies/national-cyber-security-strategy-1">the Netherlands</a>, as well as in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/deterrence-in-the-cyber-age-speech-by-the-foreign-secretary">UK</a>, which detailed its exposure and response <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf">mechanisms</a>. A slightly different perspective was shared by the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf">US</a>, which adopted in 2018 the doctrines of “persistent engagement” and “defend forward”, emphasizing the role of the military in conducting intelligence operations for collecting and disruption of malicious cyber activity.

Outlining standards of behavior is particularly important in the context of attribution. Public attribution, especially if it takes place in a coordinated fashion among nations, has the potential to articulate shared understandings of prohibited behavior in cyberspace and to contribute to deterrence of future operations. However, at this stage, no formal attribution has been made publicly for any of the recent hostile cyberacts against medical facilities.

The political aspect of attribution includes assessment of physical, financial, or reputational damages, and a wide range of public policy and strategic implications. To name a few, states are aware that public statements have significant implications in terms of their normative commitments, both for creation of customary international law, and regarding governments’ future positions. States' silence is also determined by fears of exposing their own vulnerabilities, offensive or defensive capabilities, and even jeopardizing deterrence, and national security strategies. Lack of transparency regarding the investigations of cyberoperations, as was also the case during recent <a href="https://www.somdnews.com/emergency_notice/st-marys-health-department-deals-with-cybersecurity-incident/article_51629cc5-85b7-509e-847e-df9075b96d91.html">incidents</a>, is often criticized, because it hampers identification and development of state practice.

Public expectations to follow up on attribution with robust responses or countermeasures are relevant decision-making factors. While weak responses, such as delayed public attribution or <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/strange-wannacry-attribution">symbolic sanctions</a> against wrongdoers, might create domestic contempt, international tension generated by solid responses, and risks of cyber escalation discourage governmental attributions in the first place. In addition to vague government reactions, recent hostile operations in the Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/en-lutte-contre-le-coronavirus-les-hopitaux-de-paris-victimes-d-une-cyberattaque-20200323">France</a>, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/05/europes-largest-private-hospital-operator-fresenius-hit-by-ransomware/">Germany</a>, and the US, interfering with delivery of healthcare services also demonstrated lack of transparency and trust of victim hospitals and their reluctance to share information.

Some law enforcement agencies are developing their own hacking programs to track down malicious actors and computers. Secret <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9A66B622C2AC43319D8FA45C75D8B5D2/S2398772317000599a.pdf/tallinn_hacking_and_customary_international_law.pdf">cyber-exfiltration operations</a>, being conducted without host countries’ consent, raise serious questions of legality and potential violation of other states’ sovereignty, a position already endorsed by the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2017/583137/IPOL_STU(2017)583137_EN.pdf">European Parliament</a>. Although they might be valuable for attribution purposes, these efforts may trigger disruptive foreign relations <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=349115115064088014083092115091095064046063048046095065028125079121067000023007027108103013042047060122055020118086029001121005116054021030082000087067115115114079101086055022027115008098101104076086077071026097066104098121023114076072126114113084090126&amp;EXT=pdf">implications</a> and escalation under an alleged justification of anticipatory self-defense. Ideally, investigation and attribution processes rely on cooperation with foreign states under the 2001 Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, although the practical disclosure challenges persist.

<strong>Consequences of Responses and Sanctions</strong>

I have <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/cyber-operations-against-medical-facilities-during-peacetime">recently</a> analyzed international law rules applicable to state-sponsored cyberoperations against medical facilities and possible reactions to unlawful state practices, originally developed for responses to non-cyber means. States can use <em>inter alia</em>, mechanisms for international cooperation, means of peaceful dispute settlement, and employ acts of retorsion, including the “naming and shaming” practice. If the harmful act represents a violation of international law, and can be attributed to a state, states can engage in peaceful countermeasures. The <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=976118072096020069103118030072109096059080095032024041078114020074022110098094073125031006120043049043112118114065004118115091044000063069006099028003005064026086028032061002004120104088093127093086122096069027071125113078100095122086100095119070117089&amp;EXT=pdf">purpose</a> of countermeasures must be the return a situation of lawfulness. In the current context the practical benefices of countermeasures are hampered by foreign policy considerations, concerns on proportionality, and the uncertainty regarding the threshold of the use of force. An armed attack under <em>jus ad bellum</em> can activate the victims’ right to engage in <a href="https://harvardnsj.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/02/Schmitt-NSJ-Vol-8.pdf">self-defense</a>. To date, <a href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/cp155.pdf">no state</a> has publicly outlined its response within the international law framework of countermeasures or invoked the right to self-defense in response to cyberoperations.

At their core, sanctions are <a href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/cp155.pdf">policy tools</a> able to change, limit, or criticize in normative terms the behavior of another actor. While coercion is clearly regarded as the main purpose of a sanction regime, constraint and signaling disapproval to different audiences also play a significant role. The coordination of sanctions with other foreign policy tools, security and trade instruments, remains the recipe of their <a href="https://graduateinstitute.ch/research-centres/global-governance-centre/targetedsanctions-initiative">effectiveness</a>, a highly controversial feature of sanctions. States’ prudence can also be explained by probable escalatory effects of sanctions and their long-term consequences, as well as potential indirect consequences which are often hard to predict. The flexibility of sanction regimes is particularly relevant for the cyber domain, as a perfect transposition of sanction regimes from the kinetic world is still highly debated. While US administrations started in 2014 to respond to harmful cyberoperations, the efficiency of the 2019 <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/05/17/cyber-attacks-council-is-now-able-to-impose-sanctions/">EU cyber sanctions regime</a> was not yet tested.

Although the deterrent effects of attribution and responses developed for the physical world are debated, recourse to these reactive measures reflects an increased state recognition of international law rules in cyberspace. Recent condemnation of hostile cyberoperations against healthcare and testing facilities by the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/30/declaration-by-the-high-representative-josep-borrell-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-malicious-cyber-activities-exploiting-the-coronavirus-pandemic/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Declaration%20by%20the%20High%20Representative%20Josep%20Borrell,%20on%20behalf%20of%20the%20European%20Union,%20on%20malicious%20cyber%20activities%20exploiting%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic&amp;fbclid=IwAR0WOZjP44MqYjZsnYEHhDM7rn8hgx9M7qUqwadCMtT9bzkv2tkWSFEtjoc">EU</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-5-may-2020">UK</a>, and <a href="https://www.baltictimes.com/estonia_condemns_cyber_attacks_against_czech_healthcare_facilities/">Estonia</a>, is an important step ahead. Without specifying the type of intended consequences, US <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-concerned-by-threat-of-cyber-attack-against-the-czech-republics-healthcare-sector/">Secretary of State Pompeo</a> suggested that the US is prepared to take collective action with allies against cyberattacks threatening human lives, a position very much <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2020/04/20/whats-behind-states-warning-on-czech-hospital-attacks-786989">welcomed</a> in the international security community. Public condemnations are very important, but clear association of hostile acts with the specific international law rule that was violated will bring additional normative value, and contribute to a common understanding as to the applicability and interpretation of specific rules of conduct in cyberspace.

<strong>Uncertain Application of International Law to Cyberspace</strong>

As primary architects of international law, states are prudent when taking public positions on evidence and responses relating to cyberoperations. The vagueness of these declarations mirrors the fragmented interpretation and application of international law rules and norms to cyberspace, including with regard to the Tallinn Manuals. States are even more reluctant to publicly denounce cyberoperations which don’t meet the threshold of the use of force, or which have limited to no physical consequences. This approach could be exploited by hackers who try to minimize effects to be “below the threshold” of an armed attack, as was the case in the recent cyberoperations against hospitals. States and nonstate actors who employ cyber tools recognize the improbability of solid state responses, especially of a kinetic response. These unfortunate events offer states the context to shape and express positions on controversial issues, such as the threshold of an armed attack, the scope of cyber due diligence and of “critical state infrastructure.” These are fantastic opportunities for building the bricks of customary law, interpretation of existing principles, and articulation of “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/B2B45B05750572E78FBD835D104E7EAD/S2398772319000084a.pdf/on_the_shelf_but_close_at_hand_the_contribution_of_nonstate_initiatives_to_international_cyber_law.pdf">norm-making laboratories</a>,” such as the Tallinn Manuals, especially because conversations on specific cases are <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/application-international-law-state-cyberattacks-sovereignty-and-non-intervention">regarded</a> to be more successful than abstract legal conversation.

<strong>Human Rights Law</strong>

Numerous scholars analyzed the compatibility of past US, UN and EU sanctions against natural and legal persons with international human rights instruments. Several international bodies, such as the <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1694&amp;context=yjil">Courts of Justice</a> of the <a href="https://www.ejiltalk.org/kadi-showdown/">EU</a>, the UN <a href="https://perma.cc/95ND-H76N">Human Rights Committee</a> and the <a href="https://lovdata.no/static/EMDN/emd-2008-005809-2.pdf">European Court of Human Rights</a> addressed legality of targeted sanctions in several cases and concluded that limiting freedom of movement and the right to dispose of one’s property, may infringe human rights safeguards, especially regarding compliance with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CAB97B0BB45DE0D128E0C17F39DF5A95/S2398772319000254a.pdf/due_process_is_in_the_details_us_targeted_economic_sanctions_and_international_human_rights_law.pdf">due process</a>. Whether states’ reluctance to respond more firmly to cyberoperations can be attributed to concerns regarding human rights repercussions and critiques related thereto, is questionable. The U.S. has signed, but has not ratified the American Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. While it ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the U.S. has argued that the Covenant does not apply <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/state-department-iccpr-memo.pdf">extraterritorially</a>, i.e. when it acts against foreign nationals abroad, as it is the when applying targeted sanctions.

<strong>A Widespread Sense of Impunity</strong>

Cyber attribution is a sophisticated exercise, especially given the technical features of evidence and absence of a commonly agreed standard of proof. Uncertain attribution practices affect the legitimacy of legal action and often lead to impunity of cybercriminals. The <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/61AA5CC087FC50963B2A15C86DBF49D1/S2398772319000096a.pdf/slow_process_of_normativizing_cyberspace.pdf">normativization process</a> in cyberspace is constant, but repetitive, and recent trends show political will to operationalize existing international law. Recent hostile acts against healthcare facilities demonstrated the need to pair evolution of existing international law rules and norms with trust and accountability. In this respect, calls for a growing role of the UN Open-Ended Working Group (<a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/amid-covid-related-cyber-threats-netherlands-leads-un-efforts">OEWG</a>) are very justified. Following the Netherlands’ assertive <a href="https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kingdom-of-the-netherlands-response-pre-draft-oewg.pdf">submission</a> in preparation for the next group session, the OEWG should capitalize on its mandate to coordinate state views to achieve a stable and secure cyberspace. The Geneva Conventions were drafted in the aftermath of a devastating war. Perhaps, the silver lining of recent malicious cyberoperations is the opportunity for states and multilateral fora to clarify application of international law, endorse norms, and assert their credibility on the international landscape.
