Judge John G. Koeltl granted the motion after it was filed Tuesday, finding that Stewart's terminal health condition qualified her for "compassionate release."  Koeltl <a href="http://lynnestewart.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Lynne8-9-13comprelOpinionandOrder.pdf">previously denied</a> [decision, PDF] a similar motion, but indicated that a motion from the BOP could change the outcome. Stewart was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-lawyer-convicted-of.php">convicted by a jury in 2005</a> [JURIST report] on charges of conspiracy, giving material support to terrorists and defrauding the US government for smuggling messages from convicted terrorist <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/923/000099626/">Omar Abdel-Rahman</a> [NNBD profile] to members of his militant <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/archive/wtc01/algamaa.htm">Islamic Group</a> [CNS backgrounder]. A <a href="http://lynnestewart.org/2014/01/01/lynne-arrives-back-in-new-york-city-today/">statement</a> [text] on Stewart's advocacy website indicated that she would return to her home in New York on Wednesday. 

<p>Last year, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-10-year-prison-sentence-for-civil-rights-lawyer.php">upheld a ten-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] for Stewart. Stewart's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/civil-rights-lawyer-lynne-stewart-sentenced-to-10-years-for-aiding-terror-client.php">sentence was increased</a> [JURIST report] to ten years from 28 months in 2011 after a federal judge found that she had shown no remorse for her crimes. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/second-circuit-affirms-civil-rights.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] Stewart's conviction in 2009, but ordered the district court to reconsider her sentence, finding that the current 28-month sentence was "out of line with the extreme seriousness of her criminal conduct." Federal prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/long-sentence-urged-for-rights-lawyer.php">sought the maximum sentence</a> [JURIST report] of 30 years for Stewart, saying that her "egregious, flagrant abuse of her profession ... deserves to be severely punished." In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/civil-rights-lawyer-lynne-stewart.php">Stewart was disbarred</a> [JURIST report] in the state of New York after her voluntary resignation was rejected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Little Sisters filed a <a href="http://walshslaw.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/little-sisters-v-sebelius-supreme-court-injunction-application.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] for an emergency injunction Tuesday after the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/194944174/10th-Circuit-ACA-Order">declined to issue an injunction</a> [order] earlier that day. The injunction applies to the Little Sisters as well as several other religious groups that use the same health plan. Sotomayor ordered the government to respond to the application for injunction by Friday. At that time, she will decide whether or not to lift the injunction. 

<p>The contraception mandate has been a subject of legal uncertainty since the PPACA was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report]. In September, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-review-contraception-mandate.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the constitutionality of the mandate. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/09.17.13_opinion_affirming_denial_of_pi.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Autocam Corp., a manufacturer of car and medical supplies, must comply with the PPACA's contraception coverage mandate. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that family-owned, profit-making businesses cannot challenge the new federal health care law's birth control mandate on religious grounds. The previous month, however, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Hobby Lobby may challenge the mandate on religious grounds. In February the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/obama-administration-loosens-regulations-allowing-religious-nonprofits-to-opt-out-of-birth-control-c.php">issued a new rule</a> [JURIST report] that details a broader exemption to the contraception mandate, allowing for religious nonprofits that object to providing health insurance coverage for birth control to opt out of the requirement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security-technology-and-liberty/court-rules-no-suspicion-needed-laptop-searches-border">complaint was filed</a> [press release] by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU), and the <a href="http://www.nacdl.org/">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a> (NACDL) on behalf of dual French-American citizen Pascal Abidor, who had his laptop searched and confiscated at the Canadian border, and the <a href="https://nppa.org/">National Press Photographers Association</a> (NPPA) [advocacy websites]. Abidor's laptop was confiscated in May 2010, and when it was returned to him 11 days later there was evidence that his personal files, including intimate conversations and personal photographs, had been searched. The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] defended the policy of suspicionless searches of laptops by stating that it does not violate the First or Fourth Amendments and that it is necessary for border officers to effectively work without threat of litigation or loss of evidence of crimes. The DHS permits two categories of information to be retained without probable cause: information relating to immigration, customs, and other enforcement matters in compliance with privacy and data protection standards; and any terrorism information encountered in the course of a border search so that it can be shared with the appropriate persons in the federal government. In his opinion, Judge Edward Korman ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing, and stated that even assuming the allegations in the complaint established standing, closely related principles of declaratory judgment law warranted dismissal. Moreover, declaratory relief was not appropriate because of the unlikelihood that a member of the plaintiffs will have his electronic device searched at the border, and Korman stated that it is far less likely that a comprehensive forensic search would occur without reasonable suspicion. In regards to Abidor's allegations, the court found that the specific circumstances may have warranted reasonable suspicion. An appeal is under consideration.

<p>In March, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-raises-standard-for-border-inspections-of-laptops.php">ruled in a related case</a> [JURIST report] that in order to conduct a forensic analysis of a laptop the government must have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. In June 2011, DHS <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/crcl-border-search-impact-assessment_06-03-13_1.pdf">released</a> [report, PDF] its December 2011 Civil Rights/Civil Liberties Impact Assessment of its electronics search policy, concluding that suspicionless searches do not violate the First or Fourth Amendments. The report was in response to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/freespeech/laptopfoia.pdf">2009 ACLU request</a> [text, PDF] under the <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> [official website]. The ACLU also filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/freespeech/acluvdhs_laptopcomplaint.pdf">complaint for injunctive relief</a> [complaint, PDF] against DHS policies in 2009, shortly after the policies were revised. DHS policies caused concern among legal scholars, who believe  that DHS's laptop search policies have <a href="/hotline/2009/08/laptop-searches-at-us-border-implicate.php">serious Fourth Amendment concerns</a> and that border searches of laptops could be a <a href="/hotline/2009/09/government-laptop-border-searches.php">slippery slope</a> [JURIST op-eds] toward accessing US citizens' electronic records. Warrantless searches of laptops at the border have also been <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-senator-challenges-warrantless.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by former US Sen. Russ Feingold (D-WI), who stated in 2008 that they are an unacceptable invasion of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The detainees, Yusef Abbas, Saidullah Khalik and Hajiakbar Abdul Ghuper, were the last three members of the Chinese ethnic minority being held at the facility since their 2001 capture in Pakistan. US District Court Judge Ricardo Urbina <a href="paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 that the detention of the Uighurs was unlawful, though the US has delayed their release to find a country that would accept them. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby called the transfer "a significant milestone in our effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay."

<p>The three detainees were the last of the 22 Uighurs to be released from Guantanamo since the 2008 ruling. Two were <a href="paperchase/2012/04/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-released-to-el-salvador.php">released to El Salvador</a> in April 2012.

The <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/indian-president-signs/940188.html">new law</a> [AFP report] creates a corruption ombudsman with extensive power to prosecute politicians and civil servants to create a "bribe-free India." The bill was <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/india-approves-historic/927014.html">approved by parliament</a> [AFP report] with support from both the ruling Congress and the opposition <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP) [party website]. <a href="http://pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] called the law, under which he himself could potentially be prosecuted, "historic and landmark legislation." The law comes in the wake of a two-year anti-corruption movement that has swept the nation as India gears up for general elections this May.

<p>Governmental corruption has been a topic of serious discussion in India in recent years. In July the Supreme Court <a href="paperchase/2013/07/india-supreme-court-rules-convicted-lawmakers-must-vacate-positions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that elected representatives convicted of serious crimes must immediately vacate their positions and be disqualified from future elections. The anti-corruption bill was <a href="paperchase/2011/12/india-upper-parliament-house-fails-to-pass-anti-corruption-bill.php">stalled</a> [JURIST report] in the upper house of parliament in December 2011.  The bill failed to pass after an abrupt reversal by the ruling Congress, a move criticized by the opposition party. The lower house of parliament <a href="paperchase/2011/12/india-lower-house-of-parliament-passes-controversial-anti-corruption-bill.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Three similar applications to the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit have been <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rejects-Utah-state-request-to-block-same-sex-marriages.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report]. The attorney general argues that the district court's decision to strike down the ban on same-sex marriage is an "impermissible federal intrusion on state power" to define marriage. The application also states that same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah, and "each one is an affront" to state interests. The attorney general concludes that a stay is "urgently needed" to minimize the "enormous disruption to the state and its citizens of potentially having to unwind thousand more same-sex marriages" if the Supreme Court should agree with Utah that the district court exceeded its constitutional authority. A response is due Friday.

<p>The rights of same-sex couples has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. Last month the US District Court for the District of Utah ruled that Utah's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The same day that the Utah ruling was issued, the Uganda parliament passed a bill limiting the rights of same-sex couples and imposing a penalty of up to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for involvement in homosexual relationships. Earlier that week, New Mexico's high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/new-mexico-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">ruled that it is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. The same week, the US executive branch announced that it would begin <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/obama-administration-to-begin-processing-social-security-payments-to-same-sex-couples.php">processing Social Security payments</a> [JURIST report] to surviving couples in accordance with a US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruling </a>[JURIST report] issued this summer which struck down the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text], a federal statute that defined marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes and refused to recognize any other type of marriage.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/assets/documents/GPB_1_GUNS_BILL_LBD_12007_03_3.pdf">New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act</a> [text, PDF], known as the SAFE Act, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">enacted in January 2013</a> [JURIST report] and is among the most restrictive gun laws in the country. Judge William Skretny stated that the challenged provisions banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are legally sound because they "further the state's important interest in public safety, and do not impermissibly infringe on ... Second Amendment rights." However, Skretny found that the seven-round limit provision of the SAFE Act, which makes it "unlawful for a person to knowingly possess an ammunition feeding device where such device contains more than seven rounds of ammunition," is not "substantially related" to the government interest in public safety. Further, Judge Skretny found that the provision in direct conflict with the Second Amendment:<blockquote>This provision, much more so than with respect to the other provisions of the law, presents the possibility of a disturbing perverse effect, pitting the criminal with a fully-loaded magazine against the law-abiding citizen limited to seven rounds. ... The seven-round limit thus carries a much stronger possibility of disproportionately affecting law-abiding citizens.</blockquote>Although celebrating the "partial victory," guns rights organizations are expected to appeal.

<p>Several states have enacted new gun control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting, many of which have also faced challenges and lawsuits from advocacy groups. Last month, a federal judge in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-dismisses-connecticut-gun-control-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Connecticut's new gun-control law. Connecticut's new measure was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law in April and is considered one of the most far-reaching gun-control laws in the country. The law added over 100 new weapons to the list of banned assault firearms and creates the nation's first database of dangerous weapon offenders. A day later Maryland also <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a new firearms law, imposing stricter requirements to obtain a license for certain types of firearms. In May Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against their state's two new gun-control laws, also enacted early in 2013. Those laws also included magazine capacity limits and increased scrutiny over those purchasing firearms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge John Koeltl <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-approves-release-of-former-civil-rights-lawyer.php">granted the motion</a> [JURIST report] after it was filed Tuesday, finding that Stewart's terminal health condition qualified her for "compassionate release." Stewart was <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TERROR_TRIAL_LAWYER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2013-12-31-23-47-04">released</a> [AP report] from Federal Medical Center Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, and arrived in New York Wednesday afternoon, where she was greeted by supporters and relatives. Stewart was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-lawyer-convicted-of.php">convicted by a jury in 2005</a> [JURIST report] on charges of conspiracy, giving material support to terrorists and defrauding the US government for smuggling messages from convicted terrorist <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/923/000099626/">Omar Abdel-Rahman</a> [NNBD profile] to members of his militant organization, <a href="http://cns.miis.edu/archive/wtc01/algamaa.htm">Islamic Group</a> [CNS backgrounder].

The Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/second-circuit-affirms-civil-rights.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] Stewart's conviction in 2009 but ordered the district court to reconsider her sentence, finding that the current 28-month sentence was "out of line with the extreme seriousness of her criminal conduct."

Abdus Subhan, who was arrested last September, was formally charged after Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICTB) conducted an investigation. However, human rights groups say that the tribunal, which was set up in 2010 to investigate abuses committed in that war, does not meet international standards and supporters of the Islamist party <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website; Global Security <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">backgrounder</a>] say the tribunal is used politically <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25557101">to eradicate its leaders</a> [BBC report]. The Bangladesh war of independence caused an estimated 10 million civilians to flee to India, and an estimated 3 million deaths. Subhan has denied all charges. 

<p>The war crimes tribunal has led to increased unrest and clashes between protestors and security forces throughout the nation. Last month the Bangladesh government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/bangladesh-executes-islamist-leader-for-crimes-during-1971-war-for-independence.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] Jamaat-e-Islami Assistant Secretary General <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdul+Quader+Mollah">Abdul Quader Mullah</a> [JURIST news archive] for war crimes during the war of liberation. Also in December, two UN human rights experts on <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-halt-execution.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Bangladesh government to halt the execution of Mullah, advocating that the right of appeal is particularly important in death penalty cases, separating "possibly permitted" capital punishment from summary execution, "which by definition violates human rights standards." In August <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/bangladesh-security-forces-abusing-protesters-hrw.php">report</a> [JURIST report] documenting brutality by Bangladeshi security forces in responding to street protests, resulting in the death of at least 150 protesters and the injury of at least 2,000 since February. HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-bangladesh-and-jamaat-e-islaami-must-encourage-end-to-recent-violence.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to JI in March to end violent protests and clashes between the group's supporters and Bangladeshi police, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21639831">which resulted in at least 46 deaths</a> [BBC report] that month alone. Appeals to members of JI to respect the rule of law and engage in peaceful exchange have been made particularly difficult by an August ruling by a Bangladeshi high court declaring the organization an <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/bangladesh-court-rules-jamaat-e-islami-is-illegal-political-party.php">illegal political party</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court admitted Sergio Garcia based on a new California <a href="http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/asm/ab_1001-1050/ab_1024_bill_20131005_chaptered.pdf">statute</a> [Business and Professions Code section 6064, PDF] which grants the court discretion to admit any individual "who is not lawfully present in the United States" that fulfills all the requirements for admission. Garcia, who was born in Mexico and brought to the US almost 20 years ago is eligible to adjust his immigration status to attain lawful permanent resident when an immigration visa number becomes available. However, he is still waiting for adjustment due to the high demand for visas for Mexican citizens. The court specifically noted:<blockquote>In light of the recently enacted state legislation, we conclude that the Committee's motion to admit Garcia to the State Bar should be granted. The new legislation removes any potential statutory obstacle to Garcia's admission posed by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1621">section 1621</a> [text], and there is no other federal statute that purports to preclude a state from granting a license to practice law to an undocumented immigrant. The new statute also reflects that the Legislature and the Governor have concluded that the admission of an undocumented immigrant who has met all the qualifications for admission to the State Bar is fully consistent with this state's public policy, and, as this opinion explains, we find no basis to disagree with that conclusion. Finally, we agree with the Committee's determination that Garcia possesses the requisite good moral character to warrant admission to the State Bar and, pursuant to our constitutional authority, grant the Committee's motion to admit Garcia to the State Bar.</blockquote>Critics claim that this ruling sets a dangerous precedent as well as raise the potential contradiction in admitting an individuation not lawfully in the US to uphold the law as a part of the state bar. Supporters of the ruling, however, argue that it is a step in the right direction by granting increased rights to those undocumented immigrants who are otherwise successful and contributing members of the community.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">US immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a controversial issue, especially in dealing with undocumented immigrants. Last month New Jersey governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing undocumented immigrants to claim in-state tuition. In November the mayor of Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/dc-mayor-signs-bill-allowing-drivers-licenses-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill allowing driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.

In March a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">permanently blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US government filed a <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/13a691-little-sisters-injunction-opp.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] Friday asking the US <a href="http://supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to remove the <a href="http://howappealing.law.com/13A691-LittleSistersVsSebeliusStayOrder.pdf">stay</a> [text, PDF] on the contraception mandate in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] that was put in place by Justice Sonia Sotomayor earlier this week. The government argues that the motion for an emergency injunction filed by <a href="http://www.littlesistersofthepoor.org/">Little Sisters For the Poor</a> [advocacy website] was granted improperly because the group has no legal basis, as an exempted "church plan," to file the lawsuit. Sotomayor's injunction applies to the Little Sisters as well as several other religious groups that use the same health plan. In the initial grant of the injunction, she noted she would revisit the issue after receiving the government's response. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/meet-osg.html">Solicitor General Donald Verrilli</a> [official profile] noted in his response:<blockquote>[Applicants] need only self-certify that they are non-profit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and have religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services, and then provide a copy of their self-certification to the third-party administrator of their self-insured group health plan. At that point, the employer-applicants will have satisfied all their obligations under the contraceptive coverage provision. Thus, as this case comes to the Court, it is not about the availability or adequacy of a religious accommodation, but rather about whether a religious objector can invoke RFRA to justify its refusal to sign a self-certification that secures the very religion-based exemption the objector seeks. Applicants have no legal basis to challenge the selfcertification requirement or to complain that it involves them in the process of providing contraceptive coverage. As both of the lower courts recognized, this case involves a church plan that is exempt from regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).</blockquote>Non-profit groups seeking these types of exemptions claim that this certification process is a violation in itself. Sotomayor, who is in charge of emergency motions arising out of the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] will issue a ruling on the injunction. 

<p>The contraception has been a subject of legal uncertainty since the PPACA was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report]. Sotomayor <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-justice-blocks-contraception-mandate-in-lawsuit.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the initial emergency injunction earlier this week. In September, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/obama-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-review-contraception-mandate.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court for a writ of <em>certiorari</em> to review the constitutionality of the mandate. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/09.17.13_opinion_affirming_denial_of_pi.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Autocam Corp., a manufacturer of car and medical supplies, must comply with the PPACA's contraception coverage mandate. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that family-owned, profit-making businesses cannot challenge the new federal health care law's birth control mandate on religious grounds. The previous month, however, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Hobby Lobby may challenge the mandate on religious grounds.

A Maoist-led government <a href="http://www.enca.com/world/nepals-court-rules-out-amnesty-serious-war-crimes">proposed</a> [Enca report] the legislation last year as part of a planned <a href="http://www.simonrobins.com/missing/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Nepal-TRC-Ordinance.pdf">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> [text, PDF] aimed at healing the wounds from the civil war. Justices <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.np/pages/cv_justices/cv_kalyansh.html">Kalyan Shrestha</a>, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.np/pages/cv_justices/cv_girisclal.html">Girish Chandra Lal</a> and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.np/pages/cv_justices/cv_sushilakarki.html">Sushila Karki</a> [official websites] said the government must <a href="http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=67287">amend</a> [Nepal Republica report] the amnesty provisions in Section 25 and 29 to make the Truth and Reconciliation Commission legislation compatible with international standards. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.np/main.php?d=messages&f=chief">court</a> [official website, in Nepali] ruled that the ordinance fails to guarantee that there will be no blanket amnesty for perpetrators of serious human rights violations. In April 2013, Justice Karki stayed the implementation of the ordinance ruling that it contradicted <a href="http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Nepal_Interim_Constitution2007.pdf">Nepal's Interim Constitution</a> [text, PDF] formed in 2007. 

<p>In March UN High Commissioner of Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for Nepal to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-nepal-must-withdraw-civil-war-commissions-amnesty-power.php">withdraw</a> [JURIST report] the power to grant amnesty for human rights violations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ordinance. In January of last year the <a href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> (ICJ) [official website] called on the Nepal government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icj-urges-nepal-government-to-cooperate-with-uk-in-torture-investigation.php">cooperate with an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations leveled against Nepal Army Colonel Kumar Lama who is charged with two counts of torture during Nepal's civil war. In October 2012 the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/NP/OHCHR_Nepal_Conflict_Report2012.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">urging justice for victims of international law violations</a> [JURIST report] that occurred during Nepal's civil war.

On Friday a judge in Diyarbakir ordered the release of Gulser Yildirim and Ibrahim Ayhan who were charged with supporting the <a href="http://www.pkkonline.com/en/">Kurdistan Worker's Party</a> (PKK) [party website] rebels and had been detained since 2010. This decision came after a Turkish court in Diyarbakir <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-court-rejects-release-of-detained-kurdish-lawmakers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Yildirim and Ayhan's release in December 2013.

The respondents argue that the state must meet an "especially high burden," because it is asking that a circuit justice grant a stay of the district court's judgment pending appeal to the court of appeals, when the court of appeals itself has refused to issue the stay. Respondents argue that the state's rights will not be seriously and irreparably injured by denial of a stay:<blockquote>Complying with the injunction requires no change in the existing legal structure or administration of civil marriage, and the evidence before this Court shows that, like other states which have implemented similar rulings, Utah can readily and effectively comply with the District Court's order.</blockquote>The respondents challenge the state's argument that the high court should issue a stay because same-sex couples and their children may suffer "dignitary and financial losses," should the state win on appeal, contending that "[a]pplicants cannot simultaneously concede that being stripped of one's marital status causes profound, irreparable harm and urge the Court to inflict that very injury on the married Respondents and other married same-sex couples."

<p>The rights of same-sex couples has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. Last month the US District Court for the District of Utah ruled that Utah's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The same day that the Utah ruling was issued, the Uganda parliament passed a bill limiting the rights of same-sex couples and imposing a penalty of up to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">life imprisonment </a> [JURIST report] for involvement in homosexual relationships. Earlier that week, New Mexico's high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/new-mexico-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">ruled that it is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. The same week, the US executive branch announced that it would begin <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/12/obama-administration-to-begin-processing-social-security-payments-to-same-sex-couples.php">processing Social Security payments</a> [JURIST report] to surviving couples in accordance with a US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] issued this summer which struck down the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text], a federal statute that defined marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes and refused to recognize any other type of marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In December Judge Richard Leon granted in part the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, but he stayed his order pending appeal. The DOJ has asked the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/internet/appellate/main.jsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] to reconsider the lower court opinion.

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy.

The Islamist-led party and secular parties <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/03/us-tunisia-constitution-idUSBREA020F020140103">overcame</a> [Reuters report] intense debate about Islam's role in the country before beginning to draft the new constitution. The National Constituent Assembly <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/01/05/tunisia-mps-reject-islam-law">adopted</a> [SBS report] only 12 of the proposed 146 articles despite a January 14 deadline for the completion of the new constitution. The first clause of the constitution says Tunisia is "a free country, independent, with sovereignty; Islam is its religion, Arabic its language and the republic its regime." However, Article 6 makes the state the "guardian of religion", "protector of the sacred" and guarantor of "freedom of conscience". The <a href="http://www.ministeres.tn/">Tunisian government</a> [official website, in Arabic] employed heavy security in the capital Tunis during the parliament assembly to deter attacks from radical Islamists opposed to the adoption of the new constitution in place of Islam law.

<p>Tunisia has faced political turmoil since president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-assassination-of-tunisian-opposition-leader.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the assassination of Tunisian opposition leader. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-tunisia-should-modify-draft-constitution-to-protect-human-rights.php">modify its draft constitution</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protection of human rights. Two months earlier HRW urged Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-tunisia-to-repeal-criminal-defamation-law.php">repeal its criminal defamation law</a> [JURIST report], which is typically considered a civil offense throughout the world. That same month Tunisian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/tunisia-lawmakers-vote-on-timetable-for-constitution-and-elections.php">voted to approve</a> [JURIST report] a timetable for its draft constitution and national elections. Last October, HRW called on Tunisian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-human-rights-watch-advocacy-2.php">investigate a series of attacks</a> [JURIST report] by religious extremists and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The classified memo was issued by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> (OLC) [official website] in January 2010. The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/us/court-backs-shielding-of-legal-memo-on-phone-records.html?_r=0">denies</a> [NYT report] that it ever employed the legal theory in the classified memo and claimed that it never planned to. The appeals court found that the memo was an "advisory opinion, recommendation and deliberation comprising part of a process by which government decisions and policies are formulated." The court found, therefore, that the memo was covered by the deliberative process privilege making it exempt from disclosure under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text]. Legal specialists have found the ruling to be consistent with how other federal courts have handled OLC memos recently. 

<p>The revelations surrounding NSA surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In December the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/order_granting_governments_motion_to_dismiss_and_denying_aclu_motion_for_preliminary_injunction.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency's</a> (NSA) [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/2013/07/prism.php">PRISM</a> [JURIST backgrounder] program is legal. Also in December, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-releases-documents-on-nsa-surveillance-origins.php">US released documents</a> [JURIST report] concerning the origins of NSA surveillance. In September the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a previously classified <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/791759/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] explaining why a NSA program to keep records of Americans' phone calls is constitutional.

The release was reportedly <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rights-group-cambodia-police-hold-activists-21430791">conditioned upon the demonstrators' collective agreement</a> [AP report] that they would not join in recent labor rallies aimed, in part, toward offsetting the power of Prime Minister Hun Sen and furthering the rights of garment workers. Cambodian authorities on Saturday formally banned public protest in the capital city of Phnom Penh and forced demonstrators to disperse after a Friday rally resulted in clashes with security forces and four civilian deaths. Surya Subedi, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, <a href="https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46869&Cr=protest&Cr1=#.UsrGC3lvBg0">urged</a> [press release] Cambodian authorities to use restraint when dealing with protestors and encouraged a peaceful resolution to the nation's labor problems.

<p>Labor rights continue to be a contentious issue across the globe. In November Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a letter to the Labor Minister of Morocco, Abdeslam Seddiki, imploring the Moroccan government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/hrw-moroccan-parliament-should-revise-labor-law-to-comply-with-international-standards.php">revise a draft law</a> [JURIST report] before the Moroccan parliament, regarding legal protections for domestic workers, to comply with international standards. Also in November Amnesty International reported that Vietnamese authorities are <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ai-accuses-vietnam-of-repressive-laws.php">using repressive laws</a> [JURIST report], unfair trials and harsh prison conditions against activists who oppose the ruling Communist government. The report claimed that those arrested include bloggers, labor and land rights activists, human rights defenders, and religious followers. In September Portugal's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/portugal-high-court-strikes-down-private-business-firing-austerity-measure.php">struck down an austerity measure</a> [JURIST report] that gave private companies greater latitude to fire employees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The demand came after the former president <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/655477/islamabad-court-rejects-petition-seeking-ban-on-musharrafs-exit-from-pakistan/">missed another hearing</a> [</em>Express News</em> report] complaining of chest pain. Prosecutor Akram Sheikh has accused Musharraf of checking into the Rawalpindi hospital to miss hearings rather than to address actual health concerns. Sheikh <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/produce-musharraf-medical-report-on-tuesday-special-court/article5544867.ece">demanded</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] that non-bailable warrants be issued against him but the court refused, calling the action inappropriate. A <a href="http://pktimes.4com.co/tag/musharrafs">petition</a> [<em>Pakistan Times</em> report] filed by the Shuhada Foundation seeking to ban Musharraf from leaving the country for medical treatment was also rejected, though the former leader remains on the country's Exit Control List and cannot leave Pakistan without court approval.

<p>Musharraf has faced a slew of legal troubles. In December the Islamabad High Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/pakistan-court-rules-treason-trial-against-musharraf-will-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the former president's trial for treason would continue despite Musharraf's challenges to the legitimacy of the proceedings. Earlier that month he was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-pakistan-president-musharraf-granted-bail-in-red-mosque-killings-case.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] in a criminal case relating to the death of a radical cleric. In August the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. Also that month a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">officially charged</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of Benazir Bhutto.

Authorities first moved Woodfox to isolation in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola and later to "closed-cell restriction" at state jails. Later this month, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] is set to determine in a appeal lodged by the state of Louisiana whether a February district court decision, which overturned Woodfox's conviction, was correctly decided. Tessa Murphy of AI decried Woodfox's treatment Monday, stating: <blockquote>The state of Louisiana's action is not in the interests of justice. Its insistence in keeping Albert Woodfox behind bars after decades in solitary confinement amounts to a campaign of vengeance, paid with taxpayers' money. ... Louisiana should withdraw its legal appeal and allow the federal court ruling to stand. Should this not occur, the Court of Appeal should rule in the interests of justice and pave the way for Albert Woodfox's release.</blockquote>According to reports, Woodfox typically spends 23 hours a day in solitary confinement in a cell approximately 8 feet by 12 feet.

<p>The legality of solitary confinement has been an ongoing debate in the US. In October UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-us-to-release-prisoner-from-indefinite-solitary-confinement.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to immediately end the solitary confinement imposed in 1972 on Woodcox. In September Mendez stated in a report to the UN General Assembly that governments should <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/governments-torture-expert-condemns-solitary-confinement-for-juveniles-mentally-disabled.php">ban solitary confinement</a> [JURIST report] for juveniles and prisoners with mental disabilities. Mendez told the assembly members that governments should impose solitary confinement only in exceptional circumstances and for short periods of time. In June at least 400 inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison in California <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/california-inmates-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-solitary-confinement.php">initiated a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in protest of solitary confinement. Inmates of Pelican Bay's Security Housing Unit (SHU), a long-term isolation ward where one-third of the prison's population is held in solitary confinement, are the instigators of the strike, and most of the strikers from other prisons are inmates in solitary confinement. In January 2011 the Washington Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that holding death row inmates in solitary confinement indefinitely is <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/washington-supreme-court-upholds-indefinite-solitary-confinement-for-death-row-prisoners.php">not an impermissible increase</a> [JURIST report] in the severity of punishment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The fee cuts, which would reduce their pay by <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-06/u-k-trial-lawyers-stage-first-walkout-in-600-years-on-fee-cuts.html">as much as 30 percent</a> [Bloomberg report], are part of an attempt by the government to lessen the country's deficit. Lawyers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25597617">refused to attend court</a> [BBC report] before 2:00 PM in cities including London, Manchester, Bristol and Cardiff as part of a walkout organized by the <a href="https://www.criminalbar.com/">Criminal Bar Association</a> [official website]. <a href="http://www.chambersandpartners.com/person/230416/14">Mugul Chawla</a>, QC [official profile], reading a statement on behalf of the south-eastern circuit, said that the cuts would lead to more guilty parties going unpunished and more innocent parties being wrongfully convicted as more defendants end up representing themselves. He went on to say that a number of high profile, white-collar fraud cases were in danger of going to court without representation for defendants. The impact of the cuts can already be seen in the UK's biggest insider trading investigation, Operation Tabernula, where only two of the six defendants have trial lawyers. Other protesters <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jan/06/courts-close-england-wales-lawyers-legal-aid-cuts">voiced concerns</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that the cuts would leave people financially unable to join the criminal bar and limit access to legal aid to those who could afford it. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Justice stated that at about two billion pounds a year, the UK has one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, and that that system would remain generous after reform as well. She also expressed her belief that the government's proposals would allow lawyers to be paid fairly for their work. 

<p>Lawyers and legal organizations alike have responded critically to the fee cuts since their proposal. In June, the UK Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent public body that investigates miscarriages of justice, warned that the government's proposed changes to legal aid could increase the likelihood of convictions of vulnerable or mentally ill suspects. Earlier that month the <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/">Law Society</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/law-society-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">described</a> [press release] the proposals as "unworkable" and likely to cause "catastrophic" damage to the UK's legal aid system. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/">Bar Council</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media-centre/news-and-press-releases/2013/june/bar-council-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">criticism</a> [press release] of Grayling's proposals, claiming that the Ministry of Justice "failed to consider hard evidence" and that the proposals are "a breathtakingly convoluted way of finding ... savings." In a letter to <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/">The Times</a> [media website] on May 7, nine leading legal academics from six of the UK's top universities <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/leading-academics-warn-legal-aid-cuts-could-have-devastating-effects/">set out their concerns</a> [press release] that the government's plan to cut criminal legal aid and introduce a system of tendering based on price could have devastating and irreversible consequences, making access to justice available only to those who can afford it and abandoning the professional lawyer-client relationship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay declared the decision to be a "significant development" for the victims of the war, which lasted from 1996 to 2006 and claimed at least 13,000 lives, with another 1,300 going missing during the conflict. She stressed that Nepal would need to do more work to correct issues, such as the criminal justice system and other aspects of Nepalese law, that lead to continued violations of human rights. Pillay added: "I now call on the Government of Nepal to urgently implement this important decision, in the spirit of working towards genuine and lasting peace, and to respect the demand of the Nepalese people for justice."  The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] is prepared to provide support and guidance to Nepal's government during the reform.

<p>In March Pillay called for Nepal to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-nepal-must-withdraw-civil-war-commissions-amnesty-power.php">withdraw</a> [JURIST report] the power to grant amnesty for human rights violations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ordinance.

In October 2012 the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-justice-for-nepal-civil-war-crimes.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] urging justice for victims of international law violations that occurred during Nepal's civil war.

The <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/">Utah Attorney General</a> [official website] filed an <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/12/Application-for-Stay.pdf">application for stay</a> [text, PDF] with the court last week to block same-sex marriages pending the state's appeal of a US district judge's December 20 <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] striking down the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. Three similar applications to the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] have already been <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rejects-Utah-state-request-to-block-same-sex-marriages.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report]. In the application for stay, the attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the district court's decision to strike down the ban on same-sex marriage is an "impermissible federal intrusion on state power" to define marriage. Meanwhile, supporters of same-sex marriage urged the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriage-supporters-urge-supreme-court-to-reject-stay-request.php">reject the request to stay</a> [JURIST report] the district court's ruling. The court responded with a brief order to stay the ruling pending expedited review by the appellate court but offered no word on the constitutionality of the issue. While the Supreme Court's ruling puts a hold on same-sex marriages in Utah only, the upcoming Tenth Circuit decision could have an affect on all states within its jurisdiction.

<p>Same-sex marriage has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. Last month the US District Court for the District of Utah ruled that Utah's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The same day that the Utah ruling was issued, the Uganda parliament passed a bill limiting the rights of same-sex couples and imposing a penalty of up to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for involvement in homosexual relationships.

While LaRose, who converted to Islam online, did not ultimately carry out the terrorist plot, she was arrested in 2009 and eventually <a href="/test_blog/2011/02/pennsylvania-woman-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to all charges. During sentencing, the prosecution urged the court to give LaRose decades behind bars, arguing that she was still very much a danger to society. Meanwhile, her defense painted LaRose as a vulnerable and manipulated woman, emphasizing the fact that she never actually carried out the bungled plot. Since her arrest, she has cooperated with authorities and provided valuable information about other terrorist threats. LaRose has been in prison for four years already, and will be given credit for time already served. Upon her release from prison, she will spend five years on supervised release.

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda-linked plots are making their way through the US judicial system. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in November <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-terrorism-conviction-for-aiding-al-qaeda.php">upheld the 2011 conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Tarek Mehanna, who was found guilty on four terror-related charges and three charges of lying to authorities. In October <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/chief-guantanamo-prosecutor-agrees-to-try-al-qaeda-conspirator-in-federal-court.php">suspected terrorist Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai</a> [JURIST report] was charged in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York [official website]. In March Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, the son-in-law of Osama Bin Laden, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] and thereafter indicted in federal court for plotting to kill Americans. In January the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">vacated the conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, Osama bin Laden's media secretary. In October 2012 Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges. His charges included taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, and conspiring to do such acts. He made his first appearance in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York after being extradited from the UK. Osama Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed </a>[JURIST report] by US military personnel in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government had made employer contributions to health insurance plans prior to the enactment of the PPACA, and OPM extended that support even when those people purchased coverage through the PPACA's online marketplace. Johnson <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/06/us-usa-healthcare-lawsuit-idUSBREA050JI20140106">claims</a> [Reuters report] this decision permits Congress members and their staffs to enjoy "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304325004579296140856419808">special treatment</a>" [Johnson's WSJ op-ed] that ordinary Americans do not receive, and was an overstepping of OPM's authority. Johnson also held a press conference about the lawsuit on Monday.

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PLB-FBG5puQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>US Representative <a href="http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/">James Sensenbrenner</a> (R-WI) [official website] <a href="http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=365375">criticized</a> [press release] Johnson's lawsuit as an "unfortunate political stunt" and referred to the lawsuit as "frivolous," to which Johnson <a href="http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=30ca7871-9b02-4c08-bf7b-25bd9a317e46">responded</a> [press release] that the lawsuit is "an issue of basic fairness that I believe is worth fighting for."</p>

<p>Johnson's challenge is one of the latest developments and one of several <a href="/hotline/2012/04/sekulow-white-health-care.php">criticisms</a> [JURIST op-ed] concerning the PPACA. On Friday the US government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-government-asks-supreme-court-to-lift-stay-on-contraception-mandate.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] asking the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to remove the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-justice-blocks-contraception-mandate-in-lawsuit.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] on the contraception mandate in the PPACA that was put in place by Justice Sonia Sotomayor earlier that week. Last December the Supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-challenge-to-health-care-employer-mandate.php">refused to hear</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/liberty-university-v-lew/">challenge</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [official website] to the PPACA mandate requiring employers to provide affordable health insurance for their employees. In June the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Treasury</a> (DOT) [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/treasury-department-delays-ppaca-employer-mandate.php">delay enforcing</a> [JURIST report] the PPACA employer mandate for businesses with 50 or more full-time employees until 2015. The Supreme Court ruled last year that the "<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">individual mandate</a>" [text] provision of the act, which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">did not violate the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The PPACA was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in March 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hHRdxpAK2nMsELgF-pwh8Y7oqGYg?docId=7d79f5f8-d0e7-46be-8466-c532f725ed5d">submitted a declaration</a> [AFP report] to the ICC accepting its jurisdiction over Egypt.

<p>In December, 139 Morsi supporters were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-court-sentences-139-protesters-in-mass-trial.php">sentenced to two year prison terms</a> [JURIST report] on a variety of charges including rioting and sabotage during a July 15 protest demanding Morsi's reinstatement.

Pro-choice groups contend that the district court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-strikes-down-restrictive-texas-abortion-law.php">correctly ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the provisions of the law restricting the use of abortifacients and requiring abortion-proving physicians to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital place an unconstitutional burden on women's access to abortion. However, the state <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/06/texas-abortion-law/4339335/">argues</a> [AP report] that the provisions are necessary to advance the state's "interest in protecting fetal life," and for the welfare of women seeking abortions.

<p>Texas has been at the center of the ongoing controversy over <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In November, the US Supreme Court ruled to allow Texas's abortion law to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-allows-texas-abortion-law-to-remain-in-effect.php">remain in effect</a> [JURIST report] while the Fifth Circuit evaluates the trial court's ruling. Earlier that month, abortion rights groups such as <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/abortion-rights-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-halt-texas-law.php">filed an emergency request</a> asking the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-strikes-down-restrictive-texas-abortion-law.php">reinstate a previous injunction</a> [JURIST reports] blocking HB 2. In its brief,Texas defended the admitting privileges requirement, saying that it would promote women's health by "fostering a woman's ability to seek consultation and treatment for complications directly from her physician."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] and state <a href="https://www.azag.gov">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official website] are named as defendants in the lawsuit. Two of the four couples in the complaint were married legally in California, and two of the couples have adopted children. In 2003 the Arizona Court of Appeals upheld Arizona's statutory definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and in 2008 voters in the state <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] ballot amendment <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/election/2008/info/pubpamphlet/english/prop102.htm">Proposition 102</a> [ballot description] to the state's constitution by a vote of 56-44 percent. The constitutional amendment precludes an Arizona court from overruling the state statute, and only a federal court ruling could overrule the constitution. The claimants' attorney, Shawn Aiken, believes now is the appropriate time to challenge the state of Arizona to recognize same-sex marriage. 

<p>The debate over <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community. Two of Arizona's neighboring states, Utah and New Mexico, addressed the issue in recent weeks, and on Monday the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in Utah was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocked</a> by the US Supreme Court after the Utah AG <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">filed an application for stay</a> [JURIST reports] with the court in the previous week. The AG's petition to the Supreme Court followed action in the US District Court for the District of Utah, where a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rejects-Utah-state-request-to-block-same-sex-marriages.php">rejected the requests</a> from several lawyers to block the passing of same-sex marriage in the state after Utah's ban on same-sex marriage was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overturned</a> [JURIST reports] in district court on December 20. One day prior to the ruling which allowed same-sex marriage in Utah, the state of New Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/new-mexico-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In response to a 2010 lawsuit challenging the ordinance, the decision allows licensed firearms dealers to operate within the city and firearm owners to lawfully transfer ownership of their guns. US District Judge Edmond Chang found the city's arguments for retaining the ban unpersuasive and that it would not support its stated purpose of reducing gun violence. In his 35-page opinion, Chang wrote:<blockquote>Chicago's ordinance goes too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions and lawful sales of firearms, and at the same time the evidence does not support that the complete ban sufficiently furthers the purposes the ordinance tries to serve.</blockquote>The ruling has been temporarily stayed to allow the city to appeal the decision.

<p>Gun control has been a controversial topic in Illinois, especially in Chicago where lawmakers have attempted to curb endemic gun violence without infringing on the rights of legal firearms owners. The <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] in September <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/the-illinois-supreme-court-official.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] provisions of the state's "aggravated weapon use law" as unconstitutional. In August Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] signed a law <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/illinois-governor-signs-gun-control-bill-into-law.php">expanding background check requirements</a> [JURIST report] to include private transactions of firearms as well as purchases from licensed dealers and requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. The Illinois legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/illinois-lawmakers-pass-concealed-weapons-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] in July allowing residents to apply for concealed carry permits, making Illinois the last state to approve some form of concealed weapon permits. A federal judge with the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/">Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-chicago-gun-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Chicago's firearms ordinance in June 2012 for being unconstitutionally vague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill in question would make Thailand's upper house of Parliament an all-elected body. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/thai-anti-graft-body-308-mps-acted-illegally-21445170">ruling</a> [AP report] will result in further investigation of the member's actions and could reportedly result in their being banned from politics in the future. The Commission did not provide an explanation for its decision, but a prior Thai Constitutional Court ruling held that the lawmakers acted illegally by violating legislative procedures in a way that upset the nation's system of checks and balances of power. Some fear that this ruling will further destabilize Thai politics during the current power struggle between supporters and detractors of the government. 

<p>Thai politics have been in a contentious state since the ousting of former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder] by a <a href="/forum/2006/09/disillusioned-with-democracy-tale-of.php">military coup</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2006. In December Thai officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/thailand-refuses-to-delay-election-despite-violent-protests.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] calls to postpone the upcoming February elections but protesters have continued to advocate for a delay and have stepped up their demonstrations in response to this latest ruling by the NACC. In November Thailand's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-high-court-refuses-to-allow-ruling-party-to-amend-constitution.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] the proposal to amend the nation's constitution illegal and that many legislators had acted illegally in trying to force its passing. The NACC's ruling on the conduct of the legislators themselves is the latest culmination on the issue. Thai opposition groups have <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-protesters-seek-help-overthrowing-government.php">sought help</a> [JURIST report] in trying to overthrow the current government and it is yet unclear what effect this ruling affecting 308 pro-government legislators will have on their success in doing so. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontroberts.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Chief Justice John Roberts of the US Supreme Court on Monday refused to grant a temporary injunction blocking the Obama administration from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), denying two doctor's groups' plea arguing the entire law is unconstitutional due to the method of its passing. The plea, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/01/plea-to-block-health-care-law-denied/#more-203198">brought</a> [SCOTUSblog report] by the American Physician's group and the Alliance for National Health USA, is a broad constitutional rejoinder to the Supreme Court's previous ruling finding the PPACA mandate constitutional. That decision found the law legal as a type of tax which the federal government has the authority to issue; the rejoinder uses this characterization to claim that as a tax measure the bill is subject to the Constitution's Origination Clause, which requires such measures to originate in the House of Representatives. The plea claimed that the bill actually originated in the Senate, which essentially crowded the PPACA into a prior and unrelated House bill and thereby sidestepped the origination issue. Roberts issued no opinion and made no comments about his decision to deny to plea, merely refusing to grant the injunction pending a decision on the case in a federal district court. 

<p>The PPACA, its enforcement, and all the attendant <a href="/forum/2010/04/is-health-care-reform-constitutional.php">constitutional issues</a> [JURIST Forum] have been major political issues over the last several years, prompting a multitude of court challenges and opinions by many different legal scholars on both sides. In October another physicians group, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/health-care-law-faces-new-challenge.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of revisions to the law's employer mandate, claiming the revisions are an illegal executive rewriting of the law. Earlier that month Alabama's Attorney General, along with a Roman Catholic broadcasting network <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/alabama-files-new-lawsuit-over-us-health-care-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the ACA on the ground that it requires employers to include coverage for <a href="/forum/2013/11/ruthann-robson-puzzling-corporations.php">contraception</a> [JURIST Forum] and abortion-related drugs in their healthcare plans. In September 2013 the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-house-passes-federal-funding-bill-proposing-to-defund-affordable-care-act.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a federal funding bill containing provisions aimed at defunding the ACA, one of consistently used methods of attacking the legislation. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] its ruling accepting the governments characterization of the Act as a <a href="/forum/2012/07/sallie-sanford-scotus-aca.php">tax</a> [JURIST Forum] and declaring it constitutional in June 2012. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A criminal complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charging JP Morgan with two violations of the <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/">Bank Secrecy Act</a> [federal backgrounder], which requires US financial institutions to assist US. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. The first charge against JP Morgan is a failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, and the second charge is a failure to file a suspicious activity report to the authorities. This payment is the largest penalty ever imposed for a violation of anti-money laundering laws by the US Department of Justice. The agreement includes an obligation on behalf of JP Morgan to acknowledge the findings in the criminal investigations, cooperate in future investigations, and improve the bank's monitoring and compliance procedures. 

<p>Legal action continues from the fallout of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">2008 Madoff Ponzi scheme</a> [JURIST news archive], which defrauded investors of approximately $65 billion. Madoff held the majority of his firm's assets in accounts at JP Morgan and it is unlikely the deferred prosecution agreement will mark the end of the the bank's legal involvement in the case. The US Supreme Court is scheduled to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/picard-v-jpmorgan-chase-co/">hold a conference</a> [SCOTUS Blog] on Friday to discuss a pending petition brought from Irving Picard, the court appointed trustee in charge of the <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/facts-08.html">madoff recovery initiative</a> [trustee website], against JP Morgan. In September a judge for the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/madoff-victims-not-entitled-to-interest-bankruptcy-judge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that victims can only recover the principal amount invested without accounting for inflation over the past five years and excluding interest. Last April a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-madoff-victims-suit-against-sec.php">rejected a suit</a> [JURIST report] by victims against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thousands of ethnic Rohingya fleeing abuse in <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21565638-why-buddhists-and-muslims-rakhine-state-myanmar-are-each-others%E2%80%99-throats-unforgiving">Rakhine state</a> [Economist backgrounder] enter Thailand seeking asylum. According to HRW, Thailand's "help on" policy of intercepting small boats carrying Rohingya has been <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/20/thailand-release-and-protect-rohingya-boat-people">abused</a> [press release], with the Thai navy either pushing ill-equipped boats of asylum seekers out to sea, or giving the Royingya to people smugglers who promise to send the Rohingya onwards for a high price, and hand over those unable to pay to human traffickers. HRW further alleges that Thailand's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/06/thailand-protect-rohingya-boat-children">indefinite detention of Rohingya children</a> [HRW report] and prohibition on educating those children in immigration detention centers violates its obligations under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text].

<p><a href="/feature/featured/human-trafficking/">Human trafficking</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is an international issue plaguing countries all over the world. In October, UN rights experts, the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/Docs/Monitoring/GRETA_en.asp">Council of Europe</a> (COE) and the <a href="http://www.osce.org/cthb">Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official websites] jointly issued a statement <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/international-human-rights-groups-call-for-concerted-global-response-to-fight-human-trafficking.php">calling for global cooperation</a> [JURIST report] in the fight against the transnational trafficking of persons. The joint statement follows a report filed by the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons in June urging the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-expert-urges-focus-on-victims-of-human-trafficking.php">focus on the human rights of trafficked individuals</a> when criminalizing and prosecuting human trafficking as well as a statement by the European Commission regarding its <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-adopts-plan-to-end-human-trafficking.php">plans to end human trafficking in Europe</a> [JURIST reports]. Human trafficking is "a multi-billion dollar industry which has trapped some 21 million men, women and children in forced labor," and occurs across the globe but is <a href="/feature/2013/07/international-efforts-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">most prevalent</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in regions of conflict.

The attack resulted in the establishment of an investigation committee by Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was welcomed by the OHCHR. Various UN human rights experts <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46879&Cr=yemen&Cr1=#.UsyGCiinVgI">voiced concern</a> [UN News Centre report] only a day before the December 27 drone strike regarding earlier drone airstrikes that were allegedly conducted by US forces in Yemen. In its statement, the OHCHR urged Yemeni officials to conduct a prompt investigation and to hold those responsible for the drone strike accountable for the deaths and injuries incurred during the attack. The OHCHR has also stated that it will remain in contact with Yemeni officials during the investigation. 

<p>The growing use of drones has drawn the attention of the world and become a <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">controversial topic</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent months. In October of last year two UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-accountability-transparency-in-use-of-drones.php">issued separate reports</a> [JURIST report] to the UN General Assembly calling upon states to increase transparency in the use of drones and to investigate allegations of civilian deaths in drone strikes. Also in October, a report made public by the UN indicated that the US is <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-report-claims-us-drone-strikes-have-killed-more-than-publicly-stated.php">under-reporting the number of civilian deaths</a> [JURIST report] resulting from anti-terrorism drone strikes. In his investigation, UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson discovered 33 drone attacks that have resulted in approximately 450 civilian deaths in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen. This report was made available to the public days after police in Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/local-officials-report-five-afghanistan-civilians-killed-in-nato-airstrike.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] the death of five civilians from a <a href="http://www.nato.int/">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] counter-terrorism drone strike headed by the US.

McGuire's execution was scheduled for January 16 after being <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/07/ohio-execution-untried-drugs/4360235/">found guilty</a> [AP report] of the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart. A shortage of Ohio's former execution drug, pentobarbital, has forced a switch to midazolam, a sedative, combined with hydromorphone, a painkiller, which, according to McGuire's attorneys, will not properly sedate him during the execution process, causing agony and terror as he struggles to breathe. A request for clemency was denied by <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] on Tuesday without comment. Federal Judge Gregory Frost scheduled a Friday court date to hear arguments regarding the proposed delay. 

<p>In November 2011, the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/SCO/justices/oconnor/default.aspx">Maureen O'Connor</a> [official profile] opened the first meeting of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">death panel review committee</a> [JURIST report]. O'Connor <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ohio-death-penalty-procedure-to-be-reviewed.php">announced the formation of the committee</a> [JURIST report] in September, in response to Frost's July ruling, which <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/07/14/ruling-halts-ohio-executions.html">stayed the executions of two inmates</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report]. Frost agreed with their arguments that Ohio executes inmates haphazardly, causing an unofficial death penalty moratorium as the federal courts considered the constitutionality of the state's death penalty procedure. In December 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ohio-supreme-court-rejects-challeng-to-lethal-injection-method.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the lethal injection method of execution and indicated that they would not hear further cases regarding lethal injection until the Ohio General Assembly explicitly expanded state review of death penalty cases. In November 2009, Ohio adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">single-drug lethal injection protocol</a> [JURIST report], replacing the previously used three-drug method. The single-drug lethal injection method has faced numerous challenges, with one case reaching the US Supreme Court. In March 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate challenging the state's single-drug execution protocol. Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new procedure in December 2009. The change in procedure came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> [JURIST report] of its lethal injection practices in September 2009, following the planned execution of inmate Romell Broom failed when a suitable vein for the drugs' administration could not be found.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors had accused Bruins of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/world/europe/former-nazi-faces-trial-in-world-war-ii-killing.html?_r=0">executing</a> [NYT report] captured Dutch Nazi-opposition fighter Aldert Klaas Dijkema in September 1944 outside the town of Appingedam. Bruins and an accomplice, who has since died, are accused of taking Dijkema, a prisoner at the time, to an isolated location and then shooting him four times. The suspects reported at the time that Dijkema had been trying to escape when they shot him. Bruins, who was born Dutch but is now a German citizen, was sentenced to prison in the 1980s for the murder of two Dutch Jews during the Second World War. Judge Heike Hartmann-Garschagen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25655092">concluded</a> [BBC report] that there were to too many gaps in the evidence to properly convict Bruins as no witnesses could be called in the 70-year-old case.The decision comes on the same day an 88 year-old German man <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25656746">was charged</a> [BBC report] with 25 counts murder in connection with the massacre in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/03/oradour-sur-glane-nazi-massacre-village">Oradour-sur-Glane</a> [Guardian backgrounder] in central France, where 642 people were murdered by Nazi SS troops in 1944.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to arrest individuals charged with war crimes during the Holocaust.In June 2013 Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hungary-prosecutors-charge-accused-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Laszlo Csatary, a 98-year-old Hungarian man, with the unlawful execution and torture of people in connection with the Holocaust. Csatary <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-dies-awaiting-trial.php">died</a> [JURIST report] in August 2013 while awaiting trial. In May 2013 German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp.

According to the prosecution, Warner C murdered 25 people and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25656746">aided and abetted</a> [BBC reports] fellow Nazi SS troops in the murder of 642 people during the incident. Media outlets report that 60 SS troops were brought to trial in the 1950's for the massacre. While 20 were convicted, all were subsequently released. Werner C's lawyer has reportedly admitted his client's presence in the French village during the massacre but denied any involvement in the killings themselves.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to charge individuals with crimes related to Germany's Nazi era. In December a German district court in Ellwangen <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/german-court-rules-former-auschwitz-guard-unfit-for-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that accused former Auschwitz guard, Hans Lipschis, is unfit to stand trial.

The court found that restricting a child's surname to that of its father violated Article 8 (right to respect for private and family) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The case was brought by Alessandra Cusan and Luigi Fazzo, married Italian nationals, who wanted to include their daughter on the civil register under her mother's family name, Cusan. The Constitutional Court of Italy <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/003-4624361-5596419">ruled</a> [ECHR press release, PDF] in 2006 that only the <a href="http://www.senato.it/home">Italian Parliament</a> [official website, in Italian] could decide the issue. The court held that the system where a child's surname was determined solely on the basis of the parent's sex, without the possibility of deviation was excessively rigid and discriminatory towards women in violation of Article 8 and Article 14 when read together.

<p>The ECHR <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Court_in_brief_ENG.pdf">rules</a> [ECHR backgrounder; PDF] on individual or state applications alleging violations of the civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. In December the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/europe-rights-court-criminal-conviction-for-armenian-genocide-denial-unjustified.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that prosecutions for denying that the killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 was a genocide are an attack on freedom of expression. Also in December lawyers for two Guantanamo detainees, arguing before the ECHR, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/guantanamo-detainees-accuse-poland-in-cia-rendition-torture.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Poland of serving as a secret torture site for the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a>'s (CIA) [official website] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive].

In September a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-issues-injunction-against-apple-in-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">enjoined Apple</a> [JURIST report] from contracting with publishing companies that restrict, limit or impede the Apple's ability to set, alter or reduce the retail price of any e-book for a period of five years. The order also appointed Bromwich as overseer of Apple's compliance with the judgment. Apple's attorneys previously asserted that Bromwich <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/343006/economy/companies/apple-seeks-removal-of-court-appointed-antitrust-monitor">exceeded his mandate</a> [Reuters report] by seeking to interview top executives before the date set by the court. Now Apple alleges that Bromwich is biased against the company and that his fee of more than $1000 (USD) an hour incentivizes intrusive and overzealous inspection into the company's affairs. 

<p>The September injunction followed a July decision which <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-finds-apple-guilty-of-e-book-price-fixing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Apple violated the Sherman Act and various state statutes in an e-book price-fixing conspiracy. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) accused Apple of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books. Five publishers, Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon &#38; Schuster Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and Macmillan, were originally named in the complaint, but all have since reached a settlement with the government. In May the judge presiding over the case <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-believes-doj-will-prevail-in-apple-antitrust-case.php">issued a tentative ruling</a> [JURST report] that the government would be successful in its antitrust claim. The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April 2012, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May of last year.      </p>]]></content:encoded>

Belin was <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/french-court-upholds-controversial-burqa-ban-468654">sentenced</a> [AFP report] to one month in prison for insulting and threatening three police officers at the time of her arrest and fined &#8364;150 (USD $200) for wearing the veil. Her lawyers had requested a ruling on the constitutionality of the ban before sentencing, which was rejected on the grounds that the Constitutional Council had previously upheld the law. Opponents of the law argue that it is discriminatory and unconstitutional, while proponents of the law argue that it is necessary because the number of France's Muslims are changing the nature of the country.</p>

<p>Under the French ban, people caught wearing facial coverings in public can be fined &#8364;150 and/or ordered to take a citizenship class. In addition, anyone convicted of forcing a someone else to cover their face <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEgiMW33brZhPohZrPSXS_zbE8lQ?docId=CNG.454c1042a774374e5f29a46c701d14b2.7b1&hl=fr">may be fined up to &#8364;30,000 and jailed for one year</a> [AFP report, in French], and the penalties double if the incident involves a minor. The ban affects citizens, residents and tourists alike, and extends to <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/04/08/01016-20110408ARTFIG00630-voile-signes-religieux-ce-qui-est-interdit-en-france.php">all public places</a> [Le Figaro backgrounder, in French], including airports, hospitals, government offices and even places of worship that are open to the public. Despite condemnation from human rights groups, other jurisdictions, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-burqa-ban-takes-effect.php">Belgium</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/netherlands-plans-to-ban-muslim-face-veils.php">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/italy-lawmakers-approve-draft-burqa-ban-law.php">Italy</a>, have also passed or considered similar legislation [JURIST reports]. The burqa ban in France officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-veil-ban-goes-into-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST reports] on April 11, 2011 after the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/">French National Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill on July 13, 2010.

Legal commentators have <a href="/forum/2012/02/maurits-berger-burqa-ban.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that burqa bans are political necessities, rather than legal ones, and therefore legal rationale and political justification are weak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former intelligence chief Josip Perkovic was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/us-croatia-spy-extradition-idUSBREA070TD20140108">arrested</a> [Reuters report] on January 1 as Croatia acted to comply with EU extradition law. Perkovic, who worked for the Yugoslav federal secret service (UBDA), helped set up Croatia's national intelligence agency when it seceded from Belgrade in 1991 and held senior security posts throughout the 1990s. Perkovic is wanted in Germany in connection with the 1983 murder of a Yugoslav dissident in Bavaria. Before joining the EU in July, the government of Croatia changed its laws to prevent the extradition of suspects in crimes committed before 2002, to protect veterans from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croatian War for Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. However, in August, when the European Commission warned that the country could face <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/eu-warns-croatia-on-extradition-law.php">legal action</a> [JURIST report] for not complying with EU extradition standards, the government removed the time restriction. Perkovic denies any wrongdoing and is expected to appeal to the country's supreme court. 

<p>Croatia has previously been criticized by groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] for the slow pace of war crimes investigations. AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">noted</a> [report, PDF] that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. Amidst pressure to the tackle this issue of corruption, the <a href="/dateline/2012/04/ann-eisenberg-croatia-eu.php">push to join the EU</a> was a <a href="/dateline/2012/05/dora-rotar-croatia-eu.php">primary focus</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the nation's rulers for years. Last January the Croatian people <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/croatia-citizens-votes-to-join-eu.php">voted in favor of joining the EU</a>, a month after the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/croatia-signs-treaty-to-join-eu.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST reports] to finalize its EU accession. The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-gives-final-approval-to-croatia-membership.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] for Croatian membership in 2011 after six years of negotiations. The EU had previously <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended accession talks</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 when it felt Croatia was not cooperating fully with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia investigations into war crimes against its former military officers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Beyani noted that the number of displaced civilians has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46886&Cr=Central+African+Republic&Cr1=#.Us3OHCinVgJ">drastically increased</a> [UN News Centre report] in recent weeks, and approximately one-half of those displaced are from the capital city of Bangui. Beyani welcomed the attempts by various humanitarian agencies to provide support within the CAR, however stated that the international community must strengthen its support of displaced individuals, especially "women, children, and those with disabilities."

<p>There have been continued reports of gross human rights violations in the CAR since rebel forces, known as Seleka, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150044">seized the nation's capital</a> [BBC backgrounder] in March of last year. The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] in December describing horrific attacks against children that have occurred in the CAR during that month alone. In the same month, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] voted unanimously to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">authorize deployment of peacekeepers</a> [JURIST report] to the CAR, following escalating violence in the nation's capital of Bangui. In November the UN Deputy Secretary-General urged the Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-senior-official-urges-security-council-to-take-action-in-the-car.php">vote in favor</a> [JURIST report] of further military intervention. Earlier in November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violence-in-the-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that continued violence between militias, rebels and government forces in the CAR threatened to lead the country into renewed conflict. Michel Djotodia declared himself the nation's leader in March after the Seleka seized the nation's capital and caused Bozize to flee the country. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels and advocated for the "swift restoration of constitutional order."</p>]]></content:encoded>

This directive comes as a result of Monday's decision by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily block</a> [JURIST report] the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state of Utah. The <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/">Utah Attorney General</a> [official website] filed an <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2013/12/Application-for-Stay.pdf">application for stay</a> [text, PDF] with the court last week to block same-sex marriages pending the state's appeal of a US district judge's December 20 <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] striking down the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage. Three similar applications to the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] have already been <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rejects-Utah-state-request-to-block-same-sex-marriages.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report]. Tuesday's directive by the governor's office also specifies that no further same-sex marriages are to be performed or given legal recognition within the state "pending final resolution by the courts."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has recently been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. On Monday four same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/arizona-couples-file-lawsuit-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Arizona, seeking to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. In December the US District Court for the District of Utah ruled that Utah's constitutional and statutory bans on same-sex marriage violated due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.

Cuomo's plan states that the pilot program "will allow qualified eligible participants to seek relief for their symptoms in a safe and legal manner, while also evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of a medical marijuana system" and noted that the findings of the program will help create future policy. The plan creates the program within current New York <a href="http://www.weblaws.org/new_york/laws/n.y._public_health_law_article_33-a_controlled_substances_therapeutic_research_act_(3397-a_-_3397-g)">statutory authority</a> [PHL Art. 33-A text], which currently allows New York to establish medical marijuana research programs in hospitals. Critics have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-new-york-pot-20140108,0,3200968.story#axzz2ptlj0rmr">claimed</a> [LAT report] that the reliance on this statute is unworkable in the long-term.

<p>If enacted, Cuomo's plan will make New York the twenty-first state to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">Marijuana legalization</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has created controversy in the US, and JURIST Guest Columnist Alex Kriet predicts that 2014 will be a <a href="/forum/2013/11/alex-kreit-marijuana-legalization.php">groundbreaking year</a> [JURIST op-ed] for marijuana policy. In November Colorado voters <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-voters-approve-tax-on-recreational-marijuan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] Proposition AA, which levies a tax on all sales of recreational marijuana in the state. In late October the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-arizona-medical-marijuana-regulation.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Arizona medical marijuana regulation. In mid-October Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-voters-approve-tax-on-recreational-marijuan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] rules for recreational sale of marijuana. In August the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-will-not-challenge-state-marijuana-legalization-efforts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would not interfere with states experimenting with marijuana legalization. Also in August New Jersey governor Chris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-jersey-governor-sends-medical-marijuana-bill-back-to-legislature.php">sent back a bill</a> [JURIST report] which would have made marijuana more accessible.

CNIL has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/us-france-google-fine-idUSBREA0719U20140108">ordered</a> [Reuters report] Google to post a response to the decision on the Google France homepage within 8 days from last Friday. In March 2012 Google consolidated all 60 privacy policies for its services into one and began combining data collected on individual users across all its services without permitting users to opt-out, which CNIL states is in violation of French data laws. The organization also states that:<blockquote>[Google] does not sufficiently inform its users of the conditions in which their personal data are processed, nor of the purposes of this processing. They may therefore neither understand the purposes for which their data are collected, which are not specific as the law requires, nor the ambit of the data collected through the different services concerned. Consequently, they are not able to exercise their rights, in particular their right of access, objection or deletion.</blockquote>CNIL also criticized Google for failing to obtain user consent prior to storing cookies on users' terminals, failing to define retention periods for the data Google processes, and for combining all of the data it collects across all services without any legal basis.

<p>Google has faced international criticism for alleged privacy violations. In November the <a href="http://www.dutchdpa.nl/Pages/home.aspx">Dutch Data Protection Authority</a> (DPA) [official website] stated that Google [corporate website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/netherlands-say-google-violates-data-protection-laws.php">in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's data protection act. Earlier that month, the Regional Court of Berlin held that 25 of Google's privacy policies and terms of service <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/germany-court-rules-google-violated-german-data-protection-law.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] Germany's data protection law. Last September the US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-googles-motion-to-dismiss-street-view-privacy-case.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss a lawsuit against Google for allegedly violating a federal wiretap law while collecting data for its Street View [corporate website] program. The case arose after Google acknowledged that its <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/views/home?hl=en&gl=us">Street View</a> vehicles had been collecting and storing data over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks, including personal e-mails, usernames, passwords, videos and documents. In April Google agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">$7 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] of another case for alleged improper data collection during its Street View campaign. That same month, six European countries, including France, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">commenced legal action</a> [JURIST report] against the corporation challenging its privacy policies, which has generated <a href="/forum/2012/11/clark-asay-eu-privacy.php">scholarship</a> [JURIST op-ed] over how European response to Google's privacy policies could impact the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In one of the largest mass trials to date, 63 individuals were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/09/us-egypt-brotherhood-idUSBREA080JX20140109">sentenced</a> [Reuters report] to three years in prison on charges of rioting, thuggery and weapons possession stemming from protest in Cairo in November. The sentence includes a fine of 50,000 Egyptian Pounds (USD $7,181). Bail was set at 5,000 Egyptian pounds (USD $720) allowing the convicted to remain free from prison while they appeal the verdict. According to Reuters, in a separate trial 24 Brotherhood supporters were also sentenced to three years in prison, with labor, over clashes around the same time in a different part of Cairo. In the third case, a court sentenced 26 students of <a href="http://www.azhar.edu.eg/">Al-Azhar University</a> [official website, in Arabic] to two-and-a-half years in prison each. The University, located in Cairo, has been the site of multiple anti-government and pro-Morsi rallies since Morsi's ousting.

<p>Earlier this week the Muslim Brotherhood <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ousted-egypt-ruling-party-files-complaint-with-icc-alleging-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] alleging widespread and systematic crimes against humanity have been committed by the Egyptian military since its <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">July coup</a> [JURIST report] removing President Morsi from power. In December, 139 Morsi supporters were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-court-sentences-139-protesters-in-mass-trial.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two year prison terms  on a variety of charges including rioting and sabotage during a July 15 protest demanding Morsi's reinstatement. Earlier that month Egyptian state media <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Morsi-to-stand-trial-for-espionage.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that ousted Morsi will be tried on charges of espionage and terrorism along with 35 other defendants, many of whom are also former high-level officials and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

According to court registrar Abdul Ghani Soomro, the judges have examined Musharraf's medical report submitted by the hospital and have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/pakistan-court-orders-musharraf-attend">concluded</a> [AP report] that Musharraf is fit to appear before the court. The court said that there is no indication that he has suffered a heart attack. The court had <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-medical-report.php">previously granted</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf an exemption from personal appearance due to health issues on Monday, but instructed authorities at the <a href="http://afic.gov.pk/">Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology</a> (AFIC) [official website] where Musharraf has been staying to supply the court with his medical report by Tuesday. The demand came after Musharraf <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/655477/islamabad-court-rejects-petition-seeking-ban-on-musharrafs-exit-from-pakistan/">missed another hearing</a> [Express Tribune report] complaining of chest pain. Prosecutor Akram Sheikh has accused Musharraf of checking into the AFIC hospital in Rawalpindi to avoid hearings rather than to address actual health concerns. 

<p>Musharraf has faced a slew of legal troubles since returning to Pakistan almost a year ago. In December the Islamabad High Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/pakistan-court-rules-treason-trial-against-musharraf-will-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the former president's trial for treason would continue despite Musharraf's challenges to the legitimacy of the proceedings. Earlier that month he was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-pakistan-president-musharraf-granted-bail-in-red-mosque-killings-case.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] in a criminal case relating to the death of a radical cleric. In August the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. Also that month a Pakistani court officially <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a>[BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>]. In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. That same month, the <a href="http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/index.php">Peshawar High Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] both <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf from running for public office for the rest of his life and extended his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. Msuharraf left Pakistan in 2008 to live in self-imposed exile in Dubai and London after he was defeated by Bhutto's party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A French court in Aix-En Province order the extradition of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25666111">Mukhtar Ablyazov</a> [BBC profile], Kazakhstan's former energy minister accused of misappropriating $6 billion from <a href="http://www.bta.kz/en/">BTA Bank</a> [corporate website]. The French court <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/french-court-oks-extradition-kazakh-ex-banker">agreed</a> [AP report] to the extradition requests from Russia and Ukraine, which both house BTA Bank branches, partly because France does not have an extradition agreement with Kazakhstan. In 2011 Ablyazov <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/12/kazakhstan-financial-sector">gained political asylum</a> [<em>UK Guardian</em> report] in the UK after alleging that he faced prosecution in Kazakhstan because he was the leading figure in the opposition against Kazakhstan president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4489174.stm">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a> [BBC profile]. Ablyazov also claimed that he had been imprisoned for political reasons prior to these charges. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/france-stop-extradition-threatening-kazakhstani-dissident-torture-2014-01-09">urged</a> [press release] against Ablyazov's extradition on Thursday after the French court's ruling. Julie Hall, AI expert on counter-terrorism and human rights, said, "Not only do we have fears that Ablyazov would not get a fair trial in Russia or Ukraine, there is a real danger that he will eventually end up in Kazakhstan, where he will be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment." Her fears are brought about by a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR04/001/2013/en/6c3910ea-30bb-4b67-a7f2-b2ffc5780a09/eur040012013en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on the routine cooperation of Russia and Ukraine with central Asian republics, including Kazakhstan, to transfer people back to the area, often in violation of human rights. 

<p>Kazakhstan has recently drawn international criticism for its human rights record. In November a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-a-court-in-kazakhstan.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of an outspoken opposition leader accused of inciting dissent in an attempt to overthrow the government. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] claimed that oil workers in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. In August HRW urged Kazakhstan to ensure that the trials of Kozlov, another political activist, and an oil worker <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">comport with international legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for fair trials. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-urges-kazakhstan-to-allow-independent-probe-into-december-unrest.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into the December unrest between oil workers and an oil company. In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-demands-kazakhstan-justify-charges-against-political-activists.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan publicly disclose the reason for bringing new charges against a group of labor activists and an oil worker who participated in the December unrest. The committee charged them with "calling for the forcible overthrow of the constitutional order." Earlier that month a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 13 out of 37 defendants to between three and seven years of imprisonment for their participation in unrest that occurred last December. Sixteen of the remaining defendants faced <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18323805">conditional sentences</a> [BBC report] while five defendants were given amnesty and three were acquitted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]  approved a deal on Wednesday between the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/">US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase</a> [corporate website] to settle the criminal charges of failure to report suspicions about Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jp-morgan-chase-agrees-to-settlement-penalty-in-madoff-case.php">entered</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January14/JPMCDPASupportingDocs/JPMC%20DPA%20Packet%20%28Fully%20Executed%20w%20Exhibits%29.pdf">deferred prosecution agreement</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday in exchange for the bank paying $1.7 billion, the largest amount paid by a US bank for a <a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/bsa/">Bank Secrecy Act</a> [US Department of Treasury backgrounder] violation, to the US government. Judge Kevin Castel <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-judge-oks-jpmorgan-17b-deal-government">said</a> [AP report] there was nothing about the agreement that would "require judicial intervention to protect the integrity of the process." Castel set a date in January 2016 for the government to report to the court on JP Morgan's compliance with the agreement. 

<p>Legal action continues from the fallout of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">2008 Madoff Ponzi scheme</a> [JURIST news archive], which defrauded investors of approximately $65 billion. Madoff held the majority of his firm's assets in accounts at JP Morgan and it is unlikely the deferred prosecution agreement will mark the end of the the bank's legal involvement in the case. The US Supreme Court is scheduled to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/picard-v-jpmorgan-chase-co/">hold a conference</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] on Friday to discuss a pending petition brought from Irving Picard, the court appointed trustee in charge of the <a href="http://www.madofftrustee.com/facts-08.html">Madoff Recovery Initiative</a> [trustee website], against JPMorgan. In September a judge for the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/madoff-victims-not-entitled-to-interest-bankruptcy-judge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that victims can only recover the principal amount invested without accounting for inflation over the past five years and excluding interest. Last April a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-madoff-victims-suit-against-sec.php">rejected a suit</a> [JURIST report] by victims against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

B4A is partnered with <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/">Privacy International</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/press-releases/privacy-international-files-legal-challenge-against-uk-government-over-mass">filed a similar suit</a> [wired report] last July. B4A's claim states that the UK's mass surveillance activities, including Tempora, violate the  <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text] by failing to protect privacy and freedom of expression, and that they disproportionately affect those who are not UK citizens. The suit's argument is set apart from past similar arguments by its inclusion of discriminatory factors under Article 14 of the ECHR as well. <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/24/gchq-tempora-101">Tempora </a>[Wired report] is a program of <a href="http://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx">Government Communications Headquarters</a> (GCHQ) [official website]. The GCHQ placed data interceptors on fiber-optic cables that carry internet data in and out of the UK, including transatlantic cables carrying data between the US and Europe. B4A is asking the Tribunal, which was created to deal with complaints regarding surveillance by UK public bodies, to issue a declaration that such programs are unlawful as well as an order to destroy any unlawfully obtained material. 

<p>The revelations following the disclosure of the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Administration's</a> (NSA) [official website] surveillance programs have sparked worldwide <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">debate </a>and <a href="/hotline/2013/06/samar-warsi-fourth-amendment.php">controversy </a>[JURIST op-eds]. In December Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/ai-files-lawsuit-against-uk-surveillance-program.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that it had filed a complaint against the UK government over concerns that the country's intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, unlawfully accessed AI's communications. Also in December, UN Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism Ben Emmerson stated that he plans to<a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-counterterrorism-official-to-investigate-us-uk-surveillance.php"> launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the surveillance activities of the NSA and the GCHQ. US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/senators-propose-overhaul-of-us-surveillance-laws.php">announced new legislation</a> [JURIST report] in September in a bipartisan effort to reform surveillance laws. Earlier that month the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers, despite the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's</a> [official website] release of a previously classified opinion <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">justifying </a>[JURIST report] the need for the NSA's surveillance program. In August the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program, which included orders to employees to destroy certain government computer equipment. Claims stemming Snowden's revelations were <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/uk-spy-agency-facing-rights-court-challenge-over-surveillance.php">filed </a>[JURIST report] in the ECHR in October that allege that the NSA's massive online surveillance programs, which are able to read the content of e-mails and social media messages, have breached the privacy of tens of millions of people across the UK and Europe.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 237 criminalizes other acts between members of the same sex, including intimate kissing, as well. The letter states that prior to his election,<a href="http://www.jpost.com/Iranian-Threat/News/Human-rights-groups-call-on-Irans-regime-to-stop-violent-repression-of-gays-337559"> Rouhani made promises</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] to allow greater individual freedoms to Iranians, and calls on the president to repeal its anti-LGBT laws.

<p>LGBT individuals have gained increased rights globally in the last decade, but many still face discrimination and criminal punishment throughout the world. In September the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/first-un-ministerial-meeting-on-gay-rights-held.php">first UN ministerial meeting</a> [JURIST report] on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals was held during the General Assembly's annual high-level debate.  Also in September, US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-process-same-sex-visa-applications.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that the US will begin processing same-sex visa applications the same way opposite-sex visa applications are processed. Speaking at the US embassy in London, Kerry stated, "As long as a marriage has been performed in the jurisdiction that recognizes it, then that marriage is valid under US immigration laws." In June Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/putin-signs-bill-into-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill banning the promotion of "homosexual propaganda" among minors.

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/un-agency-wants-probe-of-brazil-prison-violence/2014/01/08/3b20540a-78b1-11e3-a647-a19deaf575b3_story.html">video</a> [AP report], sent on Tuesday, was allegedly sent by a state prison worker's union to draw attention to the state's neglect of the penitentiary system. According to former president Jose Sarney, delays in the country's legal system have created prison overcrowding, which has resulted in an increase in prison violence. The Pedrinhas Penitentiary Complex only has space for 1,700 inmates but is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/world/americas/brazilian-state-in-spotlight-after-gruesome-prison-video.html">currently housing</a> [NYT report] more than 2,200. The Maranhao state government has confirmed that four inmates were killed on December 17 but could not comment on the authenticity of the video.

<p>The <a href="https://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] has also <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2013/086.asp">expressed concern</a> [press release] over prison violence in Brazil, particularly in the Pedrinhas Penitentiary Complex, after it was reported that a large number of deaths had taken place at the prison over the past year. <a href="www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has also criticized the government's lack of solutions to prison violence "unacceptable." AI's report, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/fr/library/info/AMR19/008/1993/en">"Brazil: Death has arrived,"</a> [report, text] found that the governor of Sao Paulo and the Secretary of Public Security abdicated their responsibilities by handing complete control of the prison to the military police and were therefore also responsible for Sao Paulo's Carandiru prison in 1992, in which more than 100 inmates died. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/brazil-prison-massacre-verdict-vital-step-towards-justice-2013-04-22">considered</a> [press release] the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/brazil-court-sentences-police-to-life-for-prison-massacre.php">conviction</a> of 23 Brazilian police officers for the massacre a "vital" step towards justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The periodic review board (PRB) was established by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/executive-order-periodic-review-individuals-detained-guant-namo-bay-nava">Executive Order 13567</a> [text]. Mujahid was never charged by the military commission, but was originally believed too dangerous to release. However, the PRB ruled that Mujahid no longer posed a security risk and could be transferred, pending a determination that the facility he would be transferred to provides adequate security and humanitarian conditions. The PRB based their decision on continued improvement of the security situation in Yemen and appropriate rehabilitation programs become available.  

<p>Mujahid is the latest detainee to be cleared for transfer. Last week, three Uighur Muslim detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/last-uighur-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Slovakia. The three detainees were the last of the 22 Uighurs to be released from Guantanamo since the 2008 ruling. In December two detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/dod-transfers-two-guantanamo-detainees-to-algeria.php">transferred to their native Algeria</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the DOD ruled that media entities would <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/media-not-allowed-to-observe-parole-style-guantanamo-hearing-dod.php">not be allowed</a> [JURIST report] to sit in on the first session of the Periodic Review Board hearings, parole-type hearings for detainees that were established by 2011 legislation. The week before a military judge ordered the US government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/military-judge-orders-submission-of-guantanamo-reports.php">submit reports</a> [JURIST report] on prison conditions and removed restrictions on communications between lawyers and detainees.

The government <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25673011">said</a> [BBC report] that there was no evidence against forty-five of the detainees and that there was insufficient evidence against the other twenty-seven to bring them to trial. Karzai's spokesperson stated that the continued detention of the prisoners was an illegal violation of Afghan sovereignty, and that the government could not allow Afghan citizens to be held for months and years at a time without being subject to trial. A US State Department spokeswoman reportedly <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/01/10/afghanistan-usa-idINDEEA010A920140110">responded</a> [Reuters report] to the decision by stating that the seventy-two prisoners are dangerous criminals and that there is strong evidence linking them to terrorist activities and the killings of Afghan citizens and US troops. Coming in the wake of Karzai's refusal to sign an Afghan-US security deal, this move demonstrates the increasing tension between the two administrations and it is yet unclear what impact the move will have on any security agreement between them. US officials have reportedly threatened to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan if a deal is not reached, though Karzai has responded to such statements by calling them "empty threats."

<p>Controversy about detaining prisoners has been a major source of contention in US-Afghan relations. In September  the non-profit human rights law firm Justice Project Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-still-holding-detainees-without-charges-at-bagram-report.php?edition=US">released</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing the conditions at Bagram, claiming that the US was still holding many prisoners there indefinitely without trial, including many prisoners from outside of Afghanistan. In June Karzai's administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/afghanistan-president-demands-transfer-of-prisoners-of-war-at-bagram.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that prisoners of war held at Bagram be transferred to Afghan control, citing their detention as a violation of Afghan sovereignty. Those events <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/us-transfers-full-control-of-bagram-prison-to-afghanistan.php">followed</a> [JURIST report] the official transfer of Bagram prison from US to Afghan control in March 2013. In November 2012 the Karzai administration <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/afghanistan-president-claims-us-violating-detainee-pact.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] the US had been violating a detainee transfer pact by continually capturing and holding Afghan citizens. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court for Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled on Thursday that Russia must pay 1.9 million euros, or $2.6 million, to the families of 36 Chechen men who disappeared between 2000 and 2006. The court found that Russia was in violation of Articles 2, 3, 5 and 13 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. These violations concern the right to life, prohibition of inhuman treatment, right to liberty and security and right to an effective remedy. The court <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-chechnya-european-court-human-rights-/25225424.html">found</a> [Radio Free Europe report] that the families presented credible evidence towards their claim that their loved ones have been seized by the Russian military and Russia had failed to prove that the military was not responsible for the disappearances. It is unclear whether Russia will appeal the judgment to a higher human rights court. 

<p>The ECHR has repeatedly ruled against Russia in human rights cases involving <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chechnya">Chechnya</a> [JURIST news archive], and rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-groups-urge-russia-to-enforce.php">urged Russia to enforce the judgments</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/europe-rights-court-holds-russia-liable.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Russia to pay a total of 282,000 euros to compensate the families of Chechen abduction victims. Also in 2009 the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">ordered Russia</a> [JURIST report] to pay 37,000 euros to a Russian national for the death of her husband, who was chopping wood when Russian troops killed him in 2000. In 2008 the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-orders-russia-to.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] Russia had violated the human rights of six other Chechens who disappeared between 2001 and 2003, and ordered Russia to pay the victims' families 320,000 euros. Also in 2008 former Russian president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047827">Dmitry Medvedev</a> [BBC profile] proposed that <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">Russian courts become more transparent</a> [JURIST report] in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the ECHR.<br />

The challenge focuses on Kansas's two-tiered voter registration system, which requires voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote in local and state elections, but not federal elections. The ACLU charges that eligible voters are being divided into separate and unequal classes in violation of the Kansas Constitution's equal protection guarantees. Despite being transferred to federal court, the ACLU claims their challenge only focuses on violations of the state constitution. This, they allege in their <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/ACLU-seeks-to-return-voter-lawsuit-to-Kan-court-5130563.php">latest petition</a> [AP report], places the challenge more properly in state court. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] has ruled that laws requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections are unconstitutional, but it has preserved the states' rights to control who will vote in state and local elections. Arizona has adopted a similar two-tier voter registration system in response to the Supreme Court's ruling.

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/voter-id-laws.php">Voter ID laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a controversial issue throughout the US. Kansas <a href="https://www.sos.ks.gov/">Secretary of State Kris Kobach</a> and Arizona <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/">Secretary of State Ken Bennett</a> [official profiles] filed a complaint in August in the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] demanding that the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) [official website] modify federal voter registration forms to allow states to require proof of citizenship. The two-tier system in question allows voters who use the National registration form, which does not require proof of citizenship, to vote only in national elections. Voters must use the Kansas voter registration form in order to be eligible to also vote in local and state elections. There are now more than <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx">30 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including multiple states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. In October the Tennessee Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/tennessee-high-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">unanimously rejected</a> [JURIST report] a movement to overturn the Tennessee Voter Identification Act, ruling that a requirement of government-issued photo ID for voters is constitutional. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmorocco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Justice and Human Rights Commission of Morocco's parliament on Thursday announced a proposal to amend Article 475 of the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=190447&tab=2">penal code</a> [text, in French], which allows rapists to avoid charges if they marry their victims. This practice is currently encouraged in countries such as Morocco and India, where the loss of a woman's virginity out of wedlock is said to bring shame upon the family. Article 475, translated from French, reads, "When a minor removed or diverted married her captor, the latter can not be prosecuted on the complaint of persons entitled to apply for annulment of marriage and can not be sentenced until after the cancellation of marriage has been pronounced." The proposal will be put to a vote by Parliament. 

<p>Thursday's announcement takes place a year after the Moroccan government <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/morocco-to-change-rape-law-allowing-marriage.php">promised to change</a> [JURIST report] the controversial law. Nearly a year before this promise, 16-year-old Amina al-Filali <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20120317-morocco-women-stage-protest-against-rape-laws/">committed suicide</a> [AFP report] after she was forced to marry her alleged rapist. Soon after, protesters in Morocco rallied to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/protesters-rally-against-morocco-rape-marriage-law-after-teen-suicide.php">call for the reform</a> [JURIST report] of Article 475. In July 2011 Moroccan voters overwhelmingly approved a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/morocco-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-revised-constitution.php">revised version of the constitution</a> [JURIST report], highlighted by fewer powers reserved for their king. The constitutional revisions were a product of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/morocco-king-announces-plans-for-constitutional-reform.php">reform process announced</a> [JURIST report] last April following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST reports] demanding democratic reforms as part of the wider protests in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=middle+east+protest">news archive</a>]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Both nations expressed anger over the law, claiming that it unnecessarily complicates relations between the countries and creates new tensions over territorial disputes. The Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs statement claimed the move "unnecessarily complicates the situation in the South China Sea, and threatens the peace and stability of the region." A Vietnamese spokesperson reportedly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/philippines-vietnam-condemn-chinas-fishing-law/2014/01/10/725fb874-79e3-11e3-a647-a19deaf575b3_story.html">demanded</a> [<em>WP</em> report] that China immediately abolish the action in order to maintain peace and stability. The Philippines has asked China to give clarification of the new regulation, saying that China is in violation of international law under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and of a 2002 agreement between members of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to maintain the status quo in the South China Sea. China has become increasingly assertive in enforcing its territorial claims in the region, leading to tense conflict between the nation and its regional neighbors. 

<p>Territorial disputes over the South China Sea <a href="/forum/2012/10/michael-kelly-china-unclos.php">have been</a> [JURIST Forum] an ongoing source of tension between China and its neighboring countries. Many national claims to territory overlap, causing uncertainty and efforts by many of the nations attempting to assert their claims. In January 2013 the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-takes-south-china-sea-dispute-to-un-tribunal.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] China of its intention to seek international arbitration to declare many of China's territorial claims in the South China Sea illegal. China claims ownership of the majority of the Sea, an area rich in resources and minerals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the 18 days that same-sex marriage was legal in Utah, approximately 1,300 couples were wed. Holder confirmed that these couples will be entitled to federal benefits, stating that "these families should not be asked to endure uncertainty regarding their status as the litigation unfolds." This announcement comes a day after <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> [advocacy website] wrote a <a href="http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/Holder.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Holder arguing that "there is simply no reason for the United States government not to extend federal recognition" to those who were legally married. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an intensely debated issue in the US and has been the cause for recent controversy in the state of Utah.

The <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/">Utah Attorney General</a> [official website] then filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">application for stay</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] last week to block same-sex marriages pending the state's appeal of the decision. The Supreme Court on Monday responded by <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocking</a> [JURIST report] the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state. On Tuesday, the office of Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/index.html">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official profile] sent an e-mail to state Cabinet members, directing them to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-governor-directs-cabinet-not-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">place legal recognition of same-sex marriages within the state on hold</a> [JURIST report] until further notice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pavlov, an associate of opposition figure Mukhtar Ablyazov, whose extradition was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/french-court-orders-extradition-of-khazakstans-former-energy-minsiter.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Thursday by a French court, has been detained by Spanish authorities since 2012 on charges of financial and terrorism-related crimes. According to Crepeau, the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46899&Cr=Kazakh&Cr1=#.UtBupWRDu6o">human rights of a foreigner</a> [press release] should be dealt with no differently than those of a citizen, placing the onus of responsibility upon the Spanish government to ensure Pavlov will not be subjected to any form of persecution. Spain's high court approved Pavlov's extradition in November, with his fate now being decided by a final arbiter, the Council of Ministers. 

<p>Kazakhstan has recently drawn international criticism for its human rights record. In November a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-a-court-in-kazakhstan.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of an outspoken opposition leader accused of inciting dissent in an attempt to overthrow the government. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] claimed that oil workers in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. In August HRW urged Kazakhstan to ensure that the trials of Kozlov, another political activist, and an oil worker <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">comport with international legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for fair trials. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-urges-kazakhstan-to-allow-independent-probe-into-december-unrest.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into the December unrest between oil workers and an oil company. In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-demands-kazakhstan-justify-charges-against-political-activists.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan publicly disclose the reason for bringing new charges against a group of labor activists and an oil worker who participated in the December unrest. The committee charged them with "calling for the forcible overthrow of the constitutional order." Earlier that month a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 13 out of 37 defendants to between three and seven years of imprisonment for their participation in unrest that occurred last December. Sixteen of the remaining defendants faced <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18323805">conditional sentences</a> [BBC report] while five defendants were given amnesty and three were acquitted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Aereo, Inc.</a> [docket materials], to decide the legality of <a href="https://www.aereo.com/">Aereo's</a> [corporate website]  online service that streams and records publicly broadcast television programming without paying the broadcasters. Aereo charges users a monthly fee to view broadcast TV channels on the users' computers or mobile devices. The plaintiffs, including the networks <a href="http://abc.go.com/">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/">20th Century Fox</a>, <a href="http://www.cbs.com/">CBS</a>, and <a href="http://www.nbcuni.com/">NBCUniversal</a> [corporate websites], filed the <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ABCvAereo_11Oct13.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] for <em>certiorari</em> after the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/WNET_v_Aereo_Inc_712_F3d_676_106_USPQ2d_1341_2013_ILRC_1603_35_IL">denied their requested injunction</a> [opinion] to shut down Aereo until the case is heard. The broadcasters claim that Aereo's service violates their copyrights on the broadcast materials and will affect their ability to generate subscription and advertising revenue. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the decision to grant <em>certiorari</em>.

<p>This is one of several recent high profile copyright cases. In November, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-dismisses-google-books-copyright-infringement-case.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a class action copyright lawsuit against Google for their scanning and uploading of copyrighted materials for their Library Project.

In April, another copyright suit filed in the Southern District of New York by Viacom against YouTube was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-dismisses-viacom-copyright-suit-against-youtube.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge who decided that YouTube's hosting of video clips of Viacom programming was protected under the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> [text; pdf].</p>]]></content:encoded>

BP argued that the settlement should not be enforced as District Judge Carl Barbier for the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], who gave the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-proof-of-direct-causation-unnecessary-for-bp-oil-spill-claimants.php">initial ruling</a> [JURIST report], failed to determine if the claimants in the settlement included individuals who were not injured by the oil spill. The three-judge appellate panel for the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/default.aspx">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] decided that this was not sufficient grounds to invalidate the settlement and affirmed Barbier's ruling. "[C]lass certification is not precluded simply because a class may include persons who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct," the court stated in the majority opinion. BP has estimated the settlement will cost it about $7.8 billion.

<p>The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-rejects-judges-interpretation-of-bp-oil-spill-settlement.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an interpretation of the settlement terms in October. In September, <a href="http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/default.page">Halliburton</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/halliburton-pleads-guilty-to-tampering-with-bp-oil-spill-evidence.php">pleaded guilty to destroying evidence</a> [JURIST report] showing its connection to the oil spill. A federal judge in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/bp-ordered-to-pay-130-million-to-oil-spill-claims-administrator.php">ordered BP to pay $130 million</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.deepwaterhorizonsettlements.com/">gulf oil spill claim administration</a> [official website] under allegations of corruption in the disbursement process. The terms of BP's settlement have been one of the most hotly contested aspects of the case since the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bp-gulf-oil-spill-trial-opens.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in February. BP's former executive and two well-site supervisors <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges in November 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dieudonne was appealing the prohibition order issued by courts in Nantes and eight other cities. The court refused to lift the prohibition order after it had <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/09/french-court-comic-dieudonne-mbala-mbala-holocaust">originally been lifted</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] just hours before the state council decision. In a statement of the decision, the State Council noted the ruling was:<blockquote>Based on the risks posed to the projected performance of public order and breach of the principles in respect of which it is for the authorities of the State to ensure the prefect of the Loire Atlantic had not worn in the exercise of its administrative police powers, a serious and manifestly unlawful interference with a fundamental freedom.</blockquote>Supporters of Dieudonne claim that the performance is an exercise of free speech and expression and should be allowed to continue. Noting specifically that the act is meant only to be anti-Zionist and anti-establishment. However, those opposing the performance, including President Francois Hollande who has been <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140109-french-high-court-reinstates-ban-anti-semitic-comic-dieudonne/">vocal about his opposition</a> [France24 report], claim that the performance is simply "hate speech." A major concern of the performance surrounds the incorporation of <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20131230-france-quenelle-anti-semitism-anelka-dieudonne/">"reverse Nazi salute"</a> [France24 report] that has become increasingly controversial. 

<p>The anti-semitism and the freedom of expression in relation to the Holocaust continue to be controversial topics internationally. France has dealt with this issue over internet speech, which has generated much <a href="/hotline/2013/02/felix-treguer-twitter-france.php">discussion</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In November 2012, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] upheld an injunction preventing the activist group <a href="http://www.peta.org/">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) [advocacy website] from using <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/">Holocaust</a> [USHMM backgrounder] images in an animal rights poster campaign. A Canadian report in February 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/anti-semitic-incidents-on-rise-in.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that anti-semitism was rising in the population. That April, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-court-convicts-uk-bishop-for.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] a UK bishop for denying the Holocaust. Holocaust denial constitutes a crime under <a href="http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#130">Section 130 (3)</a> [text] of the German federal criminal code. As legislation is passed worldwide banning the denial of genocide, government's are increasingly being called to <a href="/forum/2012/02/vivian-curran-genocide-denial.php">balance freedom of expression and human rights</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Motorola Mobility, newly acquired by Google in the attempt to gain their patents, claimed on appeal that Apple had infringed on several of their patents, particularly one involving data delivery. The arguments centered around the functionality of the devices and how data is received by the respective phones. The appeals court noted in their opinion: <blockquote>Motorola had not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a causal connection between a change in accessibility of an application on the Droid 2 and a communication of the change in accessibility without any further intervening action by the user... As such, there was substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding that Motorola failed to satisfy the technical prong of the domestic industry requirement.</blockquote> This ruling is a blow to Google's claim to the patent and they are reportedly evaluating further action which could include attempting to take the case to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>Apple has been involved in several patent infringement cases, including a <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">dispute with Samsung</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last month, South Korea's Seoul Central District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/south-korea-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-dispute.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a Samsung claim against Apple attempting to ban the sale of certain Apple products. In November, a US jury <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/us-jury-awards-apple-290-million-in-patent-battle-with-samsung.php">awarded Apple $290.45 million</a> [JURIST report] following a re-trial on damages. The dispute with Motorola in the ITC <a href="/hotline/2013/05/sweetland-mcmanus-ITC-clears-Apple.php">has been the subject of debate</a> [JURIST op-ed] since it was decided last May. A jury originally awarded Apple a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion judgment </a>[JURIST report] against Samsung in 2012. However, Judge Lucy Koh r<a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-reduces-damages-award-that-samsung-must-pay-apple.php">educed the damages awarded</a> [JURIST report] by $450 million in March of last year because she found that the jury calculated damages for certain infringing Samsung products based on improper legal grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sharon suffered a major stroke in January of 2006, which placed him in a coma for the remainder of his life and resulted in a <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/israeli-pm-sharon-to-be-declared.php">declaration of official incapacitation</a> [JURIST report] while he was serving as PM. He was elected to serve as PM in 2001 and he held the post until his health removed him from the position in 2006. His coffin will lie in state at the Israeli parliament on Sunday and an official state ceremony will be held on Monday morning at the Knesset. Sharon was a military leader, but he was forced to resign as defense minister following his role in the <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/53050/World/Region/Remembering-Sabra--Shatila-The-death-of-their-worl.aspx">massacre of hundreds of Palestinian civilians</a> [<em>AhramOnline</em> report] in a conflict in Lebanon in 1982. He was a controversial figure internationally, but highly regarded as one of the most famous generals and politicians in Israel, where he was known as "the bulldozer" for his size and strong will. US President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/01/11/statement-president-passing-ariel-sharon">issued a statement</a> [press release] on Saturday to commend the life of Sharon.

<p>After Ariel Sharon's health began to decline, Sharon's son received attention for his role in campaign finance violations and fraud. Omri Sharon plead guilty and was <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/son-of-israeli-pm-sentenced-to-9.php">sentenced to nine months in jail for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. The following year, he earned a <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/son-of-former-israeli-pm-gets-reduced.php">reduced sentence on appeal</a>, but in 2008 the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/son-of-israel-ex-pm-to-serve-sentence.php">refused</a> to reduce his sentence further and he was forced to serve seven months for his crimes [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-842.htm">Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital</a> [docket materials], the court will consider whether a hedge fund could subpoena banks for information about Argentina's non-U.S. assets following the country's default on $100 billion in sovereign debt in 2002. The subpoenas were served in 2010 on <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> [corporate website] and <a href="http://www.bna.com.ar/">Banco de la Nacion Argentina</a> [corporate website, in Spanish], and sought documents relating to accounts or assets that Argentina might have at the banks. In August 2012, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Argentina's attempt to prevent bondholders from acquiring bank documents regarding the country's assets outside US territory, declaring that sovereign immunity was not an acceptable defense in this case. The Obama administration backed Argentina in the case. The Supreme Court will answer to a split between the Second Circuit, and the Seventh, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits, which have found that post-judgment subpoenas are potentially limited under the <a href="http://archive.usun.state.gov/hc_docs/hc_law_94_583.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> [text].

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-761.htm">POM Wonderful v. Coca-Cola</a> [docket materials], the Court will determine whether a rival company can file a federal suit to challenge a food or beverage label as misleading under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act">Lanham Act</a> [text]. <a href="http://www.pomwonderful.com/">Pom Wonderful</a> [corporate website] sued <a href="http://us.coca-cola.com/">Coca-Cola Co.</a> [corporate website] for allegedly deceiving consumers about the amount of pomegranate juice in one of its beverages, labeled as "Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices." Pom Wonderful contends that the label is misleading because the beverage contains less than one percent of pomegranate juice or blueberry juice. A federal appeals court barred the suit saying that <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] regulations authorize the beverage's name. The Court will determine whether the Lanham Act, which authorizes false-advertising suits, can apply to FDA regulated products. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-786.htm">Limelight Networks Ltd v. Akamai Technologies</a> [docket materials] the Court will determine whether a company can be held liable for inducing patent infringement even when no one company has committed direct patent infringement. <a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai Technologies Inc.</a> [corporate website] and the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> [official website] sued <a href="http://www.limelight.com/">Limelight Networks Inc.</a> [corporate website] over Akamai's patented method for redirecting requests for internet content to ensure access during periods of high demand. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] held that Akamai could sue Limelight even though no single company performed every aspect of the patented method. Akamai contends that Limelight takes all but one step of the patented process and induces its customers to perform the final step. <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco,</a>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/index.html">Oracle Corp.</a>, <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Inc</a>., <a href="http://www.symantec.com/index.jsp">Symantec Corp.</a> and <a href="http://www.xilinx.com/">Xilinx Inc</a>. [corporate websites] are backing Limelight, arguing that a decision for Akamai would leave technology companies vulnerable. The Obama administration is also urging the Supreme Court to rule for Limelight.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-193.htm">Susan B Anthony List v. Driehaus</a> [docket materials] the Court will rule on whether an Ohio law that imposes penalties for making knowingly false statements about political candidates violates the right to free speech. The Ohio law makes it a criminal offense to make knowingly or reckless false statements about a candidate, with a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and six months in prison. Despite never facing actual penalties, two conservative groups, <a href="http://www.sba-list.org/">Susan B. Anthony List</a> and <a href="http://coast-usa.blogspot.com/">the Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes</a> [advocacy websites], argue that the possibility that the Ohio statute would be enforced against them deterred them from issuing statements during the 2010 election campaign criticizing a Congressman Steven Driehaus for supporting President Obama's healthcare law. Lawyers for the state of Ohio say that the groups could not show that the law threatened their First Amendment right to free speech, or that they were likely to be prosecuted. A federal judge in Ohio dismissed the groups' challenge in 2011, and in May 2013 the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] upheld that decision. The Court will determine whether the two groups had grounds to challenge the law. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-301.htm">United States v. Clarke</a> [docket materials] the Court will determine whether an unsupported allegation that the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] issued a summons for an improper purpose entitles an opponent to an evidentiary hearing to question IRS officials on their reasons for issuing the summons. The case involves the IRS issuance of five summonses during an investigation into the tax liabilities of <a href="http://dynamoholdings.com/">Dynamo Holdings Ltd</a> [corporate website]. Those summoned, including Dynamo's chief financial officer Michael Clarke, contend that they were entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing before the district court granted the IRS's petitions to enforce the summonses. Clarke and the others argue that the IRS sought to enforce the summonses for an improper purpose, including in retribution for Dynamo's refusal to extend a statutes of limitations deadline. In April 2013, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/201213190.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of Clarke, stating that "in situations such as this, requiring the taxpayer to provide factual support for an allegation of an improper purpose, without giving the taxpayer a meaningful opportunity to obtain such facts, saddles the taxpayer with an unreasonable circular burden." </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-339.htm">CTS Corp. v. Waldburger</a> [docket materials] the Court will determine whether the discovery rule set forth in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-103">Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act</a> (CERCLA) [text] preempts a state's law limiting the time to seek remedies. The case arose after North Carolina landowners filed a claim against <a href="http://www.ctscorp.com/">CTS Corp.</a> [corporate website] for allegedly contaminating their well water with concentrated levels of chemicals with carcinogenic effects. Because the corporation has not had any operations at the site since it was sold in 1987, CTS argued that the case should be dismissed under North Carolina's 10-year limitation on the accrual of real property actions. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/121290.P.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that CERCLA does preempt state law, or else states could obliterate legitimate causes of action before they exist.  </p>

<p>The Court also agreed to hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-369.htm">Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc.</a> [docket materials], a long-running patent infringement case. <a href="http://www.biosiginstruments.com/">Biosig</a> sued <a href="http://www.nautilusinc.com/nautilus_incorporated/ourbrands.jsp">Nautilus</a> [corporate websites] in 2004, alleging that Nautilus infringed its patent for a heart rate monitor. A district court found Biosig's patent invalid because of "indefiniteness." However, the Federal Circuit reversed the lower court and found that the patent was clear and valid, as long as the ambiguity is not insoluble. The Court will determine whether ambiguous patent claims with multiple reasonable interpretations defeats the statutory requirement of particular and distinct patent claiming.</p>

<p>Oral arguments for the new cases are expected to be heard in April. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Amos, violence in the country has affected more than nine million of the country's 21 million population and many individuals face an immediate threat of starvation as humanitarian aid has been blocked by government or opposition forces for months. Amos finished a visit to the capital city of Damascus on Sunday, where she witnessed large scale displacement of citizens and an urgent need for basic humanitarian needs such as shelter and food. Many families are living in abandoned buildings or makeshift shelters and there is increasing concern regarding the health of children and the inability to provide aid. Amos spoke with the Syrian government to develop plans to reduce the impact of violence on civilians and find ways to improve humanitarian access.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to threaten the lives of millions of citizens in the country and refugees have emigrated to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq in alarming numbers since 2011. Last month the UN investigated the use of <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-finds-more-evidence-of-chemical-weapons-used-in-syria.php">chemical weapons</a> [JURIST report] in Syria and found credible evidence that several more attacks occurred than previously reported. Also last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-rights-chief-delivers-report-on-global-human-rights-progress.php">UN heightened its concern</a> [JURIST report] surrounding the country in a report on global rights progress, citing Syria and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CAR">Central African Republic</a> [JURIST news archive] as two major areas of instability. Earlier in December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported growing evidence of <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-rights-chief-syria-government-likely-committing-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Syria. In October, Amos <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-humanitarian-expert-urges-ceasefire-in-syria-for-evacuation-of-civilians.php">called for a cease fire</a> [JURIST report] in rural Damascus to allow humanitarian agencies to evacuate all remaining civilians and deliver medical aid to conflict areas.         </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to reports, the court also handed down sentences ranging from three to 12 years to 10 other co-defendants convicted of lesser offenses, including financing the attack and sheltering those involved. Reports indicate that the attack stemmed from a 2003 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] initiative, which <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/12/us-saudi-sentence-idUSBREA0B0L320140112">sought to interfere</a> [Reuters report] with relations between the US and Saudi Arabia. The accused reportedly have 30 days to appeal their sentences.

<p>Saudi Arabia's justice system has drawn international criticism in recent years, especially with regard to its high number of executions. Last month a Saudi criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-defendant-to-death-for-attack-on-us-consulate.php">sentenced a militant to death</a> [JURIST report] for his role in an attack on the US Consulate in Jeddah in 2004. In 2008 Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/saudi-execution-rate-connected-to.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] linking large number of executions in Saudi Arabia to flaws in the Saudi judicial system. In a report released earlier that year, AI found that Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-1200-people-executed-worldwide-in.php">executed more people per capita than any other nation</a> [JURIST report]. According to that report, at least 12,52 people were put to death in 24 countries in 2008, with Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Pakistan and the US accounting for the vast majority of the executions. In July 2008 Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report criticizing a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">lack of legal protections</a> [JURIST report] for the 1.5 million migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia. Among other proposed reforms, HRW called on the Saudi government to amend the 2005 Labor Law to cover migrant workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to reports, the complaint <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-devastating-dossier-on-abuse-by-uk-forces-in-iraq-goes-to-international-criminal-court-9053735.html">primarily alleges</a> [<em>The Independent</em> report] that UK service personnel, at the behest of their superiors within the UK government, abused and, in some instances, "willfully killed" Iraqi detainees in violation of the <a href="http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. Several government officials have reportedly denied the accusations and pledged that the matters will be, or already have been, investigated and resolved internally. The official PIL and ECCHR report, which sets forth the allegations in detail based upon the testimony of hundreds of Iraqis, will reportedly be released to the public Tuesday at the Law Society in London.

<p>The <a href="/feature/2013/07/war-crimes-allegations.php">Iraq War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was plagued with accusations of war crimes and atrocities, aimed at the different parties and countries involved in the conflict. In September 2012 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/nobel-laureate-urges-prosecution-of-bush-blair-for-iraq-war-crimes.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for former US president George W. Bush and former UK prime minister Tony Blair to stand trial at the ICC for their roles in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In November 2011 Malaysian Kuala Lumpur Foundation to Criminalise War (KLFCW) found Bush and Blair guilty of war crimes after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/malaysia-rights-group-finds-bush-blair-guilty-of-war-crimes-in-symbolic-trial.php">symbolic trial</a> [JURIST report], in which the duo was found guilty on charges in connection to the invasion of Iraq. During that same timeframe a UK appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uk-appeals-court-rules-body-investigating-iraq-abuse-lacks-independence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a special commission charged with investigating the alleged abuse of Iraqi civilians in British-controlled detention facilities between March 2003 and December 2008 lacked independence. The Court of Appeals ordered Defence Secretary Liam Fox to reconsider his refusal to open a single public inquiry into allegations of UK military abuse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement came as <a href="http://mobi.enca.com/south-africa/nkandla-public-violence-case-postponed">30 of his supporters</a> [eNCA report], three minors and 27 adults, were expected to appear in the Nkandla Magistrate Court for throwing stones at members of the <a href="http://effighters.org.za/">Economic Freedom Fighters</a> (EFF) [party website] near Zuma's private home on Saturday. After appearing, the arrested supporters were granted bail of R500 each and the minors were released to their guardians. The trial has been postponed until February 18, according to the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> (NPA) [official website]. The president has also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/safrica-leader-says-no-violence-against-opposition/2014/01/13/68c21c36-7c49-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html">stated</a> [AP report] that the ANC does not approve of taking violent action against people who are exercising their democratic rights and that the governing body recommits to free political activity throughout the country.

<p>This is not the only story pairing the ANC and controversy in recent years. In 2011 the group, which holds the majority in the South African National Assembly, was responsible for pushing through a<a href="/paperchase/2011/11/south-africa-lawmakers-approve-controversial-secrecy-bill.php"> controversial state secrets bill</a> [JURIST report] designed to protect state secrets related to national security. Earlier that year, a South African Court found the ANC Youth League President Julius Malema, the current leader of the EFF, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/south-africa-court-finds-anc-party-leader-guilty-of-hate-speech.php">guilty </a>[JURIST report] of hate speech for singing the apartheid-era protest song "Shoot the Boer." In 2010 the Vienna-based International Press Institute (IPI) <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/press-group-south-africa-media-tribunal-threat-to-journalism.php">sent an open letter</a> [JURIST report] to President Zuma expressing concerns over plans by the ANC to create a special court to punish press outlets that publish sensitive state information. In 2009 Zuma, serving as ANC leader, called on the Judicial Service Commission to <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/south-africa-congressional-leader-zuma.php">conduct a review</a> [JURIST report] of the country's Constitutional Court, saying the court had too much power and abused its authority. These claims came shortly after the NPA announced that it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/south-africa-prosecuters-drop-anc.php">dropping corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] filed against Zuma in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20140113/af--liberia-minister-suspended/?utm_hp_ref=sports&ir=sports">cited Tah's decision</a> [AP report] to grant "compassionate release" to journalist Rodney Sieh, who was jailed last year in connection with a libel case, as the reason for its ruling and her suspension. In 2010, Sieh's newspaper <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/liberia-supreme-court-suspends-justice-minister/2014/01/13/869b0db6-7c4a-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html">printed allegations</a> [AP report] that Agriculture Minister Chris Toe's ministry could not account for millions of dollars, leading Toe to file a libel claim against the journalist. Sieh was jailed in August after failing to produce the USD $1.5 million that Toe was awarded by the court. The justice minister allowed the journalist to be released for 30 days in October after he was hospitalized with malaria, which critics say was not compatible with Liberian law. Toe withdrew his claim in November. The Supreme Court called Sieh's release a <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201401110001.html?page=2">disregard of the court's order</a> [allAfrica report], despite the fact that his right to seek medical treatment while in prison was not surrendered. 

<p>There have been many recent controversies involving imprisonment of and danger to journalists throughout the world. In December, the Committee to Protect Journalists <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-deadliest-nations-for-journalists.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] finding Syria the most dangerous nation in the world for journalists, with Egypt and Iraw just behind. Also in December, Egyptian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egyptian-authorities-detain-al-jazeera-journalists.php">detained </a>[JURIST report] four journalists working for the Al Jazeera English news channel. The journalists have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gB3F5GLHW0qVnK8GiIdp1nsRqCuw?docId=7ea83e76-a27e-4aad-ad17-b365e775ad78">been accused</a> [AFP report] of broadcasting illegally, spreading false information and information aimed at inciting the public, and meeting with members of the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website, JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>], an Islamist group that was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Egypt-government-declares-Muslim-Brotherhood-a-terrorist-group.php">classified as a terrorist organization</a> [JURIST report] by the Egyptian government.

Isaacson</a> [docket], bypassing its opportunity to rule on Arizona's new ban of abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy. In 2012, the state defended the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/adopted/s.2036jud.pdf">statute</a> [text, PDF] by arguing that this stricter regulation would reduce the fetus' likelihood to feel pain and decrease health risks for the women. However, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last May that the Arizona law violates women's rights, making it "per se unconstitutional." The Supreme Court's decision on the Arizona case would have given clarity on whether state legislatures were permitted to ban abortions at earlier stages in a woman's pregnancy. Significantly, it would have provided guidance on whether viability is still considered the medical threshold for state bans as determined by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&navby=case&vol=410&invol=113">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion]. No comment was given by the court to provide an explanation for the refusal to hear the appeal.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. In November Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne asked the Supreme Court to reconsider a controversial Arizona law that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/arizona-ag-asks-us-supreme-court-to-reinstate-abortion-law.php">strip Medicaid funding</a> [JURIST report] from doctors and clinics that perform abortions. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-arizona-race-based-abortion-law.php">dismissed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Arizona's race based abortion laws. In October 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined to reconsider</a> its August decision to allow Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">defund Planned Parenthood</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law that would block Medicaid funding for abortion providers earlier that same month. In August the Fifth Circuit upheld Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">revoke an abortion clinic's license</a> [JURIST report] immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. That same month a Kansas judge<a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-lawsuit-challenging-abortion-clinic-regulations.php"> refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's new abortion clinic regulations after state officials asked that they be upheld without a trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1281_d1o2.pdf">NLRB v. Noel Canning</a>  [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-recess-appointments.php">report</a>] the court will decide: (1) whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised during a recess that occurs within a session of the Senate or is instead limited to recesses that occur between enumerated sessions of the Senate; and (2) whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised to fill vacancies that exist during a recess or is instead limited to vacancies that first arose during that recess. The court also requested the parties argue a third question: whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in <em>pro forma</em> sessions. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last January that the recess appointment of three members of the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] by President Barack Obama was unconstitutional, and the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/obama-petitions-supreme-court-on-recess-appointments.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report]. The case has generated some <a href="/forum/2014/01/victor-williams-nlrb-recess.php">controversy</a> over the <a href="/dateline/2013/02/ilan-wurming-recess-appointments.php">powers</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the president and the courts.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-5196_6j36.pdf">Law v. Seigel</a> [transcript, PDF] the court will consider whether a bankruptcy trustee may surcharge a debtor's constitutionally protected homestead property. Stephen Law filed for and was granted <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Chapter7.aspx">Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a> [US Courts backgrounder] but had defrauded the bankruptcy court during the proceedings. The court granted Law's bankruptcy trustee, Alan Seigel, a request to revoke exempting Law's protected assets from consideration in payment of the administrative expenses. Law argues that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522">&#167; 522</a> [text] of the Bankruptcy Code shows a congressional intent to exempt certain assets from bankruptcy collection, regardless of whether the debtor has acted in bad faith. Siegel contends that bankruptcy courts may revoke such exemptions to prevent abuses of the judicial process. The bankruptcy court permitted the surcharge, which was then affirmed by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/bap/">Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], and ultimately also <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Law_v_Siegel_In_re_Law_435_Fed_Appx_697_9th_Cir_2011_Court_Opinio">affirmed</a> [opinion] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> had <a href="http://isysweb.ca4.uscourts.gov/isysquery/648c75f2-bd62-47fc-8dcb-eea2447bed7a/1/doc/111479.P.pdf#xml=http://New-ISYS/isysquery/648c75f2-bd62-47fc-8dcb-eea2447bed7a/1/hilite/">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court's dismissal of Samantar's claim that, as a foreign official, he had common-law immunity for acts performed on behalf of a foreign state despite allegations that those acts violated international law. Thus Samantar could be held liable for human rights abuses related to the killing and torture of members of the Isaaq clan in Somalia throughout the 1980s under former dictator Siad Barre. The Supreme Court did not comment on why it denied the appeal. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision to deny <em>certiorari</em>.

<p>This is the latest step in a case that has lasted nine years and gone through several different court systems. A judge for the US <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] on originally awarded $21 million to seven Somalis in a lawsuit against Samantar in August 2012. The Somalis bringing the lawsuit, some of whom fled to the US and some of whom stayed in Somalia, claimed to have been subjected to torture or potential executions at the hands of the Barre regime and brought the lawsuit under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350, text].

Ohio no longer has access to its former execution drug, pentobarbital, since its manufacturer prohibited its use for executions. McGuire's counsel <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-new-execution-method-causes-suffering-death-row-inmate.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the substituted two-drug lethal injection will not sedate McGuire instantaneously, but may leave him conscious and suffering from "air hunger" for up to five minutes. The state presented evidence to dispute the claims of alleged "air hunger" and argued against any delay of proceedings. Ruling that the evidence failed to prove a substantial risk of severe pain to McGuire, the judge found that the new injection will not constitute a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder].

<p>Ohio is one of many states to recently suffer a shortage of execution drug supply. The shortage of sodium thiopental, a drug used in the lethal injection process, in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol. In August a state judge in Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arkansas-judge-rules-part-of-execution-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law provision allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections violates the constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. In March of last year, two Texas inmates <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [USA Today report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/us/02lethal.html?_r=0">Kentucky and Tennessee surrendered supplies of sodium thiopental</a> [NYT report] to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) after the agency seized Georgia's supply in order to investigate whether the drug was properly imported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdulmutallab was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-court-sentences-accused-plane-bomber-to-life-imprisonment.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to life in prison in February 2012 after pleading guilty to all charges stemming from an unsuccessful attempt to detonate a bomb in his underwear while on Northwest Airlines flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Abdulmutallab challenged his sentence and conviction, claiming that a life sentence on those charges constituted cruel and unusual punishment, and additionally alleging that he should not have been allowed to plea guilty or represent himself while there were questions as to his competency to stand trial. The Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/13/us-underwear-bomber-idUSBREA0C17920140113">rejected these and other arguments</a> [Reuters report], stating that Abdulmutallab was an "adept and educated individual" who understood his actions and the charges against him, and that a life sentence was not disproportional, given that Abdulmutallab expressed continued motivation to commit terrorist attacks against the US.

<p>Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/attempted-plane-bomber-pleads-guilty-to-all-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in October 2012 against the advice of his attorney, after initially entering <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">not-guilty pleas</a> [JURIST report] on all charges in 2010. In September 2010 Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/accused-plane-bomber-fires-lawyers-inquires-about-possible-guilty-plea.php">fired his lawyer</a> [JURIST report] and decided to represent himself. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-files-charges-in-attempted-detroit.php">initiated by US authorities</a> [JURIST report] on December 26, 2009. Following Abdulmutallab's attempted bombing, numerous additional safety measures were put in place in regards to US air travel. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-outlines-measures-taken-following.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in December of 2009 that officials would increase screening requirements as well as the number of air marshals aboard flights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kenyan authorities have been <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201401140377.html">assembling nearby</a> [<em>allAfrica</em> report] to enforce evictions ordered by the government in pursuit of its forest and water conservation objectives.

The voting law, which has been widely criticized for making election results uncertain, was ruled unconstitutional for its provisions that granted major benefits to the winners of House elections. But the judgment did not declare the currently elected parliament to be invalid. "Parliament is fully legitimate," stated Italian <a href="http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/lingue/en/en-nap-biografia.htm">President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official profile]. "The court itself does not call that into doubt." Italian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22285883">Premier Enrico Letta</a> [BBC profile] has made electoral reform a top priority and he hopes to reform the Senate this year to have lesser lawmaking capabilities than the house.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/italy-high-court-holds-part-of-election-law-unconstitutional.php">initial ruling</a> [JURIST report] that held parts of the electoral law unconstitutional was made on December 4.

This comes after Berlusconi was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/italy-court-orders-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-for-corruption.php">ordered to stand trial</a> for allegedly bribing a rival party senator to step down and his October 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] for tax fraud. Five days after Berlusconi's conviction, Italy <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/italy-passes-anti-corruption-law.php">passed anti-corruption legislation</a> [JURIST report] calling for harsher penalties on government officials engaged in corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bauman</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that <a href="http://www.daimler.com">DaimlerChrysler AG</a> (Daimler) [company website] does not have to face suit in California for alleged human rights violations by a subsidiary that took place entirely in Argentina. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-allows-argentine-suit-against-daimler-ag-for-involvement-in-dirty-war.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Barbara Bauman, who represented 21 Argentine residents, allowing them to bring suit for the actions of <a href="http://www.mercedes-benz.com.ar/content/argentina/mpc/mpc_argentina_website/es/home_mpc/passengercars.html">Mercedes-Benz Argentina</a> (MB Argentina) [corporate website, in Spanish], a Daimler subsidiary, during the nation's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>]. The plaintiffs claim that MB Argentina collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture and kill certain MB Argentina workers that are either named as plaintiffs or were closely related to the plaintiffs. They argue that business activities in California by Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) as a subsidiary of Daimler should permit the filing of a lawsuit because of an important agency relationship between MBUSA and Daimler, but the Supreme Court held that Daimler is not amenable to suit in California for injuries allegedly caused by conduct of MB Argentina that took place entirely outside the US. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg delivered the opinion of the court:<blockquote>If Daimler's California activities sufficed to allow adjudication of this Argentina-rooted case in California, the same global reach would presumably be available in every other State in which MBUSA's sales are sizable. Such exorbitant exercises of all-purpose jurisdiction would scarcely permit out-of-state defendants "to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit." ... It was therefore error for the Ninth Circuit to conclude that Daimler, even with MBUSA's contacts attributed to it, was at home in California, and hence subject to suit there on claims by foreign plaintiffs having nothing to do with anything that occurred or had its principal impact in California. ... The Ninth Circuit, moreover, paid little heed to the risks to international comity its expansive view of general jurisdiction posed.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-affirmative-action-suing-foreign-corporations.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in October. In general, there was a sense <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/10/academic-highlight-vanderbilt-law-review-roundtable-on-daimlerchrysler-ag-v-bauman/">among academics and legal scholars</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that the Ninth Circuit ruling may have gone too far in granting jurisdiction in the case. Nevertheless, uncertainty surrounding the case persisted because <a href="/forum/2013/11/stan-cox-personal-jurisdiction.php">scholars recognized</a> [JURIST op-ed] the Supreme Court had not yet developed a principled rationale for general personal jurisdiction in prior case law and questions remained following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules.php">Goodyear v.

Hood v. AU Optronics Corp.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the lawsuit in question is not a "mass action" suit under the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ2/html/PLAW-109publ2.htm">Class Action Fairness Act</a> (CAFA) [text] of 2005, reversing the previous <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16945130566545382149&q=Mississippi+ex+rel.+Hood+v.+AU+Optronics+Corp.,+701+F.3d+796+%285th+Cir.+2012%29+&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. CAFA allows "mass action" suits, which it defines as those in which 100 or more persons are named as plaintiffs, to be removed from state to federal court. Previously both the district and circuit courts hearing the case found it to be a "mass action" under the CAFA because Mississippi was bringing the suit on the behalf of a large number of its citizens. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the "100 or more persons" phrase of the CAFA was not intended to encompass counting of unnamed persons with an interest in the claim, and since Mississippi is the only plaintiff named in the suit it is not a mass action. In its reasoning the court stated that to expand the definition of "plaintiff" to include unnamed parties with a real interest in the suit would distort the definition of the term to an unrecognizable degree. Construing "plaintiff" to include not just the named parties to a suit but also any person who might benefit from the claim would create an "administrative nightmare" that Congress clearly could not have intended. The result is a failure of federal jurisdiction mandating that the case be remanded to state court to be tried on the merits. 

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-legislative-prayer-class-actions.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-class-actions-federal-and-state-laws.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] another case relating to CAFA last January in <span class="casename">The Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Knowles</span>, which presented the question of whether a class of persons under the CAFA can avoid a removal of the case to federal court if the amount claimed by each plaintiff is less than the statutorily stated amount of $75,000. The court ruled on the case in March, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-rules-on-class-action-jurisdiction-issue.php">holding</a> [JURIST report] that a stipulation to keep damages below a certain amount by a single plaintiff is not enough to bind the whole class named in the suit. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of the new constitution view the referendum as a grand democratic move and the document itself as vesting them with new rights previously unrecognized. However, critics have claimed that the referendum is more about vindicating Morsi's removal than changing the internal political situation, and also claim that the proposed constitution disproportionately favors the military at the expense of the people. This is the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/01/egyptians-vote-constitutional-referendum-201411431750970367.html">first</a> [Al Jazeera report] ballot since Morsi's removal in July. The new constitution is based on the 1971 constitution, though it <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/01/what-egypt-proposed-new-constitution-201411312385987166.html">contains</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder] some key differences.

<p>The Egyptian Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-assembly-finalizes-draft-constitution-raises-election-concerns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the finalized draft of the new constitution in December&#51;a secular-based document reflecting a shift in policy from the strongly Islamist-leaning document approved under former President Morsi. In November the referendum on the constitution, although originally scheduled for December, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-to-delay-constitutional-referendum-by-one-month.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until January to allow the Assembly more time to complete amendments to the document. The previous constitution has been in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">suspension</a> [JURIST report] since Morsi's removal in July. That document was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-opposition-to-appeal-constitutional-referendum.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by referendum in December 2012, although its opponents appealed its adoption, alleging that its approval was obtained through widespread fraud and irregularities in the administration of the voting. Despite the opposition's allegations, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed</a> the former constitution into law only three days later. It is yet unclear what changes this proposed new constitution will bring to Egypt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was filed by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the advocacy group <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org">Compassion &#38; Choices</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of two doctors and a terminally ill cancer patient against the District Attorney for the Second Judicial District, <a href="http://2nd.nmdas.com">Kari Brandenberg</a> [official website], and the Attorney General for the state of New Mexico, <a href="http://www.nmag.gov">Gary King</a> [official website]. The ruling comes after a two-day bench trial held in December, where plaintiffs argued that doctors in New Mexico should be permitted to write prescriptions for terminally ill patients who wish to end their lives. The 50-year-old patient in this case is suffering from advanced uterine cancer. In the opinion, Nash highlighted the importance of upholding New Mexico's constitutional commitment to the advancement of life, liberty, safety and happiness, stating, "this Court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying." As a consequence of the ruling, the court granted plaintiffs the requested injunctive relief prohibiting defendants from prosecuting physicians who provide aid in dying. The attorney general's office <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/14/justice/new-mexico-assisted-suicide/">announced</a> [CNN report]  that it will analyze the decision to see if it will file an appeal.

<p>Monday's ruling makes New Mexico the fifth state in the US to allow the practice of aid in dying for terminally ill patients, and the issue of one's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has garnered attention both in the US and around the world in recent years. An October ruling from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/canada-law-against-doctor-assisted-suicide-is-upheld.php">upheld Canada's law</a> [JURIST report] against doctor-assisted suicide, which has <a href="/dateline/2013/11/jason-huang-assisted-suicide.php">invigorated the debate</a> [JURIST op-ed] surrounding the right to die. In May the governor of <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/vermont-governor-signs-physician-assisted-suicide-bill.php">Vermont signed</a> [JURIST report] signed the "Death With Dignity" bill into law. Also last spring the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-high-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-has-no-right-to-assisted-suicide.php">Republic of Ireland rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a paralyzed woman seeking to allow her partner to aid in her suicide. In 2010 the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">Montana high court ruled</a> [JURIST report] physician assisted suicide is not banned by state law.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 63-page opinion, Judge David Tatel explained how the regulations impermissibly required providers to serve the public indiscriminately, leaving companies like Verizon and AT&#38;T, after having spent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/technology/appeals-court-rejects-fcc-rules-on-internet-service-providers.html?_r=0">billions of dollars</a> [NYT report] building their infrastructures, with little room to manage the networks. The court further explained the concerns of the FCC as they attempt to regulate an ever-growing industry, focusing on the relationship between edge providers, companies like Amazon or YouTube that provide content and services, and broadband providers like Verizon:<blockquote>[Proponents of net neutrality] fear that broadband providers might prevent their end-user subscribers from accessing certain edge providers altogether, or might degrade the quality of their end-user subscribers' access to certain edge providers, either as a means of favoring their own competing content or services or to enable them to collect fees from certain edge providers. Thus, for example, a broadband provider like Comcast might limit its end-user subscribers' ability to access the <em>New York Times</em> website if it wanted to spike traffic to its own news website, or it might degrade the quality of the connection to a search website like Bing if a competitor like Google paid for prioritized access.</blockquote> While it is unclear how the FCC will respond, FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler said in a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-wheeler-statement-court-opinion-open-interne">statement</a> [text] that the agency will consider all options, including an appeal. 

<p>Internet providers have challenged the FCC's net neutrality rules in the past. In April 2011 the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-fcc-net-neutrality-rules.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the FCC to dismiss a challenge to the new net neutrality rules. In January 2011 MetroPCS, the fifth-largest cell phone company in the US, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging net neutrality rules. In 2010 the DC Circuit also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the FCC's net neutrality rules in the case of <span class="casename">Comcast v. FCC</span>, holding that the FCC lacks authority to require broadband providers to treat all Internet traffic equally. Following the <span class="casename">Comcast</span> decision, some have <a href="/hotline/2009/09/dc-circuits-ruling-in-comcast-case.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that because providers, and cable operators in particular, have never possessed bottleneck monopoly power previously that the FCC should be more willing to avoid placing restrictions on them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1200_f29g.pdf">Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-recess-appointments.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on: (1) whether Article III permits the exercise of the judicial power of the US by bankruptcy courts on the basis of litigant consent, and, if so, whether "implied consent" based on a litigant's conduct, where the statutory scheme provides the litigant no notice that its consent is required, is sufficient to satisfy Article III; and (2) whether a bankruptcy judge may submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for <em>de novo</em> review by a district court in a "core" proceeding under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/157">28 USC &#167; 157(b)</a> [text]. In <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-narrows-bankruptcy-judge-jurisdiction.php">Stern v. Marshall</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court held that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III of the US Constitution</a> [text] precludes Congress from assigning certain "core" bankruptcy proceedings involving private state law rights to adjudication by non-Article III bankruptcy judges. Applying <span class="casename">Stern</span>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10911566478125268142&q=Executive+Benefits+Insurance+Agency,+Inc.+v.+Arkison&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that a fraudulent conveyance action is subject to Article III. The court further held that the Article III problem had been waived by petitioner's litigation conduct and that a bankruptcy court may issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to a district court's <em>de novo</em> review, in "core" bankruptcy proceedings where Article III precludes the bankruptcy court from entering final judgment. In Tuesday's oral arguments, counsel for the petitioner argued that the initial judgment in favor of the respondent had been "entered by a non-Article 3 bankruptcy court pursuant to a statute that this Court has declared unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers." Counsel for the respondent argued that 28 USC &#167; 157(b) allows district courts to refer issues to bankruptcy judges, who may then "hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or judgment," in an attempt to convince the court to let the Ninth Circuit's ruling stand. Counsel for the US also argued on the respondent's behalf.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1173_7lh8.pdf">Brandt Revocable Trust v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-adds-8-cases-to-docket.php?edition=world">report</a>] the court heard arguments regarding the General Railroad Right-of-Way Act of 1875 (1875 Act) and specifically, the question, "[d]id the United States retain an implied reversionary interest in 1875 Act rights-of-way after the underlying lands were patented into private ownership?" The Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7805902297301602875&q=Great+Northern+Ry.+Co.+v.+United+States&hl=en&as_sdt=4,60&as_vis=1">Great Northern Ry. Co. v. United States</a> (1942) [opinion] that rights-of-way are easements and not limited fees with an implied reversionary interest. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the US did retain an implied reversionary interest in 1875 Act rights-of-way after the underlying lands were patented into private ownership, creating a circuit split. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the Tenth Circuit's ruling is inconsistent with both the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">Great Northern</span> as well as with the "Department of Interior's longstanding interpretation that the 1875 Act granted only an easement." Counsel for the respondent, however, argued that the legislative history and the "surrounding statutory context" of the 1875 Act, which predated the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">Great Northern</span>, both show that the US "retains the reversionary interest in the surface of the land of right-of-ways granted to railroads."</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1408_197d.pdf">United States v. Quality Stores</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-adds-8-cases-to-docket.php?edition=world">report</a>] the court heard arguments on "[w]hether severance payments made to employees whose employment was involuntarily terminated are taxable under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-C/chapter-21">Federal Insurance Contributions Act</a> [26 USC &#167; 3101 et seq]." The Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Quality_Stores_Inc_In_re_Quality_Stores_Inc_693_F">held</a> [opinion] that such payments are not taxable. Counsel for the petitioner argued that "[t]he payments in this case fall squarely under FICA's definition of wages, which includes all remuneration for employment." Counsel for respondents, however, in an attempt to have the court affirm the Sixth Circuit's decision, argued that the US government has agreed with the fact that only certain supplemental unemployment benefits are wages and therefore covered under FICA. Counsel for respondents further argued that the supplemental unemployment benefits in this case are not a form of remuneration, as their receipt is contingent upon the recipient's loss of a job. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Article II section 35 of the <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/ok_constitution.html">Oklahoma Constitution</a> [text] enacted in 2004 by <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/711.pdf">State Question No. 711</a> [text, PDF] defines marriage in Oklahoma as "consist[ing] only of the union of one man and one woman." Judge Terence Kern found that the Oklahoma Constitutional Amendment deprives a class of Oklahoma citizens of equal protection of the law, characterizing the ban as "an arbitrary, irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a governmental benefit." The decision has been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/us/federal-judge-rejects-oklahomas-gay-marriage-ban.html?_r=0">stayed</a> [NYT report] pending an anticipated appeal by the state of Oklahoma to the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website]. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an intensely debated issue in the US.

Earlier this month the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in Utah was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocked</a> by the US Supreme Court after the <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/">Utah Attorney General</a> [official website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">application for stay</a> [JURIST reports] with the court.

In addition to charges of aiding terrorist the men face charges of being in the country illegally and obtaining false identification documents.

The <a href="https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/signature/2012/ctc_4-11d.pdf">Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications Procedure</a> [text] permits children or their representatives to submit formal complaints to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRD), upon which the CRD must review the allegations and decide whether to take action. If a rights violation is found to have the proper grounds, the CRD must then recommend to the nation at issue specific and mandatory procedures to remedy the violations. According to the UN, the Protocol effectively places children on equal legal footing with adults with respect to several international treaties. On Monday Costa Rica became the 10th nation to ratify the Protocol, thereby giving it legal effect.

<p>Childrens' rights continues to be an important issue across the globe. In November the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/children-suffer-trauma-from-syrian-war-un-rights-experts.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a 60-page multimedia report that Syrian refugee children are suffering trauma from the Syrian Civil War, which has killed over 120,000 people. The report stated that many Syrian refugee children in Jordan and Lebanon are growing up in broken families, lacking education and serving as a household's primary source of income. Also in November a UN independent rights expert called on the Benin government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/benin-government-must-better-protect-children-un-rights-expert.php">better protect the rights of children</a> [JURIST report] after a visit to the country reportedly revealed widespread abuse and exploitation. In September Sweden's Ombudsman for Children Fredrik Malmberg called for the country to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sweden-childrens-rights-official-calls-for-ban-on-infant-male-circumcision.php">ban infant male circumcision</a> [JURIST report], claiming the practice violates the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Also in September UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-urges-ratification-of-childrens-rights-convention.php">urged member states to ratify</a> [JURIST report] the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its three optional protocols at the 2013 treaty event held at its New York headquarters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Central Pension Fund</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that, whether a claim for attorney's fees is based upon a statute, a private contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent a merits judgment from becoming "final" for purposes of appeal. Before 2007, petitioners Ray Haluch Gravel Company (Haluch) entered into a collective bargaining agreement with respondents Central Pension Fund (CPF), pursuant to which Haluch was required to pay attorney's fees and costs in the event of a default. Haluch defaulted, and CPF filed suit in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts. During the suit CPF sought an extension with respect to their petition for attorney's fees and costs, and, before the district court ruled on it, the court ruled in their favor regarding the merits. CPF, dissatisfied with the merits ruling, filed a notice of appeal within 30 days of the eventual ruling on fees and costs, but more than 30 days after the merits ruling. Haluch argued CPF's appeal was, therefore, untimely pursuant to federal law requiring appeal from the "final" judgment within 30 days. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit disagreed on grounds that the attorney's fees provision within the CBA was part of the merits decision. Writing for the unanimous court, Justice Anthony Kennedy reversed the First Circuit's decision, concluding that CPF's notice of appeal was untimely and that there is no distinction between a grant of fees by contact and by statute for purposes of determining when a judgment is "final."

<p>The effect of attorney's fees and costs provisions within statutes and private agreements is often litigated. In May the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-on-attorneys-fees-under-vaccine-act.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an untimely National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 petition may qualify for an award of attorney's fees if it is filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis for its claim. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-rules-debt-collection-law-allows-attorneys-fees-for-good-faith-filing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) allows fees to be awarded in Fair Debt Collection Practices Act even if the suit was brought in good faith. In April 2010 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-attorneys-fees-may.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that calculations of an attorney's fee based on the lodestar may be increased due to superior performance, but only in extraordinary circumstances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The draft law would have provided lawmakers and government officials <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/romania-court-rules-immunity-law-unconstitutional/2014/01/15/f236abba-7de0-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html">immunity from prosecution</a> [AP report] in corruption cases while in office. The legislation was passed by Romanian lawmakers on December 9. However, the US, along with the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Romanian president Traian Basescu and opposition lawmakers criticized the vote, calling the law "a step away from transparency and rule-of-law."

The CNIL <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/france-data-authorities-fine-google-for-non-compliance-with-privacy-policy.php">imposed the fine on Google</a> [JURIST report] last week after the company failed to act on the Commission's order to bring its methods of tracking and storing user information into compliance with French data privacy law. In addition to the fine, CNIL <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/08/us-france-google-fine-idUSBREA0719U20140108">ordered</a> [Reuters report] Google to post the decision on its French homepage for 48 hours within eight days of being officially notified of the ruling.

<p>Google has faced international criticism for alleged privacy violations. In November, the <a href="http://www.dutchdpa.nl/Pages/home.aspx">Dutch Data Protection Authority</a> (DPA) [official website] stated that Google was in <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/netherlands-say-google-violates-data-protection-laws.php">violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's data protection act.

"A lack of political will and unacceptable court delays are allowing Haiti's former 'president-for-life," Jean-Claude Duvalier to escape justice for human rights violations," <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] said in a joint statement. Haitian authorities reopened a criminal case against Duvalier three years ago after he returned to the country from a 25-year exile in France. The charges against Duvalier include murder and torture of political opponents and corruption. However, the case has been stalled for almost a year. AI's special advisor to regional programs Javier Zuniga stated: "It appears that the Haitian authorities have no intention of carrying out thorough investigations into Duvalier-era abuses. The judicial process has stalled, denying victims of his reign of terror their right to truth, justice, and reparation. To add insult to injury, Duvalier continues to take part in public events, often at the invitation of the Haitian government." Testimony for the appeal concluded last May, and the Court of Appeals has yet to release a decision. "Under Duvalier and his Tonton Macoutes militia, thousands were tortured, killed, and hundreds of thousands of Haitians fled into exile," said Reed Brody, counsel and spokesperson at HRW. "Duvalier's victims shouldn't have to keep waiting and hoping for justice that never comes."

<p>Last March Duvalier <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-haiti-dictator-appears-before-court-after-fourth-summons.php">appeared before a Haitian court</a> [JURIST report] for the first time after previously rebuffing summonses for alleged human rights abuses from 1971-1986. The lawyer for the plaintiffs criticized the previously rebuffed summonses as evidence of Haiti's failing justice system. The legal proceedings began with Duvalier's lawyer requesting that the proceedings take place behind closed doors. The summons followed a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/02/haiti-court-orders-former-president-duvalier-to-appear-at-human-rights-hearing.php">previous order</a> [JURIST report] from nearly two weeks ago by a Haitian appeals court for Duvalier to appear for the hearings, a directive which the ex-president failed to follow]. Duvalier returned to Haiti in 2011 after 25 years in exile, prompting an investigation for crimes committed from 1971-1986. In January 2012 a magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">dismissed human rights charges against Duvalier</a> [JURIST report], including allegations of rape, torture and murder, on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the UN report, there has been a recent spike in extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, mutilations, enforced disappearances and other rights abuses in CAR. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned that the situation in CAR remains "extremely volatile" despite recent reconciliation efforts and warned the CAR's government to respect human rights in responding to the situation. Pillay plans to provide a fuller account of the UN's findings during a special session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva later this month.

<p>There has been growing international concern over gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150044">seized the nations capital</a> [BBC backgrounder] in March of 2013.

The Trial Chamber enjoys discretion under Article 63(1) of the <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], which states that "[t]he accused shall be present during the trial." However, in October the <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/icc-kenya-leader-not-excused-from-attending-trial.php">Appeals Chamber determined</a> [JURIST report] that "such discretion is limited and must be exercised with caution." The Appeals Chamber ultimately concluded that the Trial Chamber exercised its discretion too broadly when it <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-grants-kenya-vps-request-to-skip-parts-of-upcoming-trial.php">initially granted Ruto's request</a> [JURIST report] to miss parts of his trial. The Trial Chamber will now require Ruto to complete a waiver requesting the ability to miss portions of his trial. The court will also require Ruto to be present for certain upcoming parts of his trial, such as for presentations by victims and for the delivery of the judgment. Hearings in Ruto's case are scheduled to resume on January 16.

<p>Ruto is facing trial for crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in inciting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">violence that followed the 2007 Kenyan election</a> [JURIST news archive] which led to more than 1,100 deaths. This makes Ruto the first senior serving politician to appear in an international court. Also facing trial is Kenyan <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [ICC materials]. Ruto <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-deputy-president-pleads-not-guilty-at-icc-trial.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges against him in September. Earlier that month, Kenya's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion</a> [JURIST report] to leave the ICC in response to Ruto's trial and the trial of President Uhuru Kenyatta, which was scheduled to begin in November.

Pillay stated that, for example, Rwanda and Uganda are hosts to members of the rebel group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">news archive</a>] from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), despite evidence of continued human rights abuses by the M23, including rape, executions and forced recruitment of young boys. Additionally, individuals suspected of participating in the <a href="http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/genocide_in_rwanda.htm">1994 Rwanda genocide</a> [UN backgrounder] remain in the DRC, in an attempt to escape prosecution and punishment. Pillay called for government leaders in the region to "stop turning a blind eye to the presence of people on their territory who are suspected of committing very serious crimes," and to ensure that there is a measure of accountability for those who have committed international crimes. Pillay further reported that the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/TruthJusticeReparation/Pages/Index.aspx">Special Rapporteur on transitional justice</a> [official profile] has requested invitations for country visits to a number of countries, including the DRC and Rwanda, and stated that "[e]xtending an invitation to the Special Rapporteur would be one step towards living up to the commitment to fight impunity."

<p>Ongoing human rights abuses and conflict in Africa's Great Lakes Region, especially in countries such as the DRC, have continued to bring international focus to the region. The top official for the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/monusco/">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (MONUSCO) [official website], Martin Kobler, in October <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-drc-mission-head-condemns-attacks-by-armed-rebel-group.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a series of attacks perpetrated by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/mayi-mayi.htm">Mayi-Mayi Cheka</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], which resulted in the deaths of 34 civilians, including 20 children, in the eastern region of the DRC. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/drc-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the establishment of a national human rights commission in the DRC, but said that rights abuses continue in the east. Also in September a top UN official <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-expert-calls-for-international-community-to-address-impunity-in-drc.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] the need to address the issue of impunity for those involved in human rights violations over the past year. In August UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia Pansieri said that <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-calls-for-drc-to-respect-human-rights.php">respecting human rights</a> [JURIST report] is essential to achieve stabilization in the DRC. In May the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that DRC troops committed numerous war crimes, including rape and murder, as they retreated from an advance by the M23 rebels in November of 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1168_8nk0.pdf">McCullen v. Coakley</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST report], the court is considering a Massachusetts law that establishes "buffer zones" for abortion clinics. The <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ma/buffer-zone-law-info-for-patients-18525.htm">buffer zone</a> [Planned Parenthood backgrounder] creates a protected area outside of the abortion clinic where people are not allowed to protest. The law creates a 35-foot buffer zone on the driveways and entrances to the facilities. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-massachusetts-abortion-clinic-buffer-zone.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] in January. The questions before the court are (1) whether the First Circuit erred in upholding Massachusetts' selective exclusion law under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, on its face and as applied to petitioners; and (2) if <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13410055345323866526&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Hill v. Colorado</a> [opinion] permits enforcement of this law, whether Hill should be limited or overruled. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1371_2cp3.pdf">US v. Castleman</a> [transcript, PDF] the court is considering whether a conviction for misdemeanor domestic assault qualifies as a conviction for a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(9)</a> [text], which makes it a federal crime for people convicted in state courts of "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" involving the use or attempted use of physical force to later possess a firearms. Castleman was indicted on two counts of firearm  possession, but the <a href="http://www.tnwd.uscourts.gov/">United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee</a> [official web site] dismissed both counts, ruling that his misdemeanor was not for a domestic violence crime requiring "the use or attempted use of physical force," which the court felt required violent contact. The US then appealed to the US <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Castleman_695_F3d_582_6th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">affirmed</a> [text] the district court's ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/05.02.13_halbig_v._sebelius_complaint.pdf">argued</a> [complaint, PDF] that the PPACA allowed subsidies in the form of tax credits for people who obtain insurance only in exchanges established by states but not for people in healthcare exchanges created by the federal government. The subsidies are available to people and families who have an annual income level below 400 percent of the current federal poverty level. Judge Paul Friedman noted that "[t]here is evidence throughout the statute of Congress's desire to ensure broad access to affordable health coverage," which meant that Congress clearly intended for the subsidies to be available nationwide regardless of whether the exchange was set up by the state or federal government. A lawyer for the parties who brought the suit has already <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/15/usa-court-obamacare-idUSL2N0KP17Q20140115">filed a notice of appeal</a> [Reuters report] for the ruling.

<p>This challenge is one of the <a href="/hotline/2012/04/sekulow-white-health-care.php">latest developments</a> and one of several <a href="/forum/2010/04/is-health-care-reform-constitutional.php">criticisms</a> [JURIST op-eds] concerning the PPACA. Last Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts of the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-justice-refuses-to-block-health-care-law.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to grant a temporary injunction blocking the Obama administration from enforcing the PPACA, denying physician groups' plea arguing the entire law is unconstitutional due to the method of its passing. Earlier this month, US Senator <a href="http://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/public/">Ron Johnson</a> (R-WI) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-senator-files-lawsuit-over-health-care-provision.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against the US <a href="http://www.opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM) [official website] in the US <a href="http://www.wied.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] attempting to block the federal government from paying a portion of the PPACA health care coverage for members of Congress and their staffs. Also this month, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-government-asks-supreme-court-to-lift-stay-on-contraception-mandate.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] asking the US Supreme Court [official website] to remove the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-justice-blocks-contraception-mandate-in-lawsuit.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] on the contraception mandate in the PPACA that was put in place by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Last December the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-challenge-to-health-care-employer-mandate.php">refused to hear</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/liberty-university-v-lew/">challenge</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] by <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [official website] to the PPACA mandate requiring employers to provide affordable health insurance for their employees. In June the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Treasury</a> (DOT) [official website] announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/treasury-department-delays-ppaca-employer-mandate.php">delay enforcing</a> [JURIST report] the PPACA employer mandate for businesses with 50 or more full-time employees until 2015. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, new constitution <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/91686/Egypt/Politics-/-of-votes-in--governorates-in-favour-of-draft-cons.aspx">garnered</a> [Ahram Online report] 97.57 percent  "yes" votes and 1.48 percent "no" votes with results in from 26 of Egypt's 27 provinces. According to Al-Ahram, turnout for the election was 42.2 percent. Election monitors <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-said-to-approve-new-constitution/2014/01/16/a7ae8eb6-7ebf-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html">have reported</a> [<em>WP</em> report] serious violations and irregularities in voting. A preliminary <a href="http://www.transparency.org/files/content/pressrelease/Preliminary_Statement_Egypt.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] issued by the global anti-corruption organization <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> (TI) [advocacy website] has accused the government of restricting parties campaigning against the constitution and found "politically motivated violence, intimidation and repression from state and non-state actors limited and conditioned citizens' political and electoral participation." The two days of polling have <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/egypt-constitutional-vote-death-violence-morsi-cairo">seen</a> [<em>UK Guardian</em> report] widespread violence throughout the country, including bomb attacks in Cairo and clashes between pro-government and pro-Morsi supporters.Approval of the new constitution has been viewed as a possible springboard for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/rare-interview-with-egyptian-gen-abdel-fatah-al-sissi/2013/08/03/a77eb37c-fbc4-11e2-a369-d1954abcb7e3_story.html">Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sissi</a> [<em>WP</em> backgrounder], Egypt's armed forces chief and defense minister to run for president. 

<p>Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. In December the Egyptian Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-assembly-finalizes-draft-constitution-raises-election-concerns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the finalized draft of the new constitution. The secular-based document reflects a shift in policy from the strongly Islamist-leaning document approved under former President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>]. In November the referendum on the constitution originally scheduled for December,<a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-to-delay-constitutional-referendum-by-one-month.php"> was postponed</a> [JURIST report] until January to allow the Assembly more time to complete amendments to the document. The previous constitution has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">in suspension</a> [JURIST report] since Morsi's removal in July. That document <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-opposition-to-appeal-constitutional-referendum.php">was approved</a> [JURIST report] by referendum in December 2012, although its opponents appealed its adoption, alleging that its approval was obtained through widespread fraud and irregularities in the administration of the voting. Despite the opposition's allegations, Morsi signed the former constitution into law only three days later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/icc/imb">The International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB), a specialized division of the <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/News/Articles/2014/Somali-pirate-clampdown-caused-drop-in-global-piracy,-IMB-report-reveals/">reported</a> [press release] on Wednesday that maritime pirate attacks have reached their lowest levels in six years, dropping 40 percent since 2011. Pottengal Mukundan, Director of the IMB, attributes the decrease in attacks to a clampdown on piracy in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14094503">Somalia</a> [BBC profile]. Somalia experienced 237 pirate attacks in 2011, but only 15 incidents in 2013. Mukundan says that Somali pirates have been deterred by the role of international navies, the hardening of vessels, the use of private armed guards and the stabilizing influence of Somali's central government. The 15 incidents in Somalia included two hijacked vessels that were returned within a day due to naval interference and eight vessels fired upon. While Somali piracy incidents made up a small portion of the total attacks in 2013, 15 of 264, the eight hijacking incidents represents the majority of the total of 12 hijacking incidents. 

<p>A number of countries around the world have taken actions in the attempt to solve the problem of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October three Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/accused-somali-pirates-on-trial-in-france-for-2009-hijacking.php">accused of hijacking</a> [JURIST report] a private yacht off the coast of Somalia in 2009 went on trial in France. In August a jury in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/somali-men-found-guilty-of-hijacking-a-boat-and-killing-four-americans-in-2011.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three Somali men of hijacking a boat and killing four Americans in 2011 off the coast of Somalia. In February the Abu Dhabi Federal Appeal Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uae-court-upholds-sentences-for-somali-pirates.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of ten Somali pirates convicted of highjacking a UAE-owned bulk-carrier ship in April 2011. In October 2012 the <a href="http://justiz.hamburg.de/oberlandesgericht/">Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">issued sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 10 Somalis who were involved in the hijacking the German freighter MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia two years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The company is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-to-be-tried-in-the-uk-high-court-upholds-british-claimants-secret-tracking-case-9064826.html">being sued for breach of privacy</a> [<em>UK Independent</em> report] by over 100 users of Apple's Safari browser who claim that Google tracked their browsing history without their knowledge, breaching the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">1998 Data Protection Act</a> [text]. The company's lawyers argued that the case should be heard in California, where Google is based, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/10576284/High-Court-Google-privacy-case-can-be-heard-in-UK.html">claiming </a>[<em>UK Telegraph</em> report] that assigning jurisdiction to the UK courts was inappropriate. The High Court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/uk-court-rejects-google-bid-stop-privacy-suit-21553956">rejected Google's bid </a>[AP report] to stop the suit. Google has said that it plans to seek appeal, stating that it won a very similar case in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-09/google-wins-dismissal-of-suit-over-cookies-on-internet-browsers.html">Delaware </a>[Bloomberg report] earlier this year when the plaintiff could not prove that he suffered a loss of property or money. The case of the British claimants differs from the Delaware case, however, as it is strengthened by the UK's Data Protection Act. This lawsuit has the potential to set a precedent for the ability of UK customers to litigate against US based internet companies.

<p>Google has faced many legal challenges regarding the privacy of internet users. Last year the French data protection agency Commission nationale de l'nformatique et des libertes (CNIL) said that EU data protection agencies <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/eu-to-take-action-against-google-for-failing-to-follow-privacy-laws.php">intended to take action</a> against Google and investigate the Internet company's failure to comply with EU privacy laws. Also last year an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned a conviction of Google executives</a> [JURIST report] for privacy violations from allowing a bullying video to be posted on its site. In 2012 the company was<a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php"> fined $22.5 million</a> [JURIST report] for alleged privacy misrepresentations concerning Apple's Safari Internet browser.  Earlier that year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed </a>[JURIST report] a suit filed by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, that asked the <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to block <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's proposed privacy changes</a> [text] that would allow a user's information to be shared among several Google products, including YouTube, Gmail and Google Maps. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Daniel Bekele, Africa director at HRW, said, "Appalling crimes have been committed against civilians for no other reason than their ethnicity," and that both sides need to accept a credible, independent investigation into these crimes. UN estimates that 400,000 people are displaced in South Sudan, which they attribute to targeted killings of civilians, destruction of civilian property and looting by both parties to the conflict. HRW has urged both the government and opposition forces to end these abuses to civilians. HRW also called on the UN to issue an asset freeze and travel ban on any person credibly identifiable as responsible for these serious human rights abuses and violations of international human rights law. HRW's report came after their research team interviewed more than 200 victims and witnesses in Juba and Bor, where HRW found a large amount of the targeted killings to take place.

<p>The conflict in the world's youngest nation has been characterized by ethnic and sectarian violence. UN officials said last month that they have found <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/24/south-sudan-mass-graves-discovered-un">three mass grave sites</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and believe that the death toll of the conflict may already be in the thousands. The US government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/US-military-personnel-deploy-to-assist-in-south-sudan-evacuation.php">deployed 150 military personnel</a> [JURIST report] in December in preparation for possible evacuation of US citizens from South Sudan. More than 300 US citizens had already been evacuated as of the deployment. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmiss/">UN Mission in South Sudan</a> (UNMISS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unmiss-partially-evacuates-staff-from-south-sudan.php">began evacuating</a> [JURIST report] all non-critical staff from Juba earlier last month after a UNMISS base was assaulted, killing 20 ethnic Dinka civilians and two UN peacekeepers. In April, prior to the current conflict, UNMISS <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/south-sudan-must-do-more-to-protect-civilians-from-violence-un.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] urging the South Sudan government to do more to protect civilians from violence.

Speaking to attendees at UN Headquarters in New York, Deputy Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/advocates/members/jan-eliasson.shtml">Jan Eliasson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46936&Cr=genocide&Cr1=#.UtgbfbTMYdw">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] the importance of remembering the collective failure to prevent the Rwanda genocide, calling the phrase "never again" a sign of continued failure in itself. He went on to <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/dsg/statements/index.asp?nid=481">cite</a> [text] Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-moon's</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/rightsupfront/">"Rights up Front" Action Plan</a> [UN backgrounder], which seeks to strengthen the UN's ability to prevent large scale violations of human rights. The concepts guiding the plan include the idea of prevention as a common responsibility of the entire UN system, the need for the UN system to operate as one, the importance of early action and the crucial nature of sharing information with member states and national actors about human rights violations. In his statement, Eliasson called the need to address current human rights violations in the Central African Republic and South Sudan particularly urgent. 

<p>Many countries have attempted to assist the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in locating and bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. In November a French appeals court in Paris<a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php"> approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Claude Muhayimana and Innocent Musabyimana, two suspects wanted in connection with the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In April<a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php"> French law enforcement officials arrested</a> [JURIST report] Tite Barahira, a former Rwandan leader, for conspiracy to commit genocide. In January Rwandan genocide suspect Innocent Musabyimana was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested </a>[JURIST report] in France on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In December the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison and concluding the tribunal's final trial. Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. In July 2012 the ICTR Residual Mechanism <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42402&Cr=Criminal&Cr1=Tribunal#.UbixLI6nVgI">began its work</a> [UN News Centre report] assisting with the winding down of the ICTR and assuring that all remaining fugitives of the Rwandan genocide face justice. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During questioning in Geneva, committee member Sara Oviedo <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20140116-vatican-harsh-criticism-un-hearing-geneva-child-sex-abuse/">forced Vatican officials to acknowledge</a> [AFP report] that the Holy See had been slow to react to allegations of sexual abuse by clergy members. During hours of questioning, members of the committee pressed the Vatican over what kind of sanctions are imposed on abusive priests, whether bishops cover up priests by transferring them to other parishes, and transparency. Vatican former sex crimes prosecutor Monsignor Charles Scicluna, while admitting some Vatican fault, assured the committee it was committed to to take action against anyone who obstructs justice. Legal groups, such as the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/world/europe/un-vatican-sexual-abuse/?hpt=wo_c1">called Thursday's hearing</a> [CNN report] "a milestone in calling for an end to these days of impunity."

<p>The CCR <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/iccvaticanprosecution">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2011 against Vatican officials for systematic sexual abuse and the concealment of such incidents. The complaint was filed on behalf of the <a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org/">Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests</a> (SNAP) [advocacy website] and included more than 20,000 pages of materials relating to the crimes. The claim was seen as likely to focus international attention on the issue of sexual abuse of children around the world, even if the complaint does not reach the ICC's jurisdictional standards. In 2010 the Vatican <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">released</a> [JURIST report] church procedures for handling alleged cases of sexual abuse by priests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay claimed that she has received numerous reports from reliable eyewitness sources claiming that several civilians in the custody of armed opposition forces have already been executed this year. She reminded all parties involved that such executions are clearly prohibited by <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/375-590006">Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions</a> [text], which states that those taking no part in hostilities are to be treated humanely.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to threaten the lives of millions of citizens in the country and refugees have emigrated to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq in alarming numbers since 2011.

Earlier in December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported growing evidence of <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-rights-chief-syria-government-likely-committing-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Syria.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmaldives.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen refused Thursday to ratify a law that would partially criminalize marital rape, calling it "un-Islamic." The law was <a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/president-yameen-vetoes-sexual-offences-bill-75176">passed</a> [Minivan News report] by the Maldivian Parliament 67-2 last month. While the law would not have criminalized all cases of marital rape, it would have outlaw it in cases when a dissolution action is pending, when a divorce action has been filed by the husband, if the intent of the intercourse is to transmit a sexually transmitted disease, or if the couple agrees to a mutual separation. Yameen claims the bill is contrary to Islamic law and Islamic principles. Vice president of the Maldives Fiqh Academy, Mohamed Iyaz Abdul Latheef <a href="http://minivannews.com/society/fiqh-academy-vp-condemns-sexual-offenses-bill-for-conditional-criminalisation-of-marital-rape-74565">condemned</a> [Minivan News report] the bill saying that, according to Islamic law, the wife does not have the authority to refuse sex. 

<p>The Maldives has created significant controversy through the most recent presidential election and the judiciary's involvement. In November, the high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/maldives-high-court-delays-presidential-election-for-third-time.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] the presidential election for the third time. In October UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-chief-accuses-maldives-court-of-interfering-in-election.php">asserted</a> [JURIST report] that the Supreme Court of the Maldives has meddled excessively in the nation's presidential elections. In February the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-maldives-judges-lawyer-facing-outside-pressure.php">found that lawyers and judges in the Maldives are not adequately independent</a> [JURIST report] from outside influence and called for a separation of powers between the parliament and court system.

The ruling, made last month by Judge Timothy Black, found that by treating lawful same-sex marriages differently than it treats lawful opposite sex marriages, Ohio law violates the US Constitution <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Although citizens of Ohio voted in 2004 to make same-sex marriage illegal within the state, Black argued that the right to remain married is properly recognized as one that is a fundamental liberty interest appropriately protected by the due process clause of the US Constitution. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an intensely debated issue in the US. A judge for the <a href="http://www.oknd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday that Oklahoma's ban on same-sex marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Last week US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed in the state of Utah. A judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's same-sex marriage ban in December, and the state began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples the day the ruling was issued. Earlier this month the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in Utah was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocked</a> by the US Supreme Court after the <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/">Utah Attorney General</a> [official website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">application for stay</a> [JURIST reports] with the court. Also in January four same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/arizona-couples-file-lawsuit-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] seeking to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.

The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/17/us-madagascar-election-idUSBREA0G0I120140117">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that Rajaonarimampianina won 53.5 percent of the vote while his opponent Jean Louis Robinson, former health minister, won 46.5 percent. Controversy has surrounded the election and continues to be disputed. Observers of the election <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24694421">claim it was run fairly</a> [BBC report]. However, the Robinson campaign has challenged the results since they were first announced. Robinson was supported by former president Marc Ravalomanana who was ousted in a coup in 2009. Only about half of Madagascar citizens voted in the run-off election. Tourism has reportedly dropped 50 percent since the election controversy began.

<p>Madagascar's elections followed a tumultuous period for the country. In August, the same electoral court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/madagascar-elections-court-removes-candidates-from-ballot.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] several candidates from the ballot.

The prolonged execution of convicted murderer Dennis McGuire on Thursday has stirred a controversy over new drugs used to administer lethal injections. McGuire was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/ohio-killer-executed-with-new-lethal-drug-combo/4512651/">convicted</a> [AP report] in 1994 of raping and murdering a 22-year-old girl in 1989 and lost his <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/1997/1997-ohio-335.pdf">appeal</a> [text, PDF] to the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1997. Earlier this month McGuire's attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-new-execution-method-causes-suffering-death-row-inmate.php">filed for a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website], claiming that the untried execution method would cause McGuire to experience a suffocation-like syndrome known as air hunger. On Monday a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-allows-untried-drug-in-ohio-lethal-injection.php">refused to halt the execution</a>, even though the drug had never been used before and had the potential to inflict pain on McGuire.The judge found that the evidence failed to prove a substantial risk of severe pain, and therefore the new injection would not constitute a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Several states that employ capital punishment have been seeking alternative lethal injection compounds because the European Union (EU) <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/germany-urges-eu-export-ban-on-execution-drug.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] German and Danish drugmakers from selling sodium thiopental, a commonly used lethal injection compound, to US prisons in 2011. In July the the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/2E33B7631B436F6385257BB1005178CC/$file/12-5176-1448004.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] policy that allowed the importation of thiopental was<a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fda-cannot-allow-import-of-execution-drug.php"> illegal</a> [JURIST report].  

<p>The shortage of sodium thiopental in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol. In August a state judge in Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arkansas-judge-rules-part-of-execution-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law provision allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections violates the constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. In 2011 two Texas inmates requested <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">stays on their executions</a> [USA Today report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/us/02lethal.html?_r=1&">Kentucky and Tennessee surrendered supplies of sodium thiopental</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) after the agency seized Georgia's supply in order to investigate whether the drug was properly imported.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ugandan <a href="http://presidentmuseveni.com/">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4124584.stm">profile</a>] refused to sign a <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ug/new/index.php/about-parliament/parliamentary-news/326-parliament-outlaws-homosexuality">bill</a> [press release] proposed by the nation's <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ug/new/index.php">Parliament</a> [official website] that would toughen punishments for homosexuals in Uganda. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/21/world/africa/uganda-anti-gay-bill/">introduced</a> [CNN report] in 2009 and the Ugandan Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] last month. Homosexuality has long been illegal in Uganda, and the bill was introduced to inflict harsher penalties for the crime. The bill would <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25775002">impose life sentences</a> [BBC report] for "aggravated homosexuality" and criminalize not reporting gay people. Museveni wrote a letter to the parliamentary speaker, criticized her for passing the bill without a quorum. In the letter, Museveni said that he believes homosexuals are sick and abnormal, but that they can be "rescued". Museveni is attempting to reach a compromise with members of parliament, because they have the ability to pass the bill without his signature through a two-thirds vote. 

<p>The bill's history has garnered international attention, and many see it as a reaction to major legislative reforms in support of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US and other Western nations. Last November the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/controversional-uganda-anti-gay-bill-to-pass-by-end-of-2012-ap-report.php">bolstered</a> [JURIST report] by religious leaders in Uganda.

In 2010 US President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined the US Congress in <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">denouncing the bill</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25463942">Roughly two-thirds</a> [BBC report, map] of African nations criminalize homosexuality, according to an Amnesty International report published earlier this year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday that Part A of the amendment <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/appeal-filed-in-oklahoma-same-sex-marriage-ruling/article_c331b796-7f26-11e3-aeac-0019bb30f31a.html">violates</a> [<em>Tulsa World</em> report] the Equal Protections Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In his opinion, Judge Terence Kern <a href="http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/Bishop_vs_Oklahoma_Opinion_01142014.pdf">wrote</a> [text, PDF] that Part A was an, "arbitrary and irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a governmental benefit."

The original lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/oklahoma-couples-file-gay-marriage-ban.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] the ban was filed by two lesbian couples in 2004. 

<p>Challenges to state laws and constitutional amendments has become increasingly common in recent years, and it has been a successful avenue for many to affect change in their state's marriage laws.

In October two Oregon couples <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/oregon-couples-challenge-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> a federal lawsuit challenging their state's ban, following a similar <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/national-gay-rights-organization-files-lawsuit-against-west-viriginias-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filing</a> [JURIST reports] by an advocacy group in West Virginia on behalf of three same-sex couples there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his opinion, MicGinley wrote that the state had <a href="http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140117/updated-judge-strikes-down-photo-id-requirement-for-pa-voters">failed to adequately explain</a> [AP report] why the law was a necessary measure: "Voting laws are designed to assure a free and fair election; the Voter ID Law does not further this goal." The law was determined to place an unreasonable burden on the fundamental right to vote. Enforcement of the law has been blocked pending final resolution of the case in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Critics of the law have denounced it as a cynical tool of voter suppression, while its supporters claim that such laws are necessary to safeguard against voter fraud though it has been acknowledged that there are no known cases of voter impersonation within the state. Those challenging the law demonstrated at trial the difficult administrative process necessary to obtain a voter ID card and the problems in processing and distributing them, leading to a failure of many potential voters to receive their ID cards prior to elections. 

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/voter-id-laws.php">Voter identification laws</a> [JURIST Feature] are a major source of controversy and critics on both sides of the issue accuse one another of trying to manipulate voting populations to their advantage. The laws and challenges to them are not uncommon, in 2012 the Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-passes-voter-identification-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] its version of a voter ID law, and in 2009 an Indiana state court <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/indiana-appeals-court-declares-state.php">found</a> [JURIST report] its state's voter ID law unconstitutional. This is also not the first time Pennsylvania's law has been through its court system. In September 2012 the state Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a decision of the lower court upholding the law, and remanded the matter for further consideration. Later, in October of that year the Commonwealth Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against enforcement of the law in anticipation of the then-upcoming presidential election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Referring to the agreement as <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303465004579324880766804684?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303465004579324880766804684.html">financially imprudent</a> [WSJ report], Judge Steven Rhodes put a halt to what has been the only completed deal in efforts to cut down the city's $18 billion long-term debt obligation. However, the court did approve of the city borrowing <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/detroit-bankruptcy-swaps-deal/4522443/">$120 million</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report] for blight removal as well as improvements to city services. Currently, the city pays UBS and Bank of America $50 million each year, 5 percent of Detroit's annual budget, to reduce its debt. 

<p>Detroit's bankruptcy matter has been working its way through the court system since the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July of last year. In December 2013 Rhodes ordered the city to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-deal-too-generous-towards-banks.php">renegotiate</a> its bankruptcy-related financing with UBS and Bank of America, serving as the impetus for this week's proposed settlement between the parties. Earlier in December Rhodes ruled that Detroit is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-court-rules-detroit-eligible-for-bankruptcy.php">eligible and authorized to file for bankruptcy</a> [JURIST report], declaring the city insolvent because it owes approximately $18 billion to more than 100,000 creditors, which is harming the city's residents and making it essentially impossible for the city to negotiate with creditors. In July Rhodes <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-clears-way-for-detroit-bankruptcy-case.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] Detroit's bankruptcy filing to continue, declaring that his federal bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. This action placed a stay on a Michigan circuit court ruling that had been announced three days earlier, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/michigan-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional.php">declared the filing unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because it threatened public pension benefits and those benefits are protected by the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/constitution.pdf">Michigan Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Earlier this fall JURIST guest columnists Patrick Brady and Igor Shleypak discussed how Detroit's pension plan holders have been <a href="/dateline/2013/09/patrick-brady-detroit-bankruptcy.php">fighting for their rights</a> in this case and explored the <a href="/dateline/2013/08/igor-shleypak-detroit-bankruptcy.php">broader consequences</a> [JURIST op-eds] that Detroit's actions may have on other cities that consider filing for protection under Chapter 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reform to the program entails a handful of initiatives outlined by Obama, focusing on additional oversight, transparency, and restrictions on government's ability to use the collected data, such as the use of incidentally collected information in criminal trials. Obama touched on the infamous and highly-controversial mass collection practices, stating, "I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk metadata."

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/gathering-phone-records-unlawful.php">appeal</a> to a federal district court ruling that held that the NSA program is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">likely unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. In September the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a previously classified <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/791759/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] explaining why a NSA program to keep records of Americans' phone calls is constitutional. Also in September the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers. In August the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the <a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php">NSA surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged, <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">raise significant First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011714zr_aplc.pdf">granted review</a> [text, PDF] over the issue of police authority to search the contents of an arrested individual's cell phone. The court accepted two cases on the matter to review. The first, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/riley-v-california/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Riley v. California</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], is a state court case that involves a challenge to searching an arrested individual without a warrant. After being arrested, police examined Riley's cell phone, which was described as more of a hand-held computer. In granting <em>certiorari</em>, the court amended the question presented to: "Whether evidence admitted at petitioner's trial was obtained in a search of petitioner's cell phone that violated petitioner's Fourth Amendment rights." In the federal case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-wurie/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">United States v. Wurie</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will examine a similar fact pattern, but the cell phone was an ordinary flip-phone. After arresting Wurie on suspicion of dealing drugs, police inspected his cell phone and retrieved phone numbers that were repeatedly calling his phone. Police traced the calls back to Wurie's home where they found drugs and guns. Even though these cases address the same constitutional issue, the court chose not to consolidate the cases. The court also agreed Friday to rule in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-483.htm">Lane v. Franks</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lane-Petition-and-Appendix.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine (1) whether the government is categorically free under the First Amendment to retaliate against a public employee for truthful sworn testimony that was compelled by subpoena and was not a part of the employee's ordinary job responsibilities; and (2) whether qualified immunity precludes a claim for damages in such an action.

<p>Cell phones have caused significant legal controversy. In July, the  <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/fifth-circuit-rules-warrant-not-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that warrants were not required to track cell phones. The week before, the New Jersey Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-jersey-supreme-court-rules-warrants-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that police must obtain search warrants before obtaining tracking information from cell phone providers, marking the first time a state supreme court has recognized a Fourth Amendment protection for cell phone location data. In May the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2013/sc11-1130.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that police <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/florida-top-court-rules-warrantless-cell-phone-searches-unconstitutional.php">need a warrant</a> [JURIST report] to search a defendant's cell phone at the time of arrest. Last December, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-data-stored-on-cell-phones-not-protected.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that data stored on personal cell phones is not protected by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701">Stored Communications Act</a> (SCA) [text]. The Senate Judiciary Committee that November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/Senate-committee-approves-bill-requiring-warrant-to-search-emails.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent police from searching e-mails and other electronic content without a warrant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"The spike in the number of executions carried out so far this month in Iran is alarming," said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. "The Iranian authorities must urgently take steps to abolish the death penalty, which has been shown again and again not to have any special deterrent effect on crime." According to the report, the Iranian government has only official acknowledged 21 of the executions with the other 19 being reported to Amnesty International through "reliable sources". Most of the executions were for drug-related offenses. The rights group, which unilaterally opposes the death penalty, has called on Iran to reform its policy on capital punishment.

<p>Iran's harsh death penalty policy and treatment of prisoners has been questioned by human rights groups. In January 2013, UN human rights experts called for Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">halt the executions</a> [JURIST report] of five Ahwazi activists condemned on charges of "enmity against God, corruption on earth and causing propaganda against the government". The UN General Assembly in November 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-committee-expresses-concern-for-human-rights-in-iran.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over human rights violations in Iran that include hanging as a method of execution, public executions, and executions of minors. In October 2012 Iran <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/10-executed-in-iran-despite-pleas-by-human-rights-groups-ai.php">executed ten members of drug smuggling gangs</a> [JURIST report] despite pleas by the UN and Amnesty International to stay executions for non-violent crimes. Iran has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">accused of "execution binging"</a> [JURIST report] as far back as January 2011 when the <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [advocacy website] claimed they were "executing one prisoner every eight hours".</p>]]></content:encoded>

The impasse arose from still contested elections held in July 2013 and has had "a direct impact on the enjoyment of human rights by all in Cambodia." Subedi released his statement following a three-hour meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen and other senior government officials. "Flexibility on both sides to reach a political compromise is needed," said Subedi. "The Prime Minister has sent an important signal to the international community that he is ready and willing to seriously address the human rights issues in the country by extending full cooperation during this visit and engaging in meaningful dialogue."

<p>The Cambodian government has been criticized for its response to protests in the capitol Phnom Penh.

The protests began January 3 when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25593553">police opened fire</a> [BBC report] on striking textile workers in Phnom Penh. Political tension has been high since the <a href="http://www.nationalrescueparty.org/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> [official website], Cambodia's opposition party, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/cambodia-political-party-alleges-irregularities-in-election-results.php">disputed the results</a> [JURIST report] of the country's July 2013 elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court based its decision on an interpretation of Section 7 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF], which creates a broad definition of "unlawful enemy combatant" and limits the availability of judicial review for non-citizens who fit this definition and are held in US custody. The court of appeals affirmed the district court ruling on Friday, stating that Congress has constitutional authority to withhold jurisdiction pursuant to the MCA, and the legislature expressly prohibited lawsuits of this type when the statue was enacted. Al Janko, a native of Syria, was imprisoned by Taliban forces in Afghanistan in 2000. Following the terrorist attacks on the US on September 11, the Afghan government liberated the prison but US forces identified Al Janko as an "enemy combatant" and transferred him to Guantanamo in May 2002. A district court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-rules-guantanamo-detainee.php">granted his release</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after the prisoner filed a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. Al Janko brought a suit for damages in the US District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2011 for alleged torturous acts during a seven-and-a-half year stay in the prison, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The treatment of prisoners at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST feature] has raised humanitarian concerns internationally and in recent months the US has <a href="/forum/2013/11/jeffrey-addicott-ghailani-combatant.php">grappled</a> [JURIST op-ed] with the complexities of the laws of war and the legal rights of due process for detainees. Earlier in January the panel review board (PRB) administered by the US Department of Defense (DoD) under <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/executive-order-periodic-review-individuals-detained-guant-namo-bay-nava">Executive Order 13567</a> [text] concluded its first review and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/guantanamo-panel-closes-first-review-ruling-detainee-to-be-released.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] a former Guantanamo detainee for transfer to Yemen. A week prior three Uighur Muslim detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/last-uighur-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">transferred</a> to Slovakia and in December of last year two Guantanamo detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-transfers-2-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudi-arabia.php">transferred</a> to Saudi Arabia [JURIST reports]. Also last December, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/dc-circuit-affirms-habeas-denial-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a denial of a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> for a Guantanamo detainee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was brought by several North Carolina physicians and health care providers on behalf of themselves and their patients as a challenge to the constitutionality of a state law passed in 2011. The <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?BillID=H854&Session=2011">Woman's Right to Know Act</a> [materials] required women to have an ultrasound administered and explained by a medical professional at least four hours before she would be permitted to undergo an abortion. Also, the law mandated that images of the ultrasound be displayed so the woman could view them and a medical professional must offer the woman the opportunity to hear the fetal heart tone. From the outset, the law was controversial in North Carolina, as former governor Beverly Perdue <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> the legislation but was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">overruled</a> [JURIST reports] by the state legislature. Once the law took effect, an <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] was issued by US District Judge Catherine Eagles in 2011, and it was she who ultimately declared the law unconstitutional in Friday's ruling. Several rights groups such as Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Reproductive Rights strongly denounced the legislation and claimed Friday's ruling as a <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/index.php/blog/victory-federal-court-strikes-down-demeaning-north-carolina-ultrasound-law.html">victory</a> [ACLU press release] for the rights of physicians and women.

<p>The ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US has impacted state legislatures, federal courts, and the US Supreme Court in recent weeks. On Thursday the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccullen-v-coakley/">McCullen v. Coakley</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] over a law creating abortion clinic "buffer zones," establishing a 35-foot protective area that surrounds an abortion clinic where individuals are not permitted to protest. Also last week the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined to rule</a> on an Arizona abortion law banning the procedure after the fetus reaches 20 weeks old, which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">overturned</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in May of 2013 [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/fifth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">heard arguments </a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of an abortion law passed in Texas last July, which could result in the closing of many of the state's abortion clinics. Regarding the specific issue of ultrasounds before abortions, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-oklahoma-abortion-ultrasound-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear a case surrounding Oklahoma's version of the law two months ago, which was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It was the first Egyptian vote after the overthrow of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] last July. According to Egypt's Supreme Electoral Commission, 38.6 percent of eligible voters <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2014/01/18/new-constitution-passes-in-landslide/">took part</a> [Daily News Egypt report] in the referendum. The new constitution strengthens the military, the police and the judiciary, provides more rights to women and disabled citizens and removes Islamist-leaning clauses inserted under Morsi. A spokesman for Egypt's interim presidency Ehab Badawi said that "this vote represents a resounding rejecting of terrorism and a clear endorsement of the roadmap to democracy, as well as economic development and stability." However, the votes integrity has been <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-egyptian-constitution-approved-according-to-unofficial-results.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by opposition members and rights campaigners, who say people were threatened not to vote no. Up to 35 people who were campaigning against the constitution were arrested. 

<p>Egypt has faced political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began over two years ago. In December the Egyptian Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-assembly-finalizes-draft-constitution-raises-election-concerns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the finalized draft of the new constitution. The secular-based document reflects a shift in policy from the strongly Islamist-leaning document approved under former President Mohamed Morsi. In November the referendum on the constitution originally scheduled for December, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-to-delay-constitutional-referendum-by-one-month.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] until January to allow the Assembly more time to complete amendments to the document. The previous constitution has been in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">suspension</a> [JURIST report] since Morsi's removal in July. That document <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-opposition-to-appeal-constitutional-referendum.php">was approved</a> [JURIST report] by referendum in December 2012, although its opponents appealed its adoption, alleging that its approval was obtained through widespread fraud and irregularities in the administration of the voting. Despite the opposition's allegations, Morsi signed the former constitution into law only three days later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] spokesperson Marixie Mercado, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_71780.html">recruitment of child soldiers</a> [press release] is happening on all sides of the conflict, which has taken on sectarian overtones. "Violence and insecurity make children more vulnerable to recruitment, particularly if they are separated from their families, displaced from their homes or have limited access to basic services and education. Sometimes their grief over the loss of parents or siblings is also exploited." UNICEF Representative in CAR Souleymane Diabate said. "In Bangui and around the country, UNICEF is working with all parties to the conflict to verify, release, and reunify children with their families. We are encouraged by this collaboration with the transitional authorities and continue to work with all parties for the release of all children without delay." 23 children were released from armed groups in Bangui on Thursday following negotiations between UN representatives and transitional authorities. Since May, UNICEF and partners have secured the release of 229 children associated with armed forces in the CAR.

<p>Last month UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that at least 16 children have been killed and 60 injured in the CAR since the outbreak of extreme violence in Bangui that began on December 5. Violence in 2013 resulted in the displacement of approximately 785,000 people in the country and over the past three weeks almost half of the population of Bangui was displaced to sites across the capital. Children have suffered throughout the conflict and earlier in December, UNICEF <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_71646.html">called for urgent action</a> [UNICEF report] to prevent child death and suffering due to malnutrition in the CAR. The UN is working to mitigate violence in the CAR and peacekeepers <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">were deployed</a> [JURIST report] following investigations from several UN rights agencies. During the initial stages of the conflict, UNICEF reported <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">the recruitment of child soldiers</a> [JURIST report] by both pro-government and rebel forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to threaten the lives of millions of citizens in the country and refugees have emigrated to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq in alarming numbers since 2011. Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-syria-executions-may-be-war-crimes.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian opposition groups that recent mass executions are in violation of international human rights, and that these acts may also constitute war crimes. Last month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-finds-more-evidence-of-chemical-weapons-used-in-syria.php">investigated the use of chemical weapons</a> [JURIST report] in Syria and found credible evidence that several more attacks occurred than previously reported. Also last month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-rights-chief-delivers-report-on-global-human-rights-progress.php">heightened its concern</a> [JURIST report] surrounding the country in a report on global rights progress, citing Syria and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CAR">Central African Republic</a> [JURIST news archive] as two major areas of instability. Earlier in December the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-rights-chief-syria-government-likely-committing-crimes-against-humanity.php">growing evidence of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Syria. In October the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-humanitarian-expert-urges-ceasefire-in-syria-for-evacuation-of-civilians.php">called for a cease fire</a> [JURIST report] in rural Damascus to allow humanitarian agencies to evacuate all remaining civilians and deliver medical aid to conflict areas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovich</a> [official website, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Viktor+Yanukovich">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed an anti-protest bill into law</a> [JURIST report] last week amid widespread protests. In its statement, the EU expressed concern that the anti-protest legislation violates essential freedom of expression rights: <blockquote>These legislative acts would significantly restrict the Ukrainian citizens' fundamental rights of association, media and the press, and seriously curtail the activities of civil society organisations. The EU calls on the Ukrainian authorities to ensure that these developments are reversed and that its legislation is brought in line with Ukraine's European and international commitments.</blockquote> The EU also called for an investigation into acts of violence that have <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/eu-urges-ukraine-to-scrap-new-laws-29931709.html">erupted in recent days</a> [AP report].

<p><a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">Protests began</a> [JURIST report] in late November after Yanukovich's decision to abandon a proposed trade pact with the EU.

EU foreign ministers agreed to send up to one thousand military personnel to the CAR, which would be the EU's first <a href="http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=79342">major military operation</a> [Reuters report] in six years. It remains unknown exactly which countries will provide troops to the operation, though Estonia has guaranteed that they will send troops, and Italy and Germany have stated that they will not.

The <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/egalite_femmes_hommes.asp">bill for equality between women and men</a> [text, in French] was prompted by statistics which showed that, among other things, French <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/20/french-mps-equality-law">women earn 25% less</a> [Guardian report] than their male co-workers and that only one of every seven of the 36,500 mayors in France are female. The new law would also <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/10585018/French-parliament-begins-debate-on-controversial-abortion-bill.html">eliminate the current requirement</a> [Telegraph report] that women prove they are in "distress" before they may legally terminate a pregnancy. Proponents of the law have stated that the "distress" requirement is obsolete, while opponents say that the new law will trivialize abortion. The <a href="http://www.senat.fr/lng/en/">French Senate</a> [official website] passed the gender equality law last September, and it will now be put to a vote by the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] after debates have concluded.

<p>The government of France has taken various measures in recent years, in a stated attempt to increase gender equality in the country. In October 2012, the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to reimburse women for all abortions and make contraceptives available for free to minors from age 15 to 18. In May of 2011, the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dc/av/default_EN.asp">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/council-of-europe-launches-international-treaty-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm">first international convention to combat violence against women</a> [text], to which France is a signatory. The treaty was formed in response to a statistic that at least 15 percent of women have been victims of domestic violence and targets crimes including rape, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment, forced abortion and forced sterilization. A burqa ban in France also officially <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-veil-ban-goes-into-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] on April 11, 2011 after the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill on July 13, 2010. Proponents of the ban have argued that it promotes a measure of gender equality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report is derived from almost 27,000 photographs which were obtained by a former military police officer in Syria who has since defected. The defector's role was to photograph the bodies of deceased individuals brought from detention facilities to a military hospital, which could reach up to 50 bodies a day. The report documents starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation, and other forms of systematic killings, and the majority of the victims are men aged between 20-40. The report stands by the defector's credibility, who was interviewed over three sessions in the previous 10 days. Monday's report arrived just 48 hours before the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24628442">Geneva II Conference on Syria</a> [BBC news report] is scheduled to commence in Switzerland on January 22nd, with intense political posturing surrounding the UN backed conference.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years, and there is mounting international pressure to find an end to the conflict. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [UN backgrounder] yesterday. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net">Syrian President Bashar, al-Assad</a> [official website] and the current regime. UN pressure on Syria has mounted in the last month as evidence revealed signs of war crimes in the country. Last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-syria-executions-may-be-war-crimes.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian opposition groups that eyewitness reports of mass executions are violations of human rights and may amount to war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three men, Amon Champyuni, Mathew Bello and Mussa Chiwisi were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i_F2Z23ek_MCKnCpmaRVk7GmVnoQ?docId=3f21140a-c86a-4dc2-8f4e-35cc3a484904">convicted</a> [AFP report] by a magistrate court in 2011 for the offenses of "unnatural acts" and "buggery" and were given sentences ranging from six to 12 years of hard labor. The hearings have been set for March 21. In Malawi, homosexual offenses by men are punishable by jail sentences up to 14 years, and similar offenses by women are subject to sentences up to five years. In addition to this challenge, the <a href="http://www.unaids.org/en/">UNAIDS</a> [official website] task force along with local human rights groups and the Malawi Law Society are also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/21/us-malawi-gays-idUSBREA0K0H420140121">challenging</a> [Reuters report] the constitutionality of the nation's anti-homosexual laws in a hearing scheduled for March 17. Such laws have reportedly caused strain in the relationship between the Malawi government and international donors, whose aid is heavily relied upon. 

<p>Anti-homosexual laws have become common in African nations, causing much internal and international contention between such countries, human rights groups, aid organizations and the international community. About 37 African nations currently <a href="http://www.globalequality.org/component/content/article/166">have</a> [CGE backgrounder] some form of law criminalizing homosexuality. Last week the president of Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill banning same-sex marriages and criminalizing homosexual associations, meetings and societies by subjecting them to punishment of up to fourteen years in prison. The new law caused a significant amount of international outcry, and was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigeria-anti-gay-law-draconian-un-rights-chief.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] to as "draconian" by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Malawi's relationship with anti-gay laws has been anything but constant. In November 2012 the nation <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-enacts-moratorium-on-anti-gay-laws.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium suspending the nation's anti-gay laws, only to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-changes-position-on-suspension-of-anti-gay-laws.php">reverse</a> [JURIST report] that position just three days later amid an outcry of protest from the Christian community. Malawi President Joyce Banda <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/malawi-president-vows-to-decriminalize-homosexuality.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] to decriminalize homosexuality in her first address to the nation in May 2012, a promise that has yet to be kept. The current legal challenge to Malawi's anti-gay laws is also not a novel one, in 2011 the Malawi Law Commission was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malawi-to-review-controversial-anti-homosexuality-law.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] to review several anti-gay laws, which ultimately proved unsuccessful. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decree gives the government broad powers in handling the unrest including censoring the media, establishing curfews, banning public gatherings and detaining suspects without the need for criminal charges. The decision was announced following a Cabinet meeting in response to the escalating violence as protesters blockaded sections of the capital and were met by armed police resistance.

<p>The protesters allege that the government is being run by former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> through his sister, current PM <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profiles] and are calling for her removal from office.

A statement from the Ministry website said the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25832282">executions</a> [BBC report] took place on Sunday. Human rights groups have long opposed the use of capital punishment in Iraq and the overarching legal system employed in the country, where reports of torture and forced confessions have surfaced. According to an annual <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/iraq">report</a> [2014 world report] on Iraq by the advocacy organization <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], Iraq executed at least 151 people in 2013, up from 129 in 2012, and 68 in 2011. According to the report, up to 48 criminal offenses are subject to the death penalty under Iraqi law. Iraqi officials defend capital punishment on the grounds it is sanctioned by Islam and it is an effective way to curb violence in the country. 

<p>Authorities in Iraq have led a significant crackdown on alleged domestic terrorists in recent months and the treatment of prisoners continues to bring concern from major international groups. In December Iraqi police <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/iraqi-police-arrest-sunni-mp-and-protest-supporter-on-terrorism-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a prominent supporter of anti-government protests and charged him with terrorism offenses. Earlier in December, UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-experts-call-on-iraqi-government-to-provide-whereabouts-of-7-camp-ashraf-residents.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iraq to provide information on the whereabouts of seven prisoners who were reportedly abducted following the massacre at Camp Ashraf in September. Last October Iraq officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/iraqi-officials-execute-42-people-convicted-on-terrorism-charges.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 42 people convicted of terrorism charges. Despite a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-iraq-execution-practices.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pallay</a> [UN backgrounder] last April, criminal executions in Iraq show no signs of stopping. JURIST Columnist Haider Ala Hamoudi of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law <a href="/forum/2013/12/haider-hamoudi-iraqi-constitutional.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that as Iraq's new government matures the country must address critical issues left ambiguous in the initial constitution and the execution style killings demand urgent attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In that trial, during which he stood accused of attempting to conceal the US citizenship of his mother in order to qualify for a presidential bid, Abu-Ismail reportedly <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/islamist-leader-sentenced-to-a-year-in-prison/article5601605.ece">stated</a> [AP report], "The court is void ... This is not a real judiciary in the first place." Abu-Ismail was a top ally and supporter of former Egyptian president Muhammed Morsi, and his supporters have seen his prosecution as part of the crackdown on Morsi supporters in the wake of the military coup that ousted him from power in 2013. 

<p>Conflict between pro-Morsi supporters and the Egyptian interim government has been relatively constant since the coup, with many of his most prominent supporters being charged with various crimes. However, Egyptians <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-egyptian-constitution-approved-according-to-unofficial-results.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution by referendum on January 16th, and it is yet unclear what if any impact this might have on the judicial proceedings underway against former Morsi supporters. Earlier this month, in three separate trials, Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-court-convicts-113-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-in-three-trials.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 113 members of the Muslim Brotherhood of various offenses stemming from November protests in Cairo. This is one of the largest mass trials to date in the nation. Just two days earlier, the Muslim Brotherhood, which originally supported Morsi and has subsequently been <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-court-upholds-ruling-to-ban-muslim-brotherhood.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] in Egypt, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ousted-egypt-ruling-party-files-complaint-with-icc-alleging-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a complaint with the International Criminal Court alleging crimes against humanity committed by the Egyptian military in its time in power since the July 2013 coup. The <a href="/dateline/2013/09/liesel-lecates-egypt-sentences.php">Egyptian judiciary</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been forced into the role of de-facto mediator between Egyptian factions during this political turmoil, prompting inquiry into the court system's fairness and legitimacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In response, West Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Earl Ray Tomblin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=264262322">proposed a bill</a> [AP report] that would require annual inspections of above-ground chemical storage tanks which are currently exempt from such oversight due to a loophole in the existing regulatory scheme. US Senator <a href="http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/">Joe Manchin</a> [official website] has called for similar legislation requiring regular inspection for any chemical facilities that could threaten a public water system.

<p>Chemical spills and water contamination have been highly publicized topics in environmental legislation. Earlier this month a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-multibillion-dollar-settlement-for-bp-oil-spill.php">upheld a multibillion dollar settlement</a> [JURIST report] for those facing financial loss from the 2010 <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST news archive]. <a href="http://www.xtoenergy.com/index.html">XTO Energy</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/">Exxon Mobil</a> [corporate websites], was <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/exxon-mobil-subsidiary-charged-for-wastewater-spill-in-pennsylvania.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in September 2013 for a 2010 spill of more than 50,000 gallons of contaminated wastewater in Pennsylvania with alleged violations carrying potential prison sentences. In June 2013 Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/illinois-governor-signs-strictest-fracking-law-in-nation.php">instituted the nation's most restrictive fracking legislation</a> [JURIST report], requiring drillers to apply for permits, provide frackwater samples, and to store used frackwater in above-ground tanks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-681_8mj8.pdf">Harris v. Quinn</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-adds-8-cases-to-docket.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on whether a state can "compel personal care providers to accept and financially support a private organization as their exclusive representative to petition the state for greater reimbursements from its Medicaid programs." The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Harris_v_Quinn_656_F3d_692_191_LRRM_2545_7th_Cir_2011_Court_Opini">held</a> [opinion] that "a collective bargaining agreement that requires Medicaid home-care personal assistants to pay a fee to a union representative [does not] violate the First Amendment." The court also ruled, "we lack jurisdiction to consider the claims of plaintiffs who have opted not to be in the union. Because they are not presently subject to mandatory fair share fees, their claims are not ripe." Counsel for Harris argued that charging personal care providers compulsory union fees "violates the First Amendment because the purpose of this mandatory association is inherently expressive." Counsel for respondent, however, argued that the fees will assist the state government in doing a more efficient job providing services to a "vulnerable population." Counsel for the US also argued on the respondent's behalf.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1315_09m1.pdf">Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-adds-8-cases-to-docket.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on "[w]hether the nonstatutory defense of <a href="http://www.nolo.com/dictionary/laches-term.html">laches</a> [Nolo definition] is available without restriction to bar all remedies for civil copyright claims filed within the three-year statute of limitations prescribed by Congress, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/507">17 USC &#167; 507(b)</a> [text]." There is a circuit split on the issue, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Petrella_v_MetroGoldwynMayer_Inc_695_F3d_946_104_USPQ2d_1144_9th_">adopted a presumption</a> [opinion] in favor of applying laches to continuing copyright infringements. Counsel for petitioner argued that the Supreme Court "has never applied laches to constrict a Federal statute of limitations, and rejected such a claim just four years ago." Counsel for the US also argued on the petitioner's behalf. Counsel for respondent, however, argued that the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions stated that, as in the case at hand, whenever there is "a rolling statute of limitations, laches is a necessary protection for the defendant because the events may move so far away from the underlying facts."</p>

The couples were legally married in Utah after a judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's same-sex marriage ban in December, but before the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state on January 6. The state has now placed recognition of the same-sex marriages <a href="https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-sues-utah-not-recognizing-valid-marriages-same-sex-couples">on hold indefinitely</a> [press release]. The complaint states that once the couples were legally married under Utah law, they immediately gained rights relating to the validity and recognition of their marriage, which are protected by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Legal director of the <a href="http://www.acluutah.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Utah</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], John Mejia, stated, "[e]ven our attorney general said that the marriages were entitled to full recognition by the state at the time they were performed. Regardless of what ultimately happens in the federal challenge to Utah's marriage ban, the marriages that already occurred are valid and must be recognized now." The original federal lawsuit challenging Utah&#8217;s same-sex marriage ban remains on appeal before the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website]. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a widely debated issue in the US and the cause for recent controversy in the state of Utah. The Utah Attorney General originally filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">application for stay</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court on January 2, to block same-sex marriages pending the state's appeal of December's district court decision, which struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban. The day after the Supreme Court responded by temporarily halting the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state, the office of Utah Governor Gary Herbert sent an e-mail to state Cabinet members, directing them to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-governor-directs-cabinet-not-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">place legal recognition of same-sex marriages within the state on hold</a> [JURIST report] until further notice. On January 10, US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed in the state of Utah, despite the state's determination that it will put recognition of the same-sex marriages on hold indefinitely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Greek government was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jg_HUg_eT0dOfwHMPzD_NDGyr_Dg?docId=588cbb23-a1a6-404a-8561-93f24de73166">required</a> [AFP report] to make certain cuts as a condition of its international bailout plan. According to recent reports, the decision was <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1c98b3a0-82a8-11e3-9d7e-00144feab7de.html">leaked</a> [FT report] to Athens media and legal community prior to its official publication, which was not to be announced for another several weeks. Officials expect salary repayment to be backdated to 2012, the year of the proposed bailout and legislation supporting its efforts. Under the 2012 plan, the Greek government should continue to receive funding through 2016, but support from the European Union and European Central Bank was scheduled to end this year. 

<p>The austerity measure that faces heavy criticism was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/greece-parliament-approves-austerity-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/">Greek Parliament</a> [official website, in Greek] in February 2012 securing a second bailout for the country to avoid bankruptcy amidst rioting and violence in downtown Athens. Tension was sparked right after the 199-74 vote for the austerity measure when protesters and police officials clashed resulting in looting and burning of buildings. <a href="http://www.primeminister.gov.gr/english/lucas-papademos/">Prime Minister Lucas Papademos</a> [official profile] warned that rejecting the measure would jeopardize Greece's standing in the European community. In July of 2011, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the Commissioner on Human Rights</a> [official website] Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Cephas Lumina, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-warns-greece-austerity-could-harm-basic-human-rights.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Greece that implementation of previous austerity measures to solve its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">economic crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] could result in serious violations of basic human rights. The Greek Parliament passed previous austerity measures with $40 billion in budget cuts, in addition to selling $72 billion in state assets, under pressure from them <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), the EU and the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> [official websites], which want to stave off Europe's first sovereign default.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plan's opponents claimed the state failed to properly account for many of its residents in its redistricting efforts. In the decision of the District Court, Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown held that the plan's challengers not only failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction, stating that the decision to enjoin an impending election is so serious that the Supreme Court has allowed elections to go forward even in the face of an undisputed constitutional violation, but that relief under their mal-apportionment claim was impossible, and was therefore unable to be granted. 

<p>Under the state's 2012 Reapportionment Plan, the Reapportionment Commission extracted tens of thousands of military personnel, dependents and students from the 2010 Census population of "usual residents." Voters challenging the plan claimed that the extraction <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/21/supreme-court-hawaii_n_4637287.html">wrongfully excluded</a> [Huffington Post report] these individuals, resulting in an unfair and significant shift in the voting rolls.

In ruling, the court <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-25822585">nullified the death sentences</a> [BBC report] of 15 prisoners, some of whom were convicted of aiding in the murder of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and of associating with well known bandit Veerappan. The 15 convicts challenged their death sentences on grounds that the government failed to respond to their "mercy" petitions within a reasonable time. <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/sjud/psathasivam.htm">Chief Justice P. Sathasivam</a> [official profile] ruled that the government is obligated to inform death row prisoners with respect to the status of their mercy petitions without inexplicable delay. Reports indicate the ruling will likely have implications for many of the approximately 400 prisoners currently on death row in India. 

<p>The death penalty remains a contentious issue in India. In April India's high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/india-supreme-court-upholds-death-sentence.php">upheld a death penalty sentence</a> [JURIST report] against Devinderpal Singh Bhullar, a convicted terrorist. The ruling allowed the Indian government to continue a trend toward use of execution that began in November after a de facto moratorium on its use since 2004. Also in April Indian President Pranab Mukherjee signed into law an anti-rape bill <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/india-president-approves-anti-rape-bill.php">providing for life terms and death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for offenders in addition to punishment for acid attacks, stalking and voyeurism. In March the Indian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/india-high-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-1993-mumbai-bombings.php">upheld the death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for one of the plotters of the 1993 Mumbai serial bombings that killed 257 people. In February Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri militant who received the death penalty for participating in the 2001 attack on India's parliament, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/india-parliament-attack-plotter-executed-after-president-refuses-to-grant-clemency.php">executed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

SmithKline Beecham filed suit against Abbott Laboratories in federal court alleging, among other things, violations of a licensing agreement and various antitrust laws related to HIV medication transactions. During voir dire, Abbot used its first preemptory strike against "the only self-identified gay member of the venire." The jury returned a verdict partly in favor of Abbot, and SmithKline demanded a new trial on grounds that Abbot's preemptory strike was discriminatory. On appeal, Judge Stephen Reinhardt ordered a new trial, concluding: <blockquote>Jury service is one of the most important responsibilities of an American citizen. For most citizens the honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process. It gives gay and lesbian individuals a means of articulating their values and a voice in resolving controversies that affect their lives as well as the lives of all others. To allow peremptory strikes because of assumptions based on sexual orientation is to revoke this civic responsibility, demeaning the dignity of the individual and threatening the impartiality of the judicial system .... Permitting a strike based on sexual orientation would send the false message that gays and lesbians could not be trusted to reason fairly on issues of great import to the community or the nation .... Strikes based on preconceived notions of the identities, preferences, and biases of gays and lesbians reinforce and perpetuate ... stereotypes. The Constitution cannot countenance state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice.</blockquote>The court applied "heightened scrutiny" to legal distinctions based upon sexual orientation, thereby adding another voice to a growing circuit court split on the issue. The decision has led some to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/us/sexual-orientation-is-no-basis-for-jury-exclusion-a-federal-appeals-court-rules.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0">posit</a> [NYT report] that the US Supreme Court now has greater incentive to resolve the issue should it arise.

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has recently been a controversial issue in the US. In November a judge for the US District Court for the District of New Jersey <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-upholds-new-jerseys-ban-on-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a New Jersey law banning the use of sexual orientation conversion therapy. Also in November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/senate-approves-employee-non-discrimination-act.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] outlawing workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) outlaws workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. In October the Missouri Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/missouri-supreme-court-ruling-denies-same-sex-partner-survivor-benefits.php">rejected the claim</a> [JURIST report] of a deceased state highway patrol trooper's same-sex partner that the state's survivor benefits statute violated his equal protection rights under the Missouri Constitution by denying him benefits based on his sexual orientation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Protests began in November after the Ukrainian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] a proposed <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">trade pact</a> [EU backgrounder] with the EU.

In her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14187&LangID=E">press release</a> [text] Pillay stated her concern the new laws have the potential, "to curtail the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the right to information, the right of civil society to work freely. The laws also have the potential to result in impunity for human rights violations." A spokesperson for Ban issued in his statement last night stating that the Secretary General "reiterates his appeal to all concerned to act with restraint, avoid any further escalation and violence and to uphold the democratic principles of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly." Both UN officials stressed the need for urgent action to ratchet down tensions before increasing violence and unrest makes dialogue more difficult.

<p>Earlier this week the EU <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-calls-on-ukraine-to-repeal-anti-protest-laws.php">issued a statement</a> urging the Ukrainian government to repeal anti-protest laws signed into law by Yanukovich last week.

After protests first began in November Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/ukraine-president-proposes-amnesty-for-anti-government-demonstrators.php">offered amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to those detained while participating in the country's recent anti-government protests. The proposal was made during a roundtable discussion with opposition leaders. In November Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/jailed-opposition-leader-in-ukraine-pledges-hunger-strike-in-support-of-demonstrators.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that she would go on a hunger strike to show her support for the demonstrators who have been protesting the decision to abandon the EU trade pact. The pact, <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/ukraine-president-signs-law-to-improve-prison-conditions.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in September, would have improved prison conditions and taken one step closer to integration with the EU by allowing the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, a step by the Ukrainian government toward economic and political integration with the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/wr2014_web_0.pdf">World Report 2014</a> [text, PDF], HRW said the US focused too much on peace talks with Syria rather than putting "real pressure" on Assad's regime to end the atrocities against its citizens. "As the Geneva II peace talks begin, with uncertain prospects of success, they shouldn't become the latest excuse to avoid action to protect Syrian civilians," HRW Executive Director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/kenneth-roth">Kenneth Roth</a> [official profile] said. "This requires real pressure to stop the killing and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid they need to survive." The report also accuses Russia and China of continually protecting the Syrian government from international action despite a rising death toll. "The international community seems all too willing to let the killing of Syrian civilians continue. Some governments reinforce their apathy by promoting the narrative of ruthless combatants killing each other, whether the Syrian military, Hezbollah, or jihadists. ... Urgency, rather than complacency, should be the order of the day."

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years, and there is mounting international pressure to find an end to the conflict. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [UN backgrounder] yesterday. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the current regime. UN pressure on Syria has mounted in the last month as evidence revealed signs of war crimes in the country. Last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-syria-executions-may-be-war-crimes.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian opposition groups that eyewitness reports of mass executions are violations of human rights and may amount to war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit argues that Florida's marriage laws violate the US Constitution by denying same-sex couples the legal protections and equal dignity that having the freedom to marry provides. "Today the majority of Floridians stand with us as we take this historic step toward marriage equality in the Sunshine State," Equality Florida Institute chief executive officer Nadine Smith said. "These couples have been embraced by their families and communities, but every day, Florida laws are denying them the protections and dignity that every family deserves. These harmful laws are outdated and out of step. It is time for all families in our state to have full equality of the law." The ban was added to the state's constitution in 2008 after approval by voters. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been an intensely debated issue in the US. Earlier this month US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed in the state of Utah. In November Illinois became the fifteenth US state to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/illinois-house-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">legalize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage. Earlier in November, a federal judge in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-allows-ohio-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit seeking the recognition of same-sex marriages on Ohio death certificates could continue. Also in November a Colorado same-sex couple <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-couple-seeks-to-overturn-state-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a marriage license. Earlier that week a Missouri court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/missouri-supreme-court-ruling-denies-same-sex-partner-survivor-benefits.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex partner survivor benefits. In October JURIST Guest Columnist Theodore Seto argued the fallout from the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] decision is only beginning <a href="/forum/2013/10/theodore-seto-windsor-fallout.php">to show the role state governments will have</a> [JURIST op-ed] in state constitutional modification, in addition to the possibility that a same-sex marriage case will reach the US Supreme Court in the future. In September a Kentucky judge issued a ruling in the opposite direction, holding that partners in a same-sex couple <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">must testify against one another</a> [JURIST report] because same-sex partners are not protected by the husband-wife privilege under state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Koh partially <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/201362938/14-01-21-Apple-v-Samsung-Summary-Judgment-Order">granted</a> [order] Apple's motion for summary judgment, finding that no reasonable jury could fail to find that Samsung infringed upon Apple's "word recommendation" patent. The remaining claims, for which Koh denied summary judgment, will be presented to a jury in March. A spokesman for Samsung <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25842637">expressed disappointment</a> [BBC report] with Koh's decision and stated that Samsung "remains confident" that its products do not infringe Apple's intellectual property. The two companies will hold settlement discussions before February 19 in the hope of avoiding further litigation.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been involved in a <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] that spans four continents. The litigation began in 2010 when both companies filed lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. In November a jury <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/us-jury-awards-apple-290-million-in-patent-battle-with-samsung.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] Apple $209 million after finding that Samsung copied a number of iPhone features.

In October the Obama administration upheld a decision by the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/index.htm">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] to ban some Samsung for infringing on Apple's designs.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mirowski Family Ventures</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] reversing the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website]. While the Supreme Court held that the Federal Circuit had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case, it found that the Federal Circuit improperly placed the burden of persuasion on Medtronic as the party seeking declaratory judgment. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated:<blockquote>[I]n a licensee's declaratory judgment action, the burden of proving infringement should remain with the patentee. ... To shift the burden depending upon the form of the action could create postlitigation uncertainty about the scope of the patent. ... If the burden shifts ... both sides might lose as to infringement, leaving the infringement question undecided, creating uncertainty among the parties and others who seek to know just what products and processes they are free to use.</blockquote>The decision reversed the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Medtronic_Inc_v_Boston_Scientific_Corp_695_F3d_1266_104_USPQ2d_13/1">ruling</a> [opinion] by the Federal Circuit and remanded for further proceedings. 

<p>The case arose when Medtronic brought declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court in Delaware against Mirowski for infringing on its patents. The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-treaty-powers-patent-infringement.php">oral argument</a> on the case in November after <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-adds-5-cases-to-next-years-docket.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-8561_bqm2.pdf">Paroline v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF], the court is considering whether a causal relationship must exist under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2259">18 USC &#167; 2259</a> [text] between a defendant's conduct and the victim's harm in order for the victim to recover restitution. Doyle Paroline was convicted of possessing child pornography, including two childhood images of "Amy" being abused by her uncle. Paroline is appealing the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's decision, in which the court <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Paroline_v_Unknown_701_F3d_749_5th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] that there was no requirement for the defendant to be the proximate cause of the victim's harm, which makes the defendant responsible to the victim for restitution for all losses suffered by the victim. Other federal appellate courts interpreted &#167; 2259 as requiring proximate cause, such as a Second Circuit <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/10-3160/10-3160_opn-2011-09-15.pdf?1316105875">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in a 2011 case also involving Amy that a victim of child pornography can only seek restitution from the person who created the image, not mere subsequent possessors of the image. The Supreme Court's ruling will settle the circuit split.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1493_2135.pdf">Abramski v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF], the Supreme Court is considering whether the <a href="http://www.keepandbeararms.com/laws/gca68.htm">Gun Control Act of 1968</a> [text] permits a lawful gun-purchaser to refrain from stating that they are the actual buyer when purchasing a gun for another person. Bruce Abramski purchased a handgun for his uncle, indicating on required forms that he was the "actual buyer" of the gun even though prior to the purchase, his uncle had sent Abramski a check for the cost of the gun, and following the purchase, Abramski transferred ownership to his uncle. Both men are lawful gun owners. Following the transfer of ownership, Abramski was prosecuted for making a false statement in claiming he was the "actual buyer." Abramski appeals from the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Abramski_706_F3d_307_4th_Cir_2013_Court_Opinion">held</a> [opinion] that the identity of the purchaser is always a fact material to the sale and that the gun dealer was required to record the identity of the intended owner. Although the federal appellate courts uniformly agree that a buyer's intent to resell a gun to someone who could not lawfully purchase the gun violates the Gun Control Act, the Fourth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits have split with the Fifth and Ninth Circuits over whether it is also a violation of the Gun Control Act when the ultimate recipient can lawfully buy a gun. The Supreme Court's decision in this case will settle the circuit split. </p>]]></content:encoded>

When Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 the EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/romania/ro_accompanying_measures_1206_en.pdf">established</a> [commission decision, PDF] a special "cooperation and verification mechanism" to address shortcomings in judicial reform, corruption and organized crime in those countries. The CVM has set certain benchmarks Romania must reach. According to the report, in 2012 the Commission<blockquote>received a large number of representations from judicial institutions concerning direct criticism by politicians and politically motivated media attacks on individual judges, prosecutors and members of their families, as well as on judicial and prosecutorial institutions.</blockquote> Among the key concerns for the EU is a 2013 bill passed by the Romanian parliament that would effectively take lawmakers out of the scope of legislation covering corruption offenses. The bill was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/romania-court-finds-immunity-law-unconstitutional.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ccr.ro/en">Constitutional Court of Romania</a> [official website] earlier this month. Judicial data presented in the report points out that 28 Romanian parliamentarians have been convicted or are on trial for corruption. The report labeled recent appointments of high-level judicial officials as "mixed," pointing to appointments of head and deputy heads of section in the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) where procedural anomalies in the nomination process indicate corrupt practices. Just prior to the release of the EU's report, the US top diplomat in Romania, <a href="http://romania.usembassy.gov/embassy/dcm.html">Duane Butcher</a> [official profile] <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/22/uk-eu-romania-idUKBREA0L0YF20140122">voiced the opinion</a> [Reuters report] that doubt's about Romania's justice system could harm the nation's economy. In remarks on Wednesday before the Bucharest Stock Exchange Butcher <a href="http://romania.usembassy.gov/policy/charge/pr-01222014.html">warned</a> [text] that,"investors will hesitate to come to Romania and those already on the ground will not expand their investments if the playing field is not level, or the rule of law is not consistently enforced. The Charge d'Affaires also reiterated the US commitment to maintain its alliance with Romania and aid in the fight against corruption and the enforcement of the rule of law.  

<p>Romania is one of the most corrupt nations in the EU, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#ROU_DataResearch_SurveysIndices">ranking</a> [TI profile] just ahead of Greece, and 69 out of the 177 nations globally according the watchdog group <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website]. In September Romanian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/romania-prosecutors-charge-former-prison-chief-with-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Communist-era prison commander Alexander Visinescu with genocide. Visinescu, the former chief of the Ramnicu Sarat prison under Communist dictator <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/7903325/Nicolae-Ceausescu-a-profile-of-the-former-communist-dictator.html">Nicolae Ceausescu</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] faces genocide charges for beating and starving political prisoners between 1956 and 1963, the height of Communist repression against dissidents. Last January the <a href="http://www.just.ro/">Bucharest Appeals Court</a> [official website, in Romanian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/romanian-court-approves-extradition-of-ex-defense-official-to-us.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a former Romanian defense ministry official can be extradited to the US on charges of trying to illegally export military equipment to Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lebedev's release came four months early, with the remainder of his sentence considered time served. Khodorkovsky was released from prison <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/khodorkovsky-pardoned-by-putin-released-from-jail.php">following a pardon</a> [JURIST report] in December from Russian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin&page=2">news archive</a>]. Despite the pardon, he <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/russia-shuts-door-on-khodorkovsky-return-as-lebedev-to-be-freed.html">remains liable</a> [Bloomberg report] for 17.5 billion rubles ($514 million) in tax claims against his company, Yukos Oil Co. The oil tycoon, who left for Berlin following his pardon, has said that he <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/b12b605238184837b82ea6dc1936699a/russias-high-court-frees-khodorkovskys-business-partner-but-leaves-huge-tax-claim-in-place.html">will not return to Russia</a> [AP report] unless the charges are dropped for fear that they will be used to keep him from leaving the country again. Both Khodorkovsky and Lebedev spent more than 10 years in prison.

<p>In August the Supreme Court of Russia <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/russia-court-reduces-khodorkovsky-sentence.php">reduced Khodorkovsky's prison sentence by two months</a> [JURIST report]. Khodorkovsky and his former business partner Platon Lebedev were each serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering. In 2010 former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] testified that Putin had <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Khodorkovsky for political reasons. Kasyanov stated that Putin indicated that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without approval from the president, prompting his arrest. In late 2012 the <a href="http://www.anticorruption.bg/ombudsman/eng/readnews.php?id=6081&lang=en&t_style=tex&l_style=default">Human Rights Ombudsman</a> [backgrounder] in Russia, <a href="http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/People/Luk/lukin1.html">Vladimir Lukin</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russian-human-rights-official-appeals-ruling-against-khodorkovsky.php">filed an appeal </a>[JURIST report] in a Moscow court following the ruling against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, because the two men were ordered to pay restitution for the same losses twice, once in 2005 and once in 2010. In the same month, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-court-reduces-khodorkovsky-sentence.php">had their sentences commuted</a> [JURIST report] by the Moscow City Court from 13 years to 11 years, making both men eligible for release in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report focuses heavily on the continued detention of individuals that have been approved for transfer, including a group of Yemeni detainees held in Guantanamo because of security situations in their home countries. Erika Guevara Rosas, director of AI's Americas program,condemned the prison's operation five years after President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the facility stating that the detainees "access to remedy has systematically been blocked and accountability minimal." The report calls on US authorities to "ensure independent and impartial investigations into all credible allegations of human rights violations carried out at Guantanamo and against detainees held elsewhere." According to the advocacy group over 150 prisoners still remain interned at Guantanamo, and many have been held without charge or trial.

<p>The treatment of prisoners at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has raised humanitarian concerns internationally, and in recent months the US has <a href="/forum/2013/11/jeffrey-addicott-ghailani-combatant.php">grappled</a> [JURIST op-ed] with the complexities of the laws of war and the legal rights of due process for detainees. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-appeals-court-denies-claim-for-damages-by-former-guantanamo-claim.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lower court was correct in dismissing the claim for damages brought by Abdul Rahim Abdul Razak Al Janko, a former Guantanamo detainee, on jurisdictional grounds. Earlier in January the panel review board (PRB) administered by the US Department of Defense (DOD) under <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/executive-order-periodic-review-individuals-detained-guant-namo-bay-nava">Executive Order 13567</a> [text] concluded its first review and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/guantanamo-panel-closes-first-review-ruling-detainee-to-be-released.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] a former Guantanamo detainee for transfer to Yemen. A week prior three Uighur Muslim detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/last-uighur-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">transferred</a> to Slovakia and in December of last year two Guantanamo detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-transfers-2-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudi-arabia.php">transferred</a> [JURIST reports] to Saudi Arabia. Also last December the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/dc-circuit-affirms-habeas-denial-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a denial of a writ of habeas corpus for a Guantanamo detainee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The board's dissenters, along with Rep. <a href="http://mikerogers.house.gov/">Mike Rogers</a> (R-MI), chairman of the<a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/"> House Intelligence Committee</a> [official websites], defended the metadata program, with Rogers calling the board's legal analysis unwarranted. 

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this month US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-pledges-an-end-to-nsas-mass-collection-practices.php">announced detailed plans</a> [JURIST report] to change surveilance policy, curbing the abilities of intelligence agencies to collect and use American phone data. Also this month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/gathering-phone-records-unlawful.php">appeal </a>to a federal district court ruling that held that the NSA program is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">likely unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. In September the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">released </a>[JURIST report] a previously classified <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/791759/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">opinion </a>[text, PDF] explaining why an NSA program to keep records of Americans' phone calls is constitutional. Also in September the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers. In August the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/council-of-europe-rights-body-questions-uk-on-reaction-to-us-surveillance-program.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the UK reaction to the exposure of the US surveillance program. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who came forward in early June as the whistleblower in the<a href="/feature/2013/07/prism-podcast.php"> NSA surveillance scandal</a> [JURIST podcast]. JURIST Guest Columnist Christina Wells argues that the broad provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], under which Snowden is charged,<a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php"> raise significant First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Herring explained his position saying, "After thorough legal review, I have now concluded that Virginia's ban on marriage same sex couples violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution on two grounds: marriage is a fundamental right being denied to some Virginians, and the ban unlawfully discriminates on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender." Herring's choice to refuse to defend the law is rare but not unprecedented. Former Virginia attorney general Jerry Kilgore joined with 43 other state attorneys general in a legal brief to argue that an attorney general is properly carrying out his constitutional duties when he seeks to invalidate a law that he believes to be unconstitutional. Virginia's <a href="https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/virginia-attorney-general-finds-state-marriage-ban-unconstitutional">shift in legal position</a> [press release] came after the inauguration of <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/about/governors-bio/">Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website], who replaced Bob McDonnell after he was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25836639">indicted for accepting gifts while in office</a> [BBC report], and Herring replaced Ken Cuccinelli as attorney general. The previous administration defended the same-sex marriage ban. 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges before numerous state and federal courts. In October <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/index.php">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/national-gay-rights-organization-files-lawsuit-against-west-viriginias-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in West Virginia challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. In September an Illinois judge allowed two lawsuits challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/illinois-judge-permits-same-sex-marriages-cases-to-go-to-trial.php">proceed to trial</a> [JURIST report]. Also in September a New Jersey judge ruled that same-sex couples must be <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/new-jersey-judge-rules-same-sex-couples-must-be-allowed-to-marry.php">allowed to marry</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in the month two lawsuits were filed in Pennsylvania seeking recognition for same-sex marriages <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/pennsylvania-couple-files-federal-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">performed outside the state</a>, as well as marriages <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/pennsylvania-same-sex-couples-ask-court-to-affirm-their-marriages.php">performed within the state</a> [JURIST reports] when a county clerk was issuing same-sex marriage licenses despite a state ban.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/">UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide</a> <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/adviser.shtml">Adama Dieng</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46811&Cr=central+african+republic&Cr1=#.UuFUM_Yo7-k">warned</a> [UN News Centre report] on Thursday that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=central+african+republic">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [JURIST news archive]. Dieng reported, "Given the serious nature of continuing violations in an environment of complete impunity, CAR is on the brink of descending into atrocity crimes." After Dieng's visit to CAR, he reported that the year-long conflict has escalated to violence between Muslims and Christians. This conflict has forced children to abandon their homes and many have been recruited by armed groups. The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [advocacy group] <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_71547.html">estimated</a> [press release] that 2.3 million children have been affected by the conflict in CAR. UNICEF also estimated that, on average, three people were killed in fighting every hour last week alone. The UN has found that Christians and Muslims have focused attacks in Bangui over the last two weeks. 

<p>There has been growing international concern over gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150044">seized the nations capital</a> [BBC backgrounder] in March of 2013. The UN reported on Sunday that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier this month, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR. Also in December, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to authorize the deployment of peacekeepers to CAR. In November, Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violence-in-the-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the continued violence between militias, rebels and government forces in CAR threatened to lead the country into renewed conflict. UN Sectetary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels last March and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order."</p>]]></content:encoded>

ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/01/icc-delays-start-kenya-president-trial-2014123191417858530.html">asked for a new start date</a> [Al Jazeera report] after considering the sufficiency of the evidence against Kenyatta. In the order to vacate the February 5 trial date, the court also addressed other procedural matters, ordering the prosecution to file a response in relation to the new issues raised in the defense's response by January 31. The order followed Kenyatta's defense team filing of a confidential request on January 13 for the court to "terminate the proceedings ... on the grounds of insufficiency of evidence." A public version of the request must be filed by January 28. The prosecution's case has been weakened after several key witnesses have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/23/us-kenya-icc-kenyatta-idUSBREA0M1HK20140123">withdrawn their testimony</a> [Reuters report]. Kenyatta has denied all charges of crimes against humanity relating to his role in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">2007 post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive]. Kenyan <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Deputy President William Ruto</a> [ICC materials; JURIST <a href="jurist_search.php?q=ruto">news archive</a>] is also facing trial.

<p>Kenyatta and Ruto are facing trial for crimes against humanity for their alleged involvement in inciting the violence that followed the 2007 Kenyan election which led to more than 1,100 deaths. This makes Ruto the first senior serving politician to appear in an international court. Earlier this month the Trial Chamber of the ICC <a href="paperchase/2014/01/icc-grants-kenya-leaders-request-to-skip-parts-of-pending-trial.php">made an oral ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Ruto may be conditionally excused from attending his trial on a continuous basis. In November, however, the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/icc-reverses-ruling-excusing-kenya-president-from-continuous-presence-at-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report], reversing a previous ruling, that Kenyatta may not excused from parts of his crimes against humanity trial. In September 2013, Kenya's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion</a> [JURIST report] to leave the ICC. The ICC decided to continue with the trials despite the vote, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">having rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to move the trials to Kenya or Tanzania in July.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a brief statement, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos stated:<blockquote>I am deeply concerned about reports of alarming levels of violence, including the killing of many civilians and a policeman, in Maungdaw Township, Rakhine State, Myanmar. I ask the Government of Myanmar to take all necessary measures to ensure the full protection of all civilians and to enable safe and continued access by humanitarian staff to the affected areas in order to assess needs and provide emergency assistance to all those affected by the recent violence. I also ask the Government to immediately launch an impartial investigation into these events and to respect the rights of those arrested and detained in connection with this incident.</blockquote>Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tomas Ojea Quintana from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official websites] have <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46987&Cr=myanmar&Cr1=#.UuHPSWQo49c">echoed</a> [UN News Centre report] Amos' concerns.

<p>In October Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-conflict-in-rakhine-continues-to-inspire-sectarian-violence-in-myanmar.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that sectarian violence between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State is contributing to wider anti-Muslim sentiments in Myanmar, threatening the positive changes undertaken by the country in the past two years. While Quintana acknowledged that Myanmar's government has demonstrated willingness to address the situation, he expressed concern that discriminatory acts against Muslims remain unattended. Earlier that month Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-welcomes-myanmars-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the release of 56 prisoners of conscience in Myanmar, although he stressed the need for legislative reforms that would address the injustice against prisoners of conscience. In August <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Myanmar's government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/myanmar-urged-to-revise-draft-association-law.php">revise its draft association laws</a> [JURIST report], which, if enacted, would require nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to obtain official registration to operate and would impose criminal penalties on NGOs that failed to register. Earlier in August Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-urges-reconciliation-in-myanmar.php">applauded</a> [JURIST report] recent government efforts to encourage a culture of respect between clashing political and religious sects but recognized the need for increased government action on a wide array of issues. In July Quntana <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/myanmar-un-rights-expert-welcomes-latest-release-of-prisoners-of-conscience.php">praised the release</a> [JURIST report] of 73 prisoners of consciousness in Myanmar.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though <a href="http://presidentofnepal.gov.np/Contents/president.html">President Ram Baran Yadav</a> [official website] was initially elected to serve only two years, he has been in office since 2008, soon after the <a href="http://www.can.gov.np/en">Constituent Assembly of Nepal</a> (CA) [official website] voted to abolish the country's monarchy and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-constituent-assembly-abolishes.php">establish a republic</a> [JURIST report]. Disputes among political parties regarding presidential authority and selection, as well as the failure to draft a new constitution, have led to Yadav's retention of power. Arguments over whether Yadav should stay in office has been a politically controversial issue.

<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-sg-disappointed-with-nepals-failure-to-meet-deadline-for-new-constitution.php">expressed disappointment</a> [JURIST report] with Nepal in May for its failure to meet the deadline to write a new constitution.

The CA, responsible for drafting the constitution, was elected to a two-year term in 2008, but the term has already been extended four times despite its <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nepal-assembly-pledges-to-finish-draft.php">pledge</a> [JURIST report] to finish it by the end of April 2010.

The <a href="http://www.kjrh.com/news/state/judge-throws-out-oklahoma-morningafter-pill-bill_79420991_">law requires</a> [AP report] women younger than 17 to obtain a prescription and show photo ID in order to receive Plan B One-Step and other generic emergency contraceptive pills. Women 17 and older would be allowed to receive the contraceptives over-the-counter. The law was passed in May as a response to the federal government making the contraceptive pills available over-the-counter to everyone. Opponents of the law argued it was overly restrictive, pointing out that it is the only law targeting emergency contraception in the nation. Supporters of the restriction claim they were seeking to maintain the status quo of Oklahoma. 

<p>Earlier this month Justice Sonia Sotomayor <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-justice-blocks-contraception-mandate-in-lawsuit.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an emergency temporary injunction blocking the enforcement of the contraception mandate in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>]. Oklahoma's law has become increasingly controversial. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/oklahoma-rights-group-challenges-law-limiting-sale-of-emergency-contraception.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] is the latest challenge to reproductive rights-related legislation adopted in Oklahoma. Prior to the passage of HB 2226 in May of this year, the text of the law was attached to another statute governing insurance forms. It was struck down for breaking the state's constitutional one-issue rule, requiring all laws to address only one subject. In July JURIST Guest Columnist Adam Banner <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/adam-banner-bill-1970.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] an order by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] for the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-issues-final-orders-of-term.php">clarify</a> its <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] in <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110765.html">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice v. Cline</a> [opinion], which ruled that Oklahoma's <a href="http://e-lobbyist.com/gaits/text/287092">HB 1970</a> [text], a law attempting to regulate the use of "abortion-inducing" pills, was an undue burden on a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

These executions come mere days after the country's <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/iraqi-government-executes-26-convicted-for-terrorism-offenses.php">execution of 26 Iraqi nationals</a> [JURIST report], also for terrorist related offenses. Thursday's acts bring the total number of Iraqi executions this week to 37. Human rights groups have long opposed the use of capital punishment in Iraq and the overarching legal system employed in the country, where reports of torture and forced confessions have surfaced. According to an annual <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2014/country-chapters/iraq">report</a> [2014 world report] on Iraq by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], Iraq executed at least 151 people in 2013, up from 129 in 2012, and 68 in 2011. According to the report, up to 48 criminal offenses are subject to the death penalty under Iraqi law. Iraqi officials defend capital punishment on the grounds it is sanctioned by Islam and it is an effective way to curb violence in the country.

<p>Authorities in Iraq have led a significant crackdown on alleged domestic terrorists in recent months and the treatment of prisoners continues to bring concern from major international groups. In December Iraqi police <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/iraqi-police-arrest-sunni-mp-and-protest-supporter-on-terrorism-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a prominent supporter of anti-government protests and charged him with terrorism offenses. Earlier in December UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-experts-call-on-iraqi-government-to-provide-whereabouts-of-7-camp-ashraf-residents.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iraq to provide information on the whereabouts of seven prisoners who were reportedly abducted following the massacre at Camp Ashraf in September. Last October Iraq officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/iraqi-officials-execute-42-people-convicted-on-terrorism-charges.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 42 people convicted of terrorism charges. Despite a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-iraq-execution-practices.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx"> Navi Pallay</a> [UN backgrounder] last April, criminal executions in Iraq show no signs of stopping. JURIST Columnist Haider Ala Hamoudi of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law <a href="/forum/2013/12/haider-hamoudi-iraqi-constitutional.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that as Iraq's new government matures the country must address critical issues left ambiguous in the initial constitution and the execution style killings demand urgent attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Asghar was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/01/pakistan-sentences-man-death-blasphemy-2014124104727553298.html">convicted</a> [Al Jazeera report] under <a href="http://www.pakistanlaw.net/pakistan-law/blasphemy-laws-pakistan/">Section 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code</a> [text, PDF], making it illegal to make derogatory remarks about the Prophet Mohammed. He received the maximum sentence after confessing to writing the letters. <a href="http://www.jpp.org.pk/">Justice Pakistan Project</a> [advocacy website] argued Asghar suffered from a mental illness, but the court rejected this claim, despite him reportedly being treated for paranoid schizophrenia. It is unlikely Asghar's death sentence will be carried out, given Pakistan's unofficial moratorium on the death penalty that has been in effect since 2008. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy+law">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] are currently in effect in several countries around the world. Blasphemy laws in Pakistan carry <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-president-blasphemy-laws-must-not-be-misused.php">penalties</a> [JURIST report] ranging from a fine to capital punishment. In November Ireland's constitutional convention <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ireland-constitutional-convention-recommendes-replacing-blasphemy-ban.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] replacing the blasphemy ban. In August a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-dismisses-charges-again-cleric-in-blasphemy-case.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] charges against a cleric in a blasphemy case. In August 2012 Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said that the country's blasphemy laws would not be misused to persecute religious beliefs. Zardari's comments came after the young girl's arrest.  In July the US Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-state-department-releases-religious-freedom-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual International Religious Freedom Report, documenting threats to religious freedom throughout the world.

Former Serbian prime minister Nikola Sainovic's sentence was reduced from 22 to 18 years imprisonment, while former Yugoslav army chief of staff Nebojsa Pavkovic's 22-year sentence was affirmed. Generals Vladimir Lazarevic and Sreten Lukic had their sentences reduced from 15 to 14 years and 22 to 20 years, respectively.

According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, two senior CIA officials were seen delivering cardboard boxes containing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-hidden-history-of-the-cias-prison-in-poland/2014/01/23/b77f6ea2-7c6f-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html">$15 million in cash</a> [WP report] to the US Embassy in Warsaw in early 2003. The cash was soon delivered to the Polish intelligence headquarters, a payment made in exchange for access to a remote prison in northern Poland. Officials from the Polish government have continued to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/24/us-usa-poland-prison-idUSBREA0N0ML20140124">deny</a> [Reuters report] the existence of a secret CIA jail within their borders.

<p>Under the CIA's extraordinary rendition program, terrorism suspects were seized and flown to secret locations outside the US for interrogation and imprisonment. The Polish site was allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">the largest CIA detention facility in Europe</a> [JURIST report].

USIS was contracted by the DOJ to perform background checks on individuals at varying levels. The DOJ alleges the USIS faked more than 665,000 background checks they were contracted to perform between March 2008 and September 2012. This number accounts for almost 40 percent of the total background checks USIS performed in that period. The complaint alleges the practice of "dumping" detailed as: <blockquote>"Beginning in at least March 2008 and continuing through at least September 2012, USIS management devised and executed a scheme to deliberately circumvent contractually required quality reviews of completed background investigations in order to increase the company's revenues and profits. Specifically, USIS devised a practice referred to internally as "dumping" or "flushing," which involved releasing cases to OPM and representing them as complete when, in fact, not all ROIs comprising those cases had received a quality review as required by the Fieldwork Contracts. USIS engaged in the practice of dumping in order to meet budgeted goals and, therefore, increase its revenues and profits. Given that USIS was paid by OPM for each completed case, the more cases USIS completed each month the more money it received from OPM."</blockquote> The complaint further details that the DOJ paid USIS anywhere from $95 to $2,500 per background check, totaling about $11.7 million. The DOJ is seeking damages including interest for the "dumped" background checks. 

<p>This is the latest development in the fall-out surrounding the Edward Snowden leaks regarding the US <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] <a href="/feature/featured/prism/"> surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. These revelations have sparked worldwide <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">debate</a> and <a href="/hotline/2013/06/samar-warsi-fourth-amendment.php">controversy</a> [JURIST op-eds]. The programs have also sparked a prolonged <a href="/forum/2014/01/marjorie-cohn-nsa-metadata.php">constitutional debate</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last month, UN Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism Ben Emmerson [official profile] stated that he plans to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-counterterrorism-official-to-investigate-us-uk-surveillance.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the surveillance activities of the NSA and the GCHQ. US Senators <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/senators-propose-overhaul-of-us-surveillance-laws.php">announced new legislation</a> [JURIST report] in September in a bipartisan effort to reform surveillance laws. Earlier that month the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] to curb the FBI's surveillance powers, despite the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's</a> [official website] release of a previously classified opinion <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">justifying</a> [JURIST report] the need for the NSA's surveillance program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Controversy grew after the arrest because Edgar Arias Tamayo was not notified of his rights under <a href="http://legal.un.org/avl/pdf/ha/vccr/vccr_e.pdf">Vienna Convention on Consular Relations </a>[text] to notify Mexican diplomats of the arrest. Because of this, Tamayo's legal team argued that Tamayo was not provided the potential legal protections of the counselor's office. The Mexican Capital Legal Assistance Program (MCLAP), funded by the Mexican government, provided legal assistance once the conviction was handed down. Tamayo also claimed he was mentally disabled and not eligible to receive the death penalty. However, the Supreme Court denied both appeals and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/012214zr1_bqmc.pdf">refused to stay</a> [order, PDF] the execution. The execution sparked an international outcry based in part because Tamayo was in the US illegally when the crime was committed. Tamayo is the fourth individual to be put to death this year.

<p>Six US states have repealed the death penalty since 2007, bringing the total to 18. One of the common rationales for this trend is that the costs associated with litigating appeals actually cost the state more than paying for a prisoner's needs for life. Those states that recently joined this trend are <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/maryland-governor-signs-bill-repealing-death-penalty.php">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports]. On the other hand, 32 states retain its use, according to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> [advocacy website]. <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/california-modifies-three-strikes-law-keeps-death-penalty-in-referendum.php">California</a> [JURIST report] voters declined to repeal the death penalty on the most recent ballot despite the fact that 47 percent of voters supported the repeal last November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perkovic, who helped create Croatia's <a href="https://www.soa.hr/en/">Security and Intelligence Agency</a> [official website] in the 1990s, has repeatedly <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/croatia-extradites-former-spy-chief-germany">denied</a> [AP report] involvement in the murder of Stjepan Djurekovic, a Croatian nationalist who had fled the country to Germany where he was killed. Germany issued an international arrest warrant for Perkovic in 2005, but Croatia refused to extradite him. Before joining the EU in July, the government of Croatia changed its laws to prevent the extradition of suspects in crimes committed before 2002, to protect veterans from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croatian War for Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. However, in August, when the European Commission warned that the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/eu-warns-croatia-on-extradition-law.php">could face legal action</a> [JURIST report] for not complying with EU extradition standards, the government removed the time restriction. Perkovic denies any wrongdoing and is expected to appeal the decision. German federal prosecutors expect Perkovic to be brought before a judge by Saturday where they will determine if he is to be held in custody while a formal indictment is pending.

<p>Croatia has faced criticism in recent years for the alleged slow pace that it has taken in investigating war crimes committed during the Croatian War of Independence. Croatia <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/croatia-court-approves-extradition-of-ex-spy-to-germany.php">approved the extradition order</a> [JURIST report] for Petrovic earlier this month. The Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/croatia-to-cooperate-with-eu-on-extradition-law.php">agreed to bring their extradition law in line</a> with EU standards in August after facing the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/eu-warns-croatia-on-extradition-law.php">threat of legal sanctions</a> [JURIST reports] from the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website]. Croatia joined the EU in July after 66% of the population <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/croatia-citizens-votes-to-join-eu.php">voted in favor of the referendum</a> [JURIST report] in January 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The concessions <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/468537-ukrainian-president-yanukovych-to-reshuffle-government-in-kiev-crisis/?photo=2">would include</a> [AP report] a change in Yanukovych's cabinet members, amnesty for many imprisoned protesters who have not been accused of serious crimes, and reform of the country's anti-protest legislation. At a meeting with religious leaders Yanukovych called for a special parliament meeting next Tuesday to push the reforms through. Yanukovych <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/01/ukraine-president-holds-talks-with-opposition-201412514402264303.html">reached out</a> [Al Jazeera report] to opposition leaders in an effort to end the crisis in a series of unannounced meetings. The formerly peaceful protests have become increasingly violent with reports of detained protesters being abused by police. The demonstrators are calling for Yanukovych to resign and for new elections to be held. Presidential allies still control a majority of parliament, despite pressure amid the clashes for members to resign.

<p>The civil unrest has gripped Ukraine for the past two months. Earlier this month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/senior-un-officials-call-for-dialogue-to-end-unrest-in-ukraine.php">called for dialogue</a> [JURIST report] between protesters and Ukraine officials to end the violence. Their statements came after Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed a controversial anti-protest bill</a> that included bans on protesters wearing masks or helmets and the dissemination of Internet slander. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-calls-on-ukraine-authorities-to-end-intimidation-tactics.php">urged Ukraine authorities to end the use of intimidation tactics</a> [JURIST report] against protesters in December.

Suthin Thararin, a protest leader for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PDRCThailand">People's Democratic Reform Committee</a> (PDRC) [Facebook page], was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-thailand-politics-vote-idUSBREA0P01N20140126">shot to death</a> [Reuters report] in front of the Sri Eiam Temple in Bangkok while demonstrators blocked a voting station, according to Police Col. Thawatkiat Jindakuansanong. On Friday, a Thai court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/world/asia/thai-constitutional-court-says-election-can-be-postponed.html?_r=0">ruled</a> [NY Times report] that elections scheduled for next month could be postponed. Police said that Thararin's death came after protesters blocked a voting station and shut it down when officials agreed to suspend the voting. Nine others were injured in the shooting. More than 45 polling stations have been closed to due obstructions made by protesters from the PDRC. Thai authorities <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] last week, giving extra power to security forces in response to the escalating violence as protesters blockaded sections of the capital.  

<p>Thai politics have been in a contentious state since the ousting of former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder] by a <a href="/forum/2006/09/disillusioned-with-democracy-tale-of.php">military coup</a> [JURIST op-ed] in 2006. In December Thai officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/thailand-refuses-to-delay-election-despite-violent-protests.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] calls to postpone the upcoming February elections but protesters have continued to advocate for a delay and have stepped up their demonstrations in response to this latest ruling by the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC). In November Thailand's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-high-court-refuses-to-allow-ruling-party-to-amend-constitution.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] the proposal to amend the nation's constitution illegal and that many legislators had acted illegally in trying to force its passing. The NACC's ruling on the conduct of the legislators themselves is the latest culmination on the issue. Thai opposition groups have <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-protesters-seek-help-overthrowing-government.php">sought help</a> [JURIST report] in trying to overthrow the current government and it is yet unclear what effect this ruling affecting 308 pro-government legislators will have on their success in doing so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Critics have argued for a change in the 'roadmap' to democracy, calling for a presidential election to take place before a potentially divisive parliamentary election.

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the Egyptian Revolution began, and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Islamic Muslim Brotherhood continue to fight the military backed government for political control in the country.

The Ukrainian civic group Spilna Sprava, translated as "Common Cause," has reportedly <a href="http://rt.com/news/ukraine-rioters-justice-ministry-226/">claimed responsibility</a> [RT report] for the Ministry of Justice raid and earlier raids at the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Energy buildings. The formerly peaceful protests have become increasingly violent with reports of detained protesters being abused by police. Ukraine <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-promises-concessions-in-response-to-spreading-protests.php">promised concessions</a> [JURIST report] on Friday in response to the growing unrest in the country. The demonstrators are calling for Yanukovych to resign and for new elections to be held. Presidential allies still control a majority of parliament, despite pressure amid the clashes for members to resign. Spilna Sprava has reportedly claimed they will reoccupy the buildings if concessions are not made.

<p>The civil unrest has gripped Ukraine for the past two months. Earlier this month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/senior-un-officials-call-for-dialogue-to-end-unrest-in-ukraine.php">called for dialogue</a> [JURIST report] between protesters and Ukraine officials to end the violence. Their statements came after Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed a controversial anti-protest bill</a> [JURIST report] that included bans on protesters wearing masks or helmets and the dissemination of Internet slander. Human Rights Watch urged Ukraine authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-calls-on-ukraine-authorities-to-end-intimidation-tactics.php">end the use of intimidation tactics</a> [JURIST report] against protesters in December. The demonstrations began earlier that month after Yanukovych rejected a planned trade pact with the EU.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

McGuire, who was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/ohio-killer-executed-with-new-lethal-drug-combo/4512651/">convicted</a> [AP report] in 1994 of raping and murdering a 22-year-old girl in 1989 and lost his <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/rod/docs/pdf/0/1997/1997-ohio-335.pdf">appeal</a> [text, PDF] to the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1997, was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">executed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] using a combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a morphine derivative. The lawsuit <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/01/24/dennis-mcguire-ohio-execution-lawsuit.html">asks the federal court to stop future executions</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report] because these drugs have not been approved by the US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] for such a purpose. McGuire's family <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/us/family-sues-in-protracted-ohio-execution.html?_r=0">is targeting</a> [AP report] <a href="http://www.hospira.com/">Hospira Inc.</a> [corporate website], the manufacturer of the drugs and is seeking damages above $75,000, claiming that the company knew that the drugs would be used for executions when they sold them to Ohio and should have known that they would cause "unnecessary and extreme pain and suffering during the execution process." McGuire's execution, during which he repeatedly gasped and snorted, was the longest lasting execution in Ohio since the state's resumption of the death penalty in 1999.

<p>The prolonged execution of Dennis McGuire has <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">stirred controversy</a> [JURIST report] over new drugs used to administer lethal injections. Earlier this month McGuire's attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-new-execution-method-causes-suffering-death-row-inmate.php">filed for a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report], claiming that the untried execution method would cause McGuire to experience a suffocation-like syndrome known as air hunger. The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-allows-untried-drug-in-ohio-lethal-injection.php">refused to halt the execution</a> [JURIST report], finding that the evidence presented failed to prove a substantial risk of severe pain. Several states that employ capital punishment have been seeking alternative lethal injection compounds after the EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/germany-urges-eu-export-ban-on-execution-drug.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] German and Danish drugmakers from selling sodium thiopental, a commonly used lethal injection compounds, to US prisons in 2011. In July the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the FDA policy that allowed the importation of the compound was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fda-cannot-allow-import-of-execution-drug.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The PPACA requires employers providing certain health care plans to cover various types of contraceptives. Religious groups seeking exemption from the contraceptive mandate must complete and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dol.gov%2Febsa%2Fpreventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc&ei=1IfmUs_1CM_gsASf34DIAw&usg=AFQjCNFqJQOklyO5rILmYwsink7tnyeLUw&sig2=0kmqx_ipahxXncTPft3QpQ&bvm=bv.59930103,d.cWc">submit a government form</a> [EBSA Form 700] setting forth the basis upon which they object. The Little Sisters, whose case against the mandate currently pends before the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], sought injunctive relief from the Supreme Court with respect to the document requirement on grounds that compliance would make them complicit in pregnancy-related services to which they object. The high court's order grants the Little Sisters exemption from the contraceptive mandate without the document, so long as they notify the government, in writing, that they object to the law on religious grounds. The court noted, however, that the order "should not be construed as an expression of the Court's views on the merits ..." of the case pending before the appellate court.

<p>Laws regulating contraception have been subject to various challenges at both the federal and state level. Earlier this month an Oklahoma state court judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/oklahoma-judge-blocks-emergency-contraception-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the state's emergency contraception law unconstitutional. In November a divided three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ppaca-contraceptive-mandate-unconstitutional-dc-circuit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the contraceptive mandate imposed by the PPACA violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. In October the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law-contraception-mandate.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] claims by Eden Foods that it should be exempt on religious grounds from the contraception mandate PPACA. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Friday that family-owned, profit-making businesses cannot challenge the new federal health care law's birth control mandate on religious grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The text, which was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25908340">passed by 200 votes</a> [BBC report] out of 216, guarantees freedom of worship, though it names Islam as the state religion and forbids "attacks on the sacred."

US Steel Corp.</a> [SCOTUS Blog backgrounder] that employees are not entitled to compensation under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [text, PDF] for time spent changing in and out of protective gear. The FLSA governs minimum wages and maximum hours for certain employees and specifically excludes the time it takes to change clothes from hours worked, unless otherwise specified in a collective bargaining agreement. A group of current and former employees at the US Steel plant in Gary, Indiana sought backpay for time spent donning and doffing protective gear, including commonly used flame-retardant gear, despite a provision in the companies collective-bargaining agreement which states that this time is noncompensable. The employee's <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v2/12-417_pet.authcheckdam.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that the word "clothes" as used in the FLSA does not include the protective gear, which is designed to guard against workplace hazards. Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Antonin Scalia rejected that argument and held that the time spent donning and doffing protective gear is not subject to compensation under the FLSA because it was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/27/usa-court-labor-idUSL2N0L10RM20140127">not sufficiently different from "changing clothes"</a> [Reuters report].

Ex-Seleka groups are supported by armed Muslim civilians, while anti-Balaka are backed by former national army soldiers. Serious violence has been reported in the Bangui neighborhoods of PK5, PK11, PK12 and PK13, causing many ex-Seleka and Muslim civilians to flee to the northern part of the country. Additionally, anti-Balaka have allegedly extended threats to international organizations that offer shelter to staff members' Muslim relatives. Violence has extended to affect civilians as well. Ex-Seleka members recently fled to the town of Bocaranga, where they opened fire on civilians, killing at least 10 people. Meanwhile, anti-Balaka reportedly killed 80 Muslim civilians and burned down approximately 4,000 houses. "We simply cannot let the social fabric of this country be torn apart. I call as a matter of utmost urgency upon the international community to strengthen peacekeeping efforts," stated Pillay. "There is a need to urgently restore security not only in Bangui but also in other parts of the country. Many lives are at stake."

<p>There has been growing international concern over gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150044">seized the nations capital</a> [BBC backgrounder] in March of 2013. Last week, the<a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/"> UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide</a> <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/adviser.shtml">Adama Dieng</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also, the UN reported last week that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier this month, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons<a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php"> urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR. Also in December, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to authorize the deployment of peacekeepers to CAR. In November, Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violence-in-the-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the continued violence between militias, rebels and government forces in CAR threatened to lead the country into renewed conflict. UN Sectetary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels last March and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gbrelia Knaul, the current Special Rapporteur, praised Qatar's achievements over the past decade in establishing an independent judiciary, but criticized the justice system there for failing to uphold basic human rights. In particular, Knaul expressed concern over issues regarding access to justice in Qatar for women, migrants and domestic workers. Additionally, Knaul called for more transparency and less executive involvement in the judiciary, especially in high profile cases. Knaul based her findings after visiting the country this month and meeting with senior government officials, judges and representatives of civil society.

<p>Qatar has faced criticism regarding its approach to basic human rights and free expression in the past.

Hoeper</a> [docket], in which a pilot sued the airline for reporting him as a security threat and calling him "mentally unstable." At issue in this case was the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/44941">Aviation and Transportation Security Act</a> (ATSA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. To encourage such reports, the ATSA provides a broad grant of immunity from suit, shielding airlines and their employees from all liability, including liability for state-law defamation. The only exception to this immunity is for reports made "with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading" or "with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure." The court concluded that Air Wisconsin was entitled to immunity by law, as such immunity "may not be denied to materially true statements." The court reversed and remanded the case, urging the public policy need "to encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to provide the TSA immediately with information about potential threats."

<p>The <a href="http://www.coloradosupremecourt.us/">Colorado Supreme Court</a> [official website] previously granted the pilot, William Hoeper, $1.4 million for the 2004 incident, when an Air Wisconsin manager reported Hoeper to the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] as a possible threat after Heoper became angry during a certification test. The Supreme Court of Colorado <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11649948009356592837&q=Air+Wisconsin+Airlines+Corp.+v.+Hoeper&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity and that the statements were false. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-in-housing-discrimination-case.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in June and <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-airline-immunity-damages-claims.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] were heard in December. At trial, counsel for Hoeper stated that the use of terms such as "mentally unstable" were unjustified and false. Meanwhile, counsel for Air Wisconsin argued that airline workers should be given greater allowance in their word choice while making an urgent phone call regarding a suspected threat.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICJ <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/137/17928.pdf">granted</a> [press release, PDF] Peru some parts of the Pacific Ocean formerly controlled by Chile but left Chile prosperous coastal fishing grounds. The decision ends disputes over the 14,670 square miles of abundant fishing waterways. Peru had wanted the maritime board to extend perpendicularly from where the land borders of the two countries meet the ocean, while Chile wanted the border to run parallel to the equator. The ICJ's decision represents a compromise by extending the border parallel to the equator for 80 nautical miles from the coastline and then continuing the border out to the southwest. The ICJ's ruling is final and cannot be appealed, and the presidents of both Peru and Chile have <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/world-court-draws-new-peru-chile-maritime-border">promised</a> [AP report] to follow the decision of the court.

US</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to relax sentencing guidelines for drug dealers. Marcus Burrage was convicted of distribution of heroin causing death under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/841">21 USC &#167; 841</a> [text], and he appealed by challenging the causation instruction the courts were using for &#167; 841. Burrage argued that the statute required the government to prove that heroin was the proximate cause of the user's death, and not just a contributing factor toward the death. The Supreme Court agreed, unanimously ruling that federal prosecutors must prove that the illegal drug actually caused the death of the user and not merely a "contributing cause" in the user's death. Burrage was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-supreme-court-heroin-dealer-sentencing-20140127,0,924086.story">serving two concurrent 20-year sentences</a> [LAT report] for distribution, but one of his 20-year convictions has been overturned by the Supreme Court's ruling. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: <blockquote>We decline to adopt the Government's permissive interpretation of &#167; 841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted requires death to "result from" use of the unlawfully distributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed. Congress could have written &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the underlying crime "contributes to" death or serious bodily injury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to cases involving concurrent causes, as five States have done. ... It chose instead to use language that imports but-for causality. Especially in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity ... we cannot give the text a meaning that is different from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that disfavors the defendant.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito refused to join a portion of Scalia's opinion, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote a separate concurring opinion.

<p>The 20 year mandatory sentencing found in &#167; 841 was enacted as part of the "<a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/detail.php#TheWaronDrugs">War on Drugs</a>" [JURIST backgrounder], and mandatory minimums stemming from statutes issued during that time have been <a href="/hotline/2014/01/angela-campbell-mandatory-minimums.php">criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In December US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/obama-commutes-sentences-of-drug-offenders.php">commuted</a> [JURIST report] the sentences of eight inmates currently serving lengthly prison terms for crack cocaine offenses, citing the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ220/pdf/PLAW-111publ220.pdf">Fair Sentencing Act of 2010</a> (FSA) [text, PDF]. The FSA reduced significant disparities in convictions of drug offenses related to crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Last August US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-to-change-policy-on-mandatory-minimum-sentences-for-drug-offenders.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] should avoid charging low-level, nonviolent drug offenders with no ties to gangs or drug cartels with crimes carrying mandatory minimum sentences. Holder outlined additional reforms as part of his <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/SMARTONCRIME.pdf">"Smart on Crime" plan</a> [text, PDF] during a speech to the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the Egyptian Revolution began in 2011, and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Islamic Muslim Brotherhood continue to fight the military backed government for political control in the country.

Like the anti-homosexuality laws of <a href="/hotline/2012/12/paul-johnson-manx-homosexuality.php">Isle of Man</a> and <a href="/hotline/2012/11/paul-johnson-guernsey-homosexuality.php">Guernsey</a> [JURIST op-eds], Northern Cyprus's law criminalizing homosexual relations was a holdover from British colonial rule, although the island became independent in 1960. In 1974, the island split between its Turkish and Greek parts; Greek Cypriots decriminalized homosexual acts in response to pressure from the EU in the 1990s. Turkish Cypriot President Dervis Eroglu has 15 days to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/27/us-cyprus-north-gay-idUSBREA0Q16R20140127">sign the bill into law</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Although Northern Cyprus was the final European state to decriminalize homosexual acts, a number of African countries have recently introduced or adopted legislation criminalizing homosexual conduct. Last week the president of Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigerian-president-signs-anti-gay-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill banning same-sex marriages and criminalizing homosexual associations, meetings and societies by subjecting them to punishment of up to fourteen years in prison. In December, Uganda's Parliament <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">passed a similar anti-homosexuality bill</a> [JURIST report] in December that, if signed by President Yoweri Museveni, would impose harsher sentences for "aggravated homosexuality", already a crime under Ugandan law. Homosexuality is <a href="http://www.globalequality.org/component/content/article/166">illegal in 37 African countries</a> [CGE backgrounder], and South Africa is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18118350">only country on the continent</a> [BBC report] where same-sex marriage is not prohibited.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Louise O'Keeffe brought the case to the European rights court after the Ireland high court ruled the government was not legally liable for her abuse. The ECHR found the state of Ireland violated two articles of the  <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], Article 3 and Article 13. The Article 3 violation concerns the state's failure to protect O'Keeffe from sexual abuse and the Article 13 violation concerns her inability to obtain an effective remedy on the national level for that failure. The ECHR found that "it was an inherent obligation of a Government to protect children from ill-treatment, especially in a primary education context." The court acknowledged a failure by the state based on the fact that over 400 incidents of abuse have been reported in O'Keeffe's primary school in County Cork since the 1960s. The former principal responsible for the abuse was ordered to pay damages to his victims and sentenced to a three year jail term in 1998. The ECHR judgment is <a href="http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/landmark-victory-after-30-years-for-abuse-victim-louise-okeeffe-29957162.html">expected to raise</a> [<em>Irish Independent</em> report] the number of claims brought by victims of abuse against state employees in Ireland.

<p>The right of children to be protected from abuse is a significant issue in Ireland and around the world. Earlier in January the UN Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the Child <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-committee-criticizes-vatican-over-child-sex-abuse.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Vatican for its handling of child sex abuse. In December a US judge in the highest court of Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/pa-court-overturns-priests-conviction-in-sex-abuse-cover-up.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of a priest, who was charged with endangering the welfare of children because he failed to protect children from a sexual predator. In November a UN independent rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/benin-government-must-better-protect-children-un-rights-expert.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the Benin government to better protect the rights of children after a visit to the country reportedly revealed widespread abuse and exploitation.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 4-3 ruling, the Supreme Court determined that the ballot initiative met the requirements of the Florida Constitution, that it encompassed only one issue, and that the title and summary accurately reflect the substance of the proposed amendment. "Today's ruling leaves the issues of medical marijuana in the hands of Florida voters," said Florida <a href="http://www.pambondi.com/Pam_Bondi/welcome.html">Attorney General Pam Bondi</a> [official website], who opposed the initiative and petitioned the court to review it. The initiative is scheduled to go before voters in November.

The motion alleges that Judge Bernard McGinley of the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/commonwealth-court/">Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court</a> [official website] made repeated mistakes of statutory construction and constitutional analysis. It alleges that he improperly declared the statute facially unconstitutional due to the way it was implemented, rather than the text of the statute itself being unconstitutional, stating, "The statute cannot be declared facially unconstitutional based solely on flaws found in the executive's reading or administration of the statute." Lawyers for the plaintiff in the case have reportedly <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/pa-gov-asks-court-reverse-decision-voter-id-22258202">stated</a> [AP report] that the arguments alleged in the motion are largely identical to those raised previously by Corbett's lawyers at trial, and that McGinley had properly analyzed the statute in finding it unconstitutional. The next step in the process will be for plaintiff's lawyers to file their response to this motion. 

<p>McGinley <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pennsylvania-judge-strikes-down-voter-id-law.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] his opinion holding the law unconstitutional on January 17, saying that it did not further the goals of free and fair elections. The law has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pennsylvania-court-renews-injunction-on-voter-id-law.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] repeatedly since its passing, most recently in August for the then-upcoming November election. The case has previously been argued all the way up to the state Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 that the lower court had improperly upheld the law and remanded the case. Currently 32 states <a href="/feature/2013/07/voter-id-laws.php">have</a> [JURIST backgrounder] some form of voter ID law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Pirate Bay is an open source torrent search website that can provide users access to copyrighted material. The court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/dutch-appeals-court-lifts-block-pirate-bay-22261794">found</a> [AP report] that the ban had been nearly impossible to enforce, with many users bypassing the ban by accessing the site through identical clone-sites or using "open proxy" servers. The ruling reportedly stated that the ban imposed a violation of the basic right of free commercial activity, and lacked adequate justification. The court also noticed the significance of the fact that the ones against whom the ban was being enforced&#8212;the Internet providers&#8212;were not themselves violating any copyrights. The proponents of the ban have claimed that it is a necessary measure to protect the online legal marketplace from illegal competition. 

<p>The Pirate Bay has been the target of many attempts at enforcing internet copyright infringement laws. In September a Swedish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sweden-court-reduces-sentence-of-pirate-bay-founder.php">reduced</a> the prison sentence of Gottfrid Svartholm Warg, founder of the site, after he was originally <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/sweden-court-convicts-founder-of-pirate-bay-website.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison in June. Also in June Ireland's Dublin High Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ireland-court-orders-isps-to-block-pirate-bay-file-sharing-site.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a ruling ordering several Irish Internet providers to block access to The Pirate Bay. In March the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/europe-rights-court-upholds-pirate-bay-co-founders-criminal-conviction.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of two of the other Prate Bay founders for their roles in aiding copyright infringement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICTY had <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-judges-order-mladic-to-testify-at-karadzic-trial.php">granted Karadzic's motion</a> [JURIST report] in December to subpoena Mladic to testify at his trial. Karadzic has been <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf">charged</a> [ICTY case summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] with genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war. Karadzic expected Mladic to testify that in numerous conversations and meetings between them, they never agreed to commit the crimes of which Karadzic is accused, which would negate his <em>mens rea</em> for multiple charges. Mladic, however, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bosnia/10600824/Ratko-Mladic-condemns-war-crimes-tribunal-as-satanic.html">refused to answer questions</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] directed towards him at Tuesday's hearing. Mladic also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25923102">denounced the ICTY</a> [BBC report] as "satanic," and stated that testifying in Karadzic's case could prejudice his own case in the future.  

<p>Karadzic has been accused, among other things, of participating in the planning of the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/675945.stm">Srebrenica Massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">news archive</a>], which resulted in the death of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys. In October 2012 Karadzic <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/karadzic-opens-defense-before-icty.php">opened his defense</a> [JURIST report] in the ICTY by denying all charges against him. Earlier in 2012 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/icty-denies-karadzic-request-for-new-trial.php">denied</a> Karadzic's request for a new trial after he argued that the prosecution had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/karadzic-asks-icty-for-new-war-crimes-trial.php">failed to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] crucial information until after trial. The court reasoned that the delay in disclosing evidence had not infringed on Karadzic's right to a fair trial. In June 2012 the judges from the ICTY went on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/karadzic-judges-visit-srebrenica-massacre-site.php">five-day visit</a> [JURIST report] to locations relevant to the indictment of Karadzic. This visit came just months after the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/former-yugoslavia-municipal-officer-sentenced-to-2-years-for-refusing-to-testify.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former president of the municipality of Sokolac, BiH, Milan Tupajic to two months in prison for refusing to testify against Karadzic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Recent <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47022&Cr=cambodia&Cr1=#.Uug1q3co7R0">demonstrations</a> [press release] have been the combined efforts of government opposition protesting the allegedly rigged election of Prime Minister Hun Sen last year, extending a 28-year rule, as well as garment workers demanding higher wages. Currently, Cambodia's garment industry represents USD $5 billion per year in exports and supports 400,000 jobs. Following the death of four protestors earlier this month, the ILO <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/who-we-are/ilo-director-general/statements-and-speeches/WCMS_234644/lang--en/index.htm">reiterated</a> [press release] its insistence upon an independent inquiry into police action and arrests.  

<p>The political atmosphere in Cambodia has been tense since last year's elections. Earlier this month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-urges-cambodia-authorities-to-show-restraint-dealing-with-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Cambodian authorities to exercise restraint when dealing with protestors.

The order was in response to a request by a <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) prosecutor in the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/justice/prosecution.php">Kosovo Special Prosecution Office</a> (SPRK) [official websites]. Ivanovic <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/pressreleases/0547.php">voluntarily presented himself</a> [press release] at a Mitrovica police station on Monday and was arrested after a suspect interview was conducted.

<p>In response to the widespread commission of war crimes during the conflict in Kosovo, EULEX was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">created in 2008</a> [JURIST report] to assist in the effort of bringing perpetrators to justice. A EULEX prosecutor in the SPRK <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/sprk-indicts-15-for-war-crimes-at-kla-detention-center-in-1998.php">filed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] against 15 defendants in November in the EULEX Mitrovica Basic Court.  The individuals were accused of war crimes against civilians that occurred at a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) detention center in Likovac in 1998. Fatmir Limaj, an ally of <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,1">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kosovo-politician-again-acquitted-of-war-crimes-charges.php">acquitted</a> by EULEX in September for the third time after his <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/retrial-begins-against-kosovo-politician-accused-of-war-crimes.php">retrial began</a> [JURIST reports] in April.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmarriage.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://iga.in.gov/">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Tuesday approved a proposed state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. In a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/28/us-usa-gaymarriage-indiana-idUSBREA0R1Z520140128">57-40 vote</a> [Reuters report], the Indiana House moved the joint resolution, which had been on the rolls since 2004, forward into the Senate chambers. However, because the current legislature removed language banning civil unions from the original proposal, the amendment will be ineligible for a referendum vote during the state's election in November unless it is restored by the state senate. Tuesday's approval leaves the door open for a referendum vote in the 2016 election cycle. Under Indiana's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/28/indiana-house-approves-constitutional-amendment-to-ban-gay-marriages/">constitutional amendment process</a> [AP report], the same measure must be approved by two consecutive two-year sessions of the General Assembly and then be placed on the ballot for consideration by voters. Supporters of the proposal claim that having a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in addition to state statute would increase the ban's chances of surviving a court challenge. 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges before numerous state and federal courts. Last week <a href="http://www.ag.virginia.gov/About%20The%20Attorney%20General/Bio.html">Virginia Attorney Genera Mark Herring</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his office will no longer defend legal challenges to the commonwealth's ban on same-sex marriage. Days earlier six same-sex couples and the <a href="http://eqfl.org/">Equality Florida Institute</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/same-sex-couples-sue-to-overturn-florida-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit in a Florida state court seeking to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage marriage. Earlier this month US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed in the state of Utah. In November Illinois became the fifteenth US state to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/illinois-house-votes-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">legalize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage. Earlier in November, a federal judge in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-allows-ohio-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit seeking the recognition of same-sex marriages on Ohio death certificates could continue. Also in November a Colorado same-sex couple <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-couple-seeks-to-overturn-state-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a marriage license. Earlier that week a Missouri court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/missouri-supreme-court-ruling-denies-same-sex-partner-survivor-benefits.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex partner survivor benefits. In October JURIST Guest Columnist Theodore Seto argued the fallout from the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] decision is only beginning <a href="/forum/2013/10/theodore-seto-windsor-fallout.php">to show the role state governments will have</a> [JURIST op-ed] in state constitutional modification, in addition to the possibility that a same-sex marriage case will reach the US Supreme Court in the future. In September a Kentucky judge issued a ruling in the opposite direction, holding that partners in a same-sex couple <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kentucky-judge-orders-woman-to-testify-against-same-sex-spouse-in-murder-trial.php">must testify against one another</a> [JURIST report] because same-sex partners are not protected by the husband-wife privilege under state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of the amnesty proposals being considered by lawmakers would <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ukraine-lawmakers-consider-protester-amnesty">grant amnesty</a> [AP report] on the condition that protesters disband street protests and vacate buildings seized. In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, protesters have constructed a tent city in the city's major square, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianaserafin/2014/01/23/on-the-ground-in-ukraines-maidan/">Maidan</a> [Forbes backgrounder] and maintain control over three buildings including the Department of Agriculture. Opposition leader <a href="https://twitter.com/Yatsenyuk_AP">Arseniy Yatsenyuk</a> [Twitter profile] has criticized the proposal stating that protesters will not leave until conditions to amnesty are dropped. Earlier this week embattled Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Viktor+Yanukovych">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25896786">offered</a> [BBC report] the post of prime minister to Yatsenyuk, while Yatsenyuk has maintained calls for new presidential elections. 

<p>Protests began in November after the Ukrainian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] a proposed <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">trade pact</a> [EU backgrounder] with the EU.Tensions were further exacerbated when President Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/29961.html">laws</a> [materials] earlier this month that limit the right to protest government actions. Earlier this week In response to the escalating civil unrest in the country, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-pm-steps-down-parliament-repeals-anti-protest-laws.php">resigned from office</a> [JURIST report]  as Parliament repealed the harsh anti-protest laws passed earlier this month. Also in January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] and High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/senior-un-officials-call-for-dialogue-to-end-unrest-in-ukraine.php">issued statements</a> [JURIST report] urging Ukrainian protesters to use restraint and calling on both the government and protesters to work towards constructive dialogue to diffuse the rising tension and violence that has gripped the nation.

Smulls, who was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/attorney-tulsa-pharmacy-makes-mo-execution-drug-22267320">convicted</a> [AP report] and sentenced to death for killing a jewelry store owner and injuring his wife during a robbery in 1991, was scheduled to die at 12:01 AM Wednesday. Smulls' attorney filed a last minute stay of execution Tuesday, highlighting the state's refusal to disclose the name of the pharmacy that produces the lethal-injection drug, <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=4737">pentobarbital</a> [PubChem profile] to be used in the execution. According to the Associated Press, the state has argued that the pharmacy is part of the execution team and, therefore, cannot be released to the public. Missouri utilized pentobarbital to execute two inmates last year. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on Smulls' petition Wednesday.

<p>The shortage of sodium thiopental in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol. The prolonged <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of convicted murderer Dennis McGuire last week has stirred a controversy over new drugs used to administer lethal injections. Earlier this month McGuire's attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-new-execution-method-causes-suffering-death-row-inmate.php">sought a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website], claiming that the untried execution method would cause McGuire to experience a suffocation-like syndrome known as air hunger. In August a state judge in Arkansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arkansas-judge-rules-part-of-execution-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law provision allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections violates the constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. In 2011 two Texas inmates <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [USA Today report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital.</p>

<p>1/30/14 ~ Smulls was executed Wednesday after the stay was lifted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution authorizes the International Support Mission in the CAR (MISCA) and EU military personnel "to take all necessary measures," including the use of force, in maintaining security and combating the "increasing cycle of violence and retaliation" flowing from continued sectarian conflict within the CAR. According to the UN, Christian and Muslim militias continually clash, and violence often befalls civilians. Reports show the conflict has forced children to abandon their homes where they are later recruited by the armed groups. The mandate calls on CAR authorities to assist in any way in restoring order and the rule of law.       

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital in March of 2013. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also, the UN reported last week that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier this month the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR. Also in December the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to authorize the deployment of peacekeepers to CAR. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violence-in-the-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the continued violence between militias, rebels and government forces in CAR threatened to lead the country into renewed conflict. UN Sectetary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the coup by the Seleka rebels last March and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The independent expert recently traveled to Rwanda to meet with government officials and to contribute to efforts taken toward democratization, better human rights protections, and more effective implementation of international human rights standards. While Kiai noted important strides, he urged the government to better support and protect the autonomy of non-government organizations (NGOs). Rwanda law currently requires prior authorization for assemblies "in open air, on public roads or in a public space" in the interests of "public safety, tranquillity or health." Kiai asserted that the law creates an "inherent contradiction" in that it allows authorities broad discretion to prescreen and prohibit certain public assemblies. Kiai worries the law paves the way toward "arbitrary decisions," which curtail the right to freely assemble. The expert urged Rwandan authorities to eliminate authorization requirements and to recognize "spontaneous assembly" as within the ambit of the right to freely assemble. 

<p>In the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which resulted in 800,000 deaths, international and domestic entities have responded. In January a special UN event <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-world-must-respond-to-warning-signs-to-prevent-genocide.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the world must learn from the consequences of failing to respond to the events in Rwanda that preceded the genocide there 20 years ago in order to prevent such things from happening in the future. In November a French appeals court in Paris <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Claude Muhayimana and Innocent Musabyimana, two suspects wanted in connection with the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In September a court in France <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/france-court-rejects-request-to-extradite-former-rwanda-colonel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Rwanda's request for the extradition of a Hutu ex-colonel wanted in connection with the country's 1994 genocide and ordered his release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama first pledged to close the detention center five years ago, despite political opposition, and urged congress during his <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamas-2014-state-of-the-union-address-full-text/">annual State of the Union address</a> [transcript], for further action to help him do so. "With the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay," Obama said. "Because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world." The president did not say how he intends to close the internationally condemned detention center. One hundred and fifty-five prisoners remain at Guantanamo, where they have been held without trial. 

<p>The treatment of prisoners at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has raised humanitarian concerns internationally, and in recent months the US has <a href="/forum/2013/11/jeffrey-addicott-ghailani-combatant.php">grappled</a> [JURIST op-ed] with the complexities of the laws of war and the legal rights of due process for detainees. Last week, Amnesty International released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/amnesty-international-demands-closure-of-guantanamo-bay.php">demanding</a> [JURIST report] the US close Guantanamo, calling the prison's continued operation a "prime example of the USA's double standard on human rights." Also last week the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-appeals-court-denies-claim-for-damages-by-former-guantanamo-claim.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lower court was correct in dismissing the claim for damages brought by Abdul Rahim Abdul Razak Al Janko, a former Guantanamo detainee, on jurisdictional grounds. Earlier in January the panel review board (PRB) administered by the US Department of Defense (DOD) under <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/03/07/executive-order-periodic-review-individuals-detained-guant-namo-bay-nava">Executive Order 13567</a> [text] concluded its first review and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/guantanamo-panel-closes-first-review-ruling-detainee-to-be-released.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] a former Guantanamo detainee for transfer to Yemen. A week prior three Uighur Muslim detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/last-uighur-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">transferred</a> to Slovakia and in December of last year two Guantanamo detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-transfers-2-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudi-arabia.php">transferred</a> [JURIST reports] to Saudi Arabia. Also last December the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/dc-circuit-affirms-habeas-denial-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a denial of a writ of habeas corpus for a Guantanamo detainee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to rights activists in Havana, an estimated 100 pro-democracy activists have been <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/01/28/3898911/us-rights-groups-condemn-cuban.html">briefly detained</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] or put under house arrest for the two-day summit of the <a href="http://celac.cubaminrex.cu/en">Community of Latin American and Caribbean States</a> (CELAC) [official website], which ends Tuesday. Thirty dissidents were detained when they gathered in Santiago de Cuba as Cuban ruler <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12700491">Raul Castro</a> [BBC profile] was giving his opening address to the summit. CELAC is supposed work towards economic integration of its 33 member states. Dissidents were planning two "parallel summits" this week to discuss human rights and other issues. Argentine activist Gabriel Salvia was deported by Cuban authorities when he arrived in Havana to join the parallel summit. "It is unacceptable to not to be able to do in Cuba what can be done in any other country that belongs to CELAC," Salvia said on his <a href="https://twitter.com/GabrielSalvia">twitter page</a> [text, in Spanish].  

<p>Cuba has had a history of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2011/cuba">suppressing political dissent</a> [HRW backgrounder] through the holding of prisoners of conscience or criminal prosecutions. In August, AI called for Cuba <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-release-prisoners-of-conscience.php">to release five prisoners</a> [JURIST report] whom the group as called "prisoners of conscience," which AI believes is indicative of the continuing repression of speech that exists in the country. Last January various dissident groups, such as the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said that the Cuban government <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/cuba-rights-abuses-against-political-opposition-increasing-report.php">imprisoned more than 6,000 political activists</a> [JURIST report] in 2012. Last August AI called on Cuba <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-cuba-must-stop-harassing-political-activists.php">to end its harassment</a> [JURIST report] of political opposition. Last July both AI and the US government <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-amnesty-international-criticize-cuba-for-treatment-of-dissidents.php">criticized </a>[JURIST report] Cuba for how it treated political opposition.

The plaintiffs in the case, which include a group of SOCE practitioners, <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2013/09/10/12-17681_PFR.pdf">filed</a> [petition, PDF] for panel and <em>en banc</em> rehearing in September after the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/08/29/12-17681.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy-ban.php">report</a>] the law in August. The plaintiffs challenged the law on as an unconstitutional infringement on the First Amendment rights of SOCE practitioners and potential patients. However, the Ninth Circuit determined that the law regulates professional conduct rather than speech.

<p>California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the bill in October, making California the first state to pass a law banning gay conversion therapy. The bill was supported by the California Chapter of the <a href="http://www.naswca.org/">National Association of Social Workers</a>, the California Division of the <a href="http://aamftca.org/">American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy</a>, the <a href="http://www.apsa.org/">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbs.ca.gov/">California Board of Behavioral Sciences</a> [advocacy websites]. The Law was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">California State Assembly</a> [JURIST report] at the end of last August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST report] in May 2012. Advocates of the bill argue that therapies that attempt to reverse homosexuality have detrimental effects on mental health and contribute to suicide and substance abuse. Alternatively, groups such as the <a href="http://www.narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> [advocacy website] voiced their opposition to the bill, arguing that it relies on generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts have <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">highlighted the need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, protesters have constructed a tent city in the city's major square, the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianaserafin/2014/01/23/on-the-ground-in-ukraines-maidan/">Maidan</a> [Forbes backgrounder], and maintain control over three buildings, including the Department of Agriculture building. Opposition leader <a href="https://twitter.com/Yatsenyuk_AP">Arseniy Yatsenyuk</a> [Twitter profile] has criticized the law, stating that protesters will not leave until conditions to amnesty are dropped. Earlier this week embattled Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Viktor+Yanukovych">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25896786">offered</a> [BBC report] the post of prime minister to Yatsenyuk, while Yatsenyuk has maintained calls for new presidential elections.

<p>Protests began in November after the Ukrainian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] a proposed <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">trade pact</a> [EU backgrounder] with the EU.Tensions were further exacerbated when President Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/29961.html">laws</a> [materials] earlier this month, which limited the right to protest government actions. Also in January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] and High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/senior-un-officials-call-for-dialogue-to-end-unrest-in-ukraine.php">issued statements</a> [JURIST report] urging Ukrainian protesters to use restraint and calling on both the government and protesters to work towards constructive dialogue to diffuse the rising tension and violence that has gripped the nation. Earlier this week, in response to the escalating civil unrest in the country, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-pm-steps-down-parliament-repeals-anti-protest-laws.php">resigned from office</a> [JURIST report] as the parliament repealed the harsh anti-protest laws passed earlier this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All of the defendants were charged with possessing documents and records promoting the Brotherhood and operating communications equipment without a permit. If convicted, each defendant could receive several years in prison.

AI called the decision a victory for accountability and stated that the court had set an example for European countries and the US by recognizing that victims have a right to a thorough investigation. The rights group urged the Lithuanian government to open a full investigation into al-Hawsawi's claims. The court ruled that al-Hawsawi's claims involved violations under the <a href="http://www3.lrs.lt/home/Konstitucija/Constitution.htm">Lithuanian Constitution</a> [text] and international agreements and added that the Lithuanian <a href="http://www.prokuraturos.lt/?tabid=108">Prosecutor General's</a> [official website] prior refusal to investigate had been groundless. Al-Hawawsi was apprehended in 2003 and handed over to US custody and claims that between 2004 and 2006, he was illegally transferred to Lithuania and tortured in a secret CIA rendition facility. Al-Hawsawi is currently held in <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and faces <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] for his alleged role as a financier of the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US.

<p>Last September <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/">Amnesty International UK</a> [advocacy website] urged Lithuania to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/activists-urge-lithuania-to-re-open-secret-detention-investigations.php">reopen its investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the country's involvement in the US-led rendition and secret detention programs after a victim came forward with new information. AI had previously urged Lithuania to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/amnesty-urges-lithuania-to-reopen-investigation-into-secret-cia-prisons.php">reopen its investigation</a> [JURIST report] into secret CIA prisons in 2011. In January 2011 human rights groups also pressed for Lithuania's investigation to be reopened, calling the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urge-lithuania-to-reopen-cia-prison-investigation.php">decision to stop the investigation premature</a> [JURIST report]. Lithuanian Lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/lithuania-lawmakers-demand.php">demanded the investigation</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after ABC News reported that former CIA officials said that Lithuania provided the CIA with facilities for a secret prison for high-value <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] suspects in order to improve relations with the US. The parliamentary committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department provided the CIA with two secret facilities, but it was unclear whether either facility was used to interrogate detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Muhtorov, a 35-year-old Uzbekistan refugee was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/23/jamshid-muhtorov-arrested_n_1223993.html">arrested</a> [AP report] in January 2012 and has been indicted on charges of providing and attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4582">Islamic Jihad Union</a> [UMD START backgrounder]. Muhtorov was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/terror-suspect-challenges-nsa-surveillance-program/2014/01/29/fd077610-8951-11e3-a760-a86415d0944d_story.html">notified</a> [AP report] by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] in October that the government intended to offer into evidence during the proceedings information obtained from surveillance conducted under the FAA. The motion challenges the FAA surveillance "on the grounds that the government's monitoring of his communications under the statute violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> to the US Constitution as well as <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [texts]." As declared in the motion:<blockquote>The FAA violates the Fourth Amendment because it authorizes surveillance that violates the warrant clause and, independently, because it authorizes surveillance that is unreasonable. The statute also violates Article III by requiring judges to issue advisory opinions in the absence of a case or controversy. The procedural deficiencies of the FAA render the statute unconstitutional, and they render the surveillance of Mr. Muhtorov unconstitutional as well.</blockquote>The motion also moves for discovery of materials that would allow Muhtorov to challenge the specific manner the FAA was used in his case.

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week the <a href="http://www.pclob.gov/">Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board</a> (PCLOB) [official website], an independent agency created by Congress to protect American privacy under anti-terrorism laws, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-privacy-board-finds-nsa-phone-program-illegal.php">issued a report</a> calling the NSA's  metadata program illegal and saying that it should be ended. Earlier this month US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-pledges-an-end-to-nsas-mass-collection-practices.php">announced detailed plans</a> [JURIST report] to change surveilance policy, curbing the abilities of intelligence agencies to collect and use American phone data. Also this month the DOJ filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/gathering-phone-records-unlawful.php">appeal</a> to a federal district court ruling that held that the NSA program is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">likely unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. In September the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a previously <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/791759/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">classified opinion</a> [text, PDF] explaining why an NSA program to keep records of Americans' phone calls is constitutional. Also in September the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration  to curb the FBI's surveillance powers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, the 14 included former deputy interior minister, Lutfozzaman Babar, and a former director general of the National Security Intelligence, retired Major General Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury. In 2004 the government seized ten truck loads of weapons in a raid on a state-owned jetty in the southeastern port city of Chittagong. The weapons are believed to have been bound for the Indian insurgency group the <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/states/assam/terrorist_outfits/Ulfa.htm">United Liberation Front of Asom</a>(ULFA) [SATP profile]. Paresh Barua, a leader of the UFLA was also sentenced in absentia.

<p>Bangladesh has seen a number of high profile death sentences and executions over the past two years.

In 2001 the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the state must cover a full range of reproductive health rights under its Medicaid program, including medically necessary abortion. The new regulation, which is set to go into effect on February 2, establishes criteria that purportedly restrict the ability of low-income women to access this service. Paperwork for Medicaid reimbursement requests<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/usa-alaska-abortion-idUSL2N0L407620140130"> will include two boxes</a> [Reuters report] for doctors to check. One box asks if the woman was a victim of rape or incest while the other is checked if the doctor deems the procedure medically necessary. 

<p>There has been much controversy surrounding<a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights </a>[JURIST backgrounder] in the US. In November a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/jurist-the-us-district-court-1.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law regulating abortion facilities. Also in November Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/arizona-ag-asks-us-supreme-court-to-reinstate-abortion-law.php">petitioned </a>[JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to reinstate an Arizona law and overturn the holding of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that would strip Medicaid funding from doctors and clinics that perform abortions. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-arizona-race-based-abortion-law.php">dismissed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Arizona's race based abortion laws. In May a federal court struck down the state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">20-week abortion ban</a> [JURIST report].

The report found that the demolitions are related to the violent conflict in Syria between the government and opposition forces. HRW officials found the correlation between the armed conflict and the demolitions from eyewitness testimonies, statements from government officials and the military's involvement in the demolitions. HRW believes this destruction to be in violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/195">Hague Regulations</a> [text], which forbid the unnecessary destruction of the enemy's property, and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/publications/icrc-002-0173.pdf">Geneva Conventions</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits the "extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly." HRW urges the Syrian government to halt wanton destruction of property and urges the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to refer the situation to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years, and there is mounting international pressure to find an end to the conflict. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [UN backgrounder] last week. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the current regime. UN pressure on Syria has mounted in the last month as evidence revealed signs of war crimes in the country. Last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-syria-executions-may-be-war-crimes.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian opposition groups that eyewitness reports of mass executions are violations of human rights and may amount to war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled, "They Told Us We Deserved This: Police Violence against Gay and Bisexual Men in Kyrgyzstan," found that gay and bisexual men have been subjected to abuses including physical, sexual and psychological violence, arbitrary detention and extortion under the threat of violence by police officers, despite the decriminalization of consensual sex between men in 1998. HRW stated in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/28/kyrgyzstan-police-abuse-extortion-gay-men">press release</a> [text] that they have been unable to find a single case where an offending officer was held accountable. In the press release, Anna Kirey, a researcher for HRW, called for an end to police abuse in order to ensure that gay and bisexual men are afforded adequate protection under the law. 

<p>LGBT individuals have gained increased rights globally in the last decade, but many still face discrimination and criminal punishment throughout the world. In late December human rights activists from various international organizations<a href="/paperchase/2014/01/human-rights-activists-increase-pressure-on-iran-president-to-end-persecution-of-gays.php"> called on Iranian President Hassan Rouhani</a> [JURIST report] to end the country's persecution of LGBT Iranians in a letter citing various attacks and rights violations. In September the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/first-un-ministerial-meeting-on-gay-rights-held.php">first UN ministerial meeting</a> [JURIST report] on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals was held during the General Assembly's annual high-level debate. Also in September US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-process-same-sex-visa-applications.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that the US will begin processing same-sex visa applications the same way opposite-sex visa applications are processed. Speaking at the US embassy in London, Kerry stated, "As long as a marriage has been performed in the jurisdiction that recognizes it, then that marriage is valid under US immigration laws." In June Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/putin-signs-bill-into-law-banning-homosexual-propaganda.php">signed into law</a>[JURIST report] a bill banning the promotion of "homosexual propaganda" among minors. The law also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/30/russia-putin-signs-gay-propaganda-ban-into-law/%22">imposes fines</a> [AFP report] of up to 5,000 rubles (USD $166) and creates the power to suspend legal entities for 90 days for citizens who disseminate information suggesting that homosexuality is "socially equivalent" to heterosexuality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontindiaflag.jpg" alt="Flag of India" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN rights experts on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14205&LangID=E">welcomed</a> [press release] the January 21 decision of the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=41163">commuting</a> [order, PDF] the death sentences of 13 individuals following a finding that their petitions for mercy were unreasonably delayed. The court also <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/india-high-court-commutes-15-death-sentences-to-life-in-prison.php">commuted the death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of two other individuals on the ground of mental illness. In addition, the court requires all death row prisoners receive regular medical checkups, including mental health status. The new death row standards include offering to prisoners on death row: legal aid, 14 days notice prior to execution, time to see family members before execution, and no solitary confinement for those awaiting a decision on a mercy petition. UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions Christof Heyns commented that the decision "reaffirms the value of human rights and respect for human life, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution." UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment Juan Mendez cautioned that prisons must still continue to prohibit torture, emphasizing the nature of some methods of execution may constitute torture.

<p>Application of the death penalty has remained a controversial issue around the globe. According to a 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/death-penalty-use-declines-worldwide-ai.php">study</a> [JURIST report] released by <a href="www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], although use of the death penalty has decreased worldwide since 2003, the US was one of the five countries employing the death penalty most frequently in 2012. In April the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/gashc4058.doc.htm">approved a draft resolution</a> [press release] urging all nations to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-calls-for-worldwide-death-penalty-moratorium.php">establish a moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty with a view towards abolishing its application worldwide. In March Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-restrict-use-of-death-penalty.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to restrict the use of capital punishment to comply with international human rights obligations. Also in March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-executions-in-saudi-arabia.php">condemned</a> [JURIST] the executions of seven people in Saudi Arabia as a violation of international safeguards on the use of the death penalty. The men were executed by firing squad after convictions for theft, looting and armed robbery. Last February UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reiterated his call for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-chief-calls-for-abolition-of-death-penalty.php">global support against the use of death penalty</a> [JURIST report], stressing that its application is inconsistent with the most fundamental human right principle: the right to life. A moratorium on the death penalty was first <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the UN General Assembly in 2007 and, as of December 2012, has gained the support of 111 countries, with 41 against and 34 neither supporting nor opposing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The regulations were enacted to increase the transparency of short positions held by investors in certain EU securities, reduce settlement risks, ensure member states can intervene to reduce risks arising from short selling and credit default swaps, and ensure coordination between member states and the <a href="http://www.esma.europa.eu/">European Securities Markets Authority</a> (ESMA) [official website] in exceptional situations. Following the court's <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/eus-top-court-upholds-short-selling-ban">ruling</a> [AP report], British regulators will not be able to opt out of the short selling law, giving ESMA power in instances which it sees a threat to markets or the stability of the EU financial system. The court <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/22/us-eu-court-idUKBREA0L0TO20140122">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that the ESMA's power to adopt emergency measures in combating short selling is compatible with EU law. The controversial practice of short selling refers to the sale of borrowed shares in hopes that the price will fall so they can be bought back more cheaply to turn a profit.

<p>Short selling has been the target of much criticism, particularly following the recent financial crisis. In September the ECJ advocate general Niilo Jaaskinen <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/ecj-advocate-general-argues-against-ban-on-short-selling.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] the decision by ESMA to ban short selling. Jaaskinen rejected the measure for lack of contribution to market harmonization and overreaching on the part of the EU. In 2009 the US Securities and Exchange Commission [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/sec-makes-rule-banning-naked-short.php">made permanent</a> [JURIST report] a temporary ban on the so-called "naked" short selling of stocks. In a normal short sale, a trader borrows and sells a stock, promising to buy it back at a certain price in the future, but in a "naked" short sale, the trader doesn't actually borrow the stock before selling it. In its release announcing the retention of the rule, the SEC said that allowing the practice often left traders in a position where they could not deliver the stock, which would artificially drive down its value.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the Kenyan court, Barasa did not properly demonstrate that an arrest would lead to a violation of constitutional rights and certain oppression. The journalist now has 14 days to appeal this decision. After this time, he may be arrested and extradicted to the ICC, where he would face a potential five-year sentence.

Dmytro Bulatov, a leader of the opposition groups, was released after being detained for more than a week showing visible signs of mistreatment, including wounds to his face and hands. In the statement, a spokesperson for the OHCHR renewed calls for further talks between opposition groups and <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovich</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Viktor+Yanukovych">news archive</a>] while expressing concern over the reported deaths and acts of torture against protesters. Protests, and the government's response, have intensified throughout this month as protesters continue to call for Yanukovich's resignation. So far, six protesters have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes between the government and protesters.

<p>The statement comes the day after Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">offered amnesty to protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested and agree to meet certain conditions. The amnesty bill was passed 232-11 late Wednesday night and gave protesters 15 days to comply, but has been rejected by the opposition. Protests began in November after the Ukrainian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] a proposed <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">trade pact</a> [EU backgrounder] with the EU. Tensions were further exacerbated when Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/29961.html">laws</a> [materials] earlier this month, which limited the right to protest government actions.

The new law, enacted in response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, expanded a previous ban on assault weapons and introduced a prohibition on high-capacity ammunition magazines. In his opinion, Judge Alfred Covello stated that, as the law does not completely prohibit use of all firearms, he is "reasonably certain the prohibitions do not impose a substantial burden" upon the protection guaranteed by the Second Amendment. The case was brought by group of Connecticut organizations that advocate for strong gun rights. These groups have already stated their intent to appeal the decision. Connecticut <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/site/default.asp">Attorney General George Jepsen</a> [official website] has reportedly declared that the state will continue to defend the law, stating that the measures approving the law were "entirely appropriate and lawful."

<p>Several states have enacted new gun control measures in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, many of which have also faced challenges and lawsuits from advocacy groups. Last month the US District Court for the District of Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-dismisses-connecticut-gun-control-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to the law that was brought by the Connecticut-based firearms trade association National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF). Last January New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a law aimed at restricting gun and ammunition sales, and the National Rifle Association denounced the new law and indicated at the time that it would pursue legal challenges. Connecticut's new measure was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law in April, and is considered one of the most far-reaching gun-control laws in the country. The law added over 100 new weapons to the list of banned assault firearms and creates the nation's first database of dangerous weapon offenders. A day later Maryland also <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a new firearms law, imposing stricter requirements to obtain a license for certain types of firearms. In May Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against their state's two new gun-control laws, also enacted early in 2013. Those laws also included magazine capacity limits and increased scrutiny over those purchasing firearms. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Maines had been using the girls' bathroom throughout elementary school until the family of another student complained amid acts of bullying. At this point, the school directed Maines to use a staff bathroom. Maines' family brought this action, under the anonymous name "Susan Doe", alleging this was discrimination. The Maine Supreme Court agreed: <blockquote>The sole purpose of the public-accommodations and educational-opportunities provisions of the MHRA is to ensure equal enjoyment of and access to educational opportunities and public accommodations and facilities. The public-accommodations and educational-opportunities provisions were amended in 2005 to prohibit discrimination against transgender students in schools... [The school's] later decision to ban Susan from the girls' bathroom, based not on a determination that there had been some change in Susan's status but on others' complaints about the school's well-considered decision, constituted discrimination based on Susan's sexual orientation.</blockquote> Supporters of Maines praised the decision as a crucial ruling for the state's treatment of LGBT individuals, while opponents continue to argue that a biological determination of sex is all that should be considered in bathroom choice.

<p>Rights for transgender individuals remains a contentious issue throughout the world. California's <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/california-governor-signs-law-on-transgender-public-school-students.php">transgender law</a> [JURIST report] has been <a href="/hotline/2013/12/dean-broyles-bathroom-bill.php">criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed] recently. In November opponents <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/opponents-of-california-transgender-law-petition-for-repeal.php">called for its repeal</a> [JURIST report]. That same month the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/senate-approves-employee-non-discrimination-act.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) which prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. In October the US <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-agency-decision-extends-title-vii-protection-to-transgender-workers.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a transgender woman who endured physical and verbal harassment during her employment as a federal contractor in Maryland. The US Senate <a href="http://www.help.senate.gov/">Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee</a> (HELP) [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/us-senate-committee-approves-lgbt-employment-protections.php">approved a version</a> [JURIST report] of ENDA. In May a number of human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/cameroon-authorities-urged-to-drop-charges-against-transgendered-youths.php">urged Cameroon to drop charges</a> [JURIST report] against two transgender youths who were arrested for engaging in homosexual conduct. Earlier that month Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hong-kong-high-court-rules-transgender-woman-can-marry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting a transgender woman from marrying her boyfriend was invalid under the Chinese constitution. In March Canadian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/canada-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-transgender-discrimination.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would outlaw discrimination against transgender individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Instead the court <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/pakistan-court-dismisses-musharraf-medical-request">issued</a> [AP report] an arrest warrant for the former leader, although the warrant is "bailable," meaning that Musharraf can avoid jail by paying a bail sum of 2.5 million rupees (about $20,000). The court <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/pervez-musharraf-pakistan-arrest-warrant">claimed</a> [AFP report] in its decision that it did not have the authority to remove Musharraf's name from the exit control list. Musharraf has faced numerous legal troubles since his return to the nation in 2013, but it is considered an open question whether he will ever end up in court. The most serious of the cases against Musharraf is his trial for high treason, though he has failed to appear for a single court hearing thus far. On January 2 while on his way to court, he was taken to a hospital complaining of chest pains, with many speculating the move was calculated to allow him to go abroad for medical treatment.

<p>On Thursday the Pakistan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-supreme-court-dismisses-musharraf-petition-to-review-prior-ruling.php">rejected </a> [JURIST report] a petition by Musharraf to review its 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/pakistan-supreme-court-declares.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that his declaration of a state of emergency in 2007 was unconstitutional, the basis for the charges of treason against him. On January 9 the  Islamabad Special Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf attend his January 16 hearing, after having <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-medical-report.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] a medical report on January 6 and concluding that he was fit to appear. On December 23, 2013 the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/pakistan-court-rules-treason-trial-against-musharraf-will-continue.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that the treason proceedings were illegitimate and ruled that the trial would proceed as scheduled. The trial for treason is just a portion of Musharraf's legal troubles; in November, 2013 he was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-pakistan-president-musharraf-granted-bail-in-red-mosque-killings-case.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] bail in his trial for the "Red Mosque" killings, an operation ordered by him in 2007 that resulted in at least 100 deaths. He was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges relating to those killings in October. In August 2013 Musharraf was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the 2007 assassination of Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] spokesperson Rupert Colville on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14208&LangID=E">voiced extreme concern</a> [press release] about the increasing amount of violent attacks on members of the media in Egypt. Many attacks came on Saturday when journalists were attempting to report stories on the third anniversary of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/detail.php">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Some of these journalists suffered injuries from live fire from both opponents of the government and police. On Wednesday the Egyptian Prosecutor-General <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-prosecutors-charge-20-journalists-with-terrorism-related-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 20 Al Jazeera journalists for joining or conspiring with a terrorist group and broadcasting false images. Colville said that these charges have led to increased fear among other media. He urged Egyptian authorities to release all journalists imprisoned for carrying out legitimate news reporting activities while exercising their basic human rights. Colville also called for an independent investigation of these attacks on the media. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy website] published a report last December finding Syria the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-deadliest-nations-for-journalists.php">most dangerous nation in the world for journalists</a> [JURIST report], with Egypt and Iraq just behind. Egypt saw a considerable increase in journalist deaths in part because of the sectarian and political violence. Al Jazeera took <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/al-jazeera-takes-legal-action-against-egypt-military-government.php">legal action against the Egyptian government</a> [JURIST report] in September, accusing the regime of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/pressoffice/2013/08/201382014351649291.html">detaining journalists</a> [Al Jazeera report] without charges or on politically motivated charges, raiding Al Jazeera offices, confiscating equipment and jamming transmission of broadcasts.

HRW also urged the government to establish greater accountability for cases of police misconduct. HRW found that the police have failed to adequately protect indigenous women and girls from violent attacks, specifically in Northern British Columbia. Furthermore, HRW's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/02/13/those-who-take-us-away">February 2013 report</a> [text] found that the British Columbia police were exhibiting abusive behavior against women and children, including excessive use of force, physical assault and sexual assault. HRW claims that Canada has inadequate police complaint mechanisms and oversight of police behavior procedures. In August HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/08/09/canada-violence-against-indigenous-women-demands-inquiry">demanded a similar inquiry</a> [press release] into violence against women occurring in British Columbia. In April the UN Human Rights Council <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/30/canada-safety-indigenous-women-under-un-scrutiny">voiced</a> [press release] concerns about the safety of indigenous women in Canada.  

<p>In September the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender">World Bank</a> and <a href="http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/corp_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/home">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC) [official websites] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/women-still-subject-to-legal-inequalities-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] revealing that most countries still have legal disparities that prevent women from engaging in economic activity. In the same month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-urges-yemen-to-include-womens-rights-in-constitution.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the head of the Rights and Freedoms Working Group for Yemen's National Dialogue to incorporate protections for women in the country's new constitution. HRW listed seven key issues affecting women's rights&#8212;equality, non-discrimination, political parties, violence against women, personal status law, child marriage and nationality rights. In May the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=3543&language=en-US">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-urges-libya-to-include-women-in-drafting-constitution.php">participation</a> [JURIST report] of Libyan women in the Constitution Drafting Assembly. The UNSMIL noted that the preparation and drafting of the constitution is a significant part of Libya's democratic transition, and the representation and participation of women throughout the process will greatly contribute to the growth of the country. Also in May the <a href="unama.unmissions.org">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) and <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-urges-afghanistan-to-approve-womens-rights-legislation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] Afghanistan's government to fully respect and defend the fundamental rights of women and girls by ensuring the implementation of and respect for women's rights legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 54-page ruling, New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick found that BNY Mellon, a party in the matter, did <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/31/judge-approves-bank-of-america-mortgage-settlement/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0">not abuse its discretion</a> [NYT report] when entering into the settlement agreement. American International Group (AIG), one of the country's largest insurers and an investor in the securities, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/31/ny-85b-bank-of-america-settlement/5084963/">objected to the settlement</a> [AP report] due to a lack of adequate recovery, stating that there still remains several appeals that need resolving before the settlement takes effect. 

<p>The effort to hold banking giants liable for their roles in mortgage fraud and the ensuing financial crisis has been ongoing. Last October BOA was found <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/bank-of-america-found-liable-in-mortgage-fraud-case.php">liable</a> [JURIST report] by a federal court jury for fraudulently making bad loans and for removing quality checks for those loans. JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/jpmorgan-reaches-13-billion-settlement-with-doj-reports.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a case with the DOJ days beforehand in the amount of $13 billion. The effort against BOA itself is also <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-sues-bank-of-america-for-fraud-relating-to-financial-crisis.php">ongoing</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ filed another suit in August in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina for similar fraud amounting to more than $850 million. In January of last year BOA <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/boa-reaches-10-billion-settlement-with-fannie-mae-over-faulty-lending-practices.php">settled a separate claim</a> [JURIST report] brought by Fannie Mae over its lending practices for $10 billion. BOA has elected to settle other claims as well, such as the class-action suit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bank-of-america-settles-class-action-suit-over-merrill-lynch-acquisition.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] by Merrill Lynch in 2012, with the settlement agreement amounting to $2.43 billion. In all, claims arising from BOA's role in the 2007-2008 financial crisis have already cost the corporation several billion dollars, with more claims and suits still to be adjudicated or settled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/93164/Egypt/Politics-/UPDATED-Trial-of-Egypts-deposed-Morsi-underway-.aspx">appeared</a> [Ahram report] with 14 co-defendants before the court for the alleged acts committed at the Ittihadiya Presidential Palace in December 2012. Morsi continues to reject the charges by claiming the court has no jurisdiction because he is still the lawful president of Egypt. Morsi's lawyer argues that Morsi is entitled, as the rightful president, to have the investigation led by the prosecutor-general and be tried before senior members of the appeals court and constitutional court. The case was then adjourned until Tuesday to give a committee of media members time to inspect video evidence the court declassified for the trial. 

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011, and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Islamic <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] continue to fight the military backed government for political control in the country. This trial, which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-court-adjourns-morsi-trial-until-january.php">adjourned in November</a> until now, comes just one week after Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST reports] it would elect a new president before voting on a parliament. In the last six weeks, the Egyptian government made a major step in governmental reform through the drafting of a new constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-by-98-of-voters.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] by 98 percent of voters last month. Egyptians <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-egyptian-constitution-approved-according-to-unofficial-results.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] on the new military-backed constitution on January 16, with news reports citing a 42 percent voter turnout rate coupled with serious irregularities in the voting records. Morsi's actions while in office have generated much <a href="/sidebar/2013/10/ryan-suto-morsi-murders.php">criticism</a> and his trial has prompted a great deal of <a href="/dateline/2013/09/liesel-lecates-egypt-sentences.php">scholarship</a> [JURIST op-eds].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.simonrobins.com/missing/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Nepal-TRC-Ordinance.pdf">Ordinance on Truth, Reconciliation and Disappearances</a> [text, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nepal-top-court-rejects-amnesty-legislation.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month for provisions that would have afforded amnesty to some human rights violators. The Supreme Court directed parliament to repeal the ordinance or amend the provisions, but earlier this week, parliament reintroduced it unchanged. Ben Schonveld, South Asia director with the ICJ, said the action "raises serious concerns over the government's respect for the rule of law in Nepal." The rights groups have urged the government to respect the Supreme Court's ruling and introduce new legislation in line with international human rights law.

<p>Nepal's treatment of human rights issues has been a controversial topic in the wake of the <a href="http://www.insightonconflict.org/conflicts/nepal/conflict-profile/">civil war</a> [Insight on Conflict backgrounder] that ended in 2006.

The statement comes in relation to the trial of two current heads of the Kenyan government, Kenya's president, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a>, and his deputy, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [ICC case materials]. The AU asked the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to postpone the trials while the Kenyan leaders were still in power, but the resolution failed to get the required nine votes, making it the first resolution in decades to fail without a veto from one of the permanent members. Further, the statement emphasized the need for a united AU position for the proposed amendments to <a href="http://legal.un.org/icc/apic/apic(e).pdf">Articles 16 and 27 of the Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] which governs the ICC's jurisdiction. According to reports, only Botswana is opposed to the current AU position. The amendments will be considered by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/asp/Pages/asp_home.aspx">Assembly of States Parties</a> (ASP) [official website] to the Rome Statute during upcoming sessions.

<p>The AU's position has sparked much controversy and <a href="/forum/2013/10/fred-nkusi-icc-africa.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In October <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/rights-group-criticizes-african-union-icc-declaration.php">spoke out against</a> [JURIST report] the AU's stance calling it an attempt at "political interference in independent judicial proceedings." The <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/africa-leaders-should-be-immune-from-icc-prosecution-au.php">initial declaration</a> [JURIST report] was given just days before as part of a protest against the trials of the Kenyan leaders, which have caused their own set of controversies. Kenya's National Assembly voted in September to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw from the ICC</a> [JURIST report] and is expected to take action to this end soon. Kenya's parliament began to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-debates-withdrawal-from-icc.php">formally debate</a> [JURIST report] withdrawal earlier in September. In July the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-rejects-request-to-hold-kenya-trials-in-africa.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a request by Kenyan officials to change the forum of the trials to Kenya or Tanzania. The defense request was filed in January under articles 3(3) and 62 of the Rome Statute and Rule 100 of the ICC Rules and Procedures of Evidence, which provides for in situ hearings. In May, African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Kenyatta and Ruto be tried in Kenya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"The amended proposed class ... meets the requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation," US District Judge Michael Urbanski said in his ruling. "Accordingly, the court will enter an appropriate order this day granting plaintiffs' motions and certifying the class." With class certification, the plaintiffs will now be representing all same-sex couples in Virginia, including unmarried couples and those married outside of the state. "We want to be clear that we're fighting for families across the state," said Claire Guthrie Gastanaga, executive director of the <a href="http://acluva.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia</a> [advocacy website], one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs.

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community. Numerous challenges to same-sex marriage bans have arisen before state and federal courts just in the last month.

On January 22, six same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/same-sex-couples-sue-to-overturn-florida-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Florida state court challenging that state's ban on same-sex marriage.

The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/saudi-anti-terrorism-law-worries-activists-22333259">law</a> [AP report] is composed of 41 articles, and it states that any act which undermines the state or society can be tried as an act of terrorism.

<p>Over the past year, a number of individuals have been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia for crimes of terrorism or sedition against the state. In December a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-rights-activist-to-4-years-in-prison-300-lashes.php">sentenced political activist</a> [JURIST report] Omar al-Saeed to four years in prison and 300 lashes for urging Saudi Arabia to become a constitutional monarchy. In July a Saudi court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-website-editor-to-7-years-in-prison.php">sentenced the editor of a liberal website</a> [JURIST report] to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for his role in founding an Internet forum that violates Islamic values and propagates liberal thought. In June HRW and other advocacy groups urged the EU to condemn Saudi Arabia for <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-saudi-arabia-should-be-condemned-for-convicting-7-facebook-protesters.php">convicting seven governmental critics</a> [JURIST report] of inciting protests through Facebook.

Cameraman Mohamed Badr was arrested during protests in Ramses Square in central Cairo against the army's ouster of president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morsi">news archive</a>]. Badr, who has been held since July, was accused of "carrying out acts of violence and thuggery," attempting to storm a police station and targeting police officers with "firearms and birdshots." Al Jazeera repeatedly denied the accusations. Badr's Lawyer Saaban Saeed <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/kt-article-display-1.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2014/February/middleeast_February23.xml&section=middleeast">told AFP</a> [AFP report] that Badr is no longer involved in any other case and is expected to be released by Egyptian authorities on Monday, following an order of the court. 

<p>Last week Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-prosecutors-charge-20-journalists-with-terrorism-related-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 20 Al Jazeera journalists with joining or conspiring with a terrorist group and broadcasting false images. The journalists are accused of altering video footage to portray Egypt in a state of "civil war" to assist the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>], which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Egypt-government-declares-Muslim-Brotherhood-a-terrorist-group.php">declared a terrorist group</a> [JURIST report] last December by the Egyptian government. The <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-deadliest-nations-for-journalists.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] last December finding Egypt one of the top three most dangerous nations in the world for journalists. Egypt saw a considerable increase in journalist deaths in part because of the sectarian and political violence. In September Al Jazeera <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/al-jazeera-takes-legal-action-against-egypt-military-government.php">took legal action</a> [JURIST report] against the Egyptian government, accusing the regime of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/pressoffice/2013/08/201382014351649291.html">detaining journalists</a> [Al Jazeera report] without charges or on politically motivated charges, raiding Al Jazeera offices, confiscating equipment and jamming transmission of broadcasts.

Syed Mohammad Qaisar, the former state minister for agriculture during the military rule of General HM Ershad, was arrested last May. Qaisar, 73, is <a href="http://www.sakaaltimes.com/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=5421177812794427102&SectionId=4924098573178130559&SectionName=Latest%20News&NewsDate=20140202&NewsTitle=Ex%20B%27desh%20minister%20indicted%20for%20war%20crimes">accused</a> [Sakaal Times report] of committing crimes against humanity during the war, including genocide, torture, murder and rape. A three-member panel for Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICTB) has scheduled the trial to begin on March 4. Qaisar has denied all charges. 

<p>The war crimes tribunal has led to increased unrest and clashes between protestors and security forces throughout the nation. Human rights groups say that the ICTB, which was set up in 2010 to investigate abuses committed in that war, does not meet international standards and supporters of the Islamist party <a href="http://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/en/">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> (JI) [party website; Global Security <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">backgrounder</a>] say the tribunal is being used politically to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25557101">eradicate its leaders</a> [BBC report]. Last month the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/bangladesh-islamist-leader-charged-with-crimes-during-1971-war-for-independence.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] Abdus Subhan, a leader in Bangladesh's main Islamist party, with committing war crimes.

Also in December, two UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-halt-execution.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Bangladesh government to halt the execution of Mullah, advocating that the right of appeal is particularly important in death penalty cases, separating "possibly permitted" capital punishment from summary execution, "which by definition violates human rights standards." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The first-ever EC report on the subject details the nature of corruption in each member state as well as the impact corruption has on the European economy. In a press conference on Monday, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/malmstrom/index_en.htm">Cecilia Malmstrom</a> [official website] <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-14-89_en.htm">stated</a> [press release] that four out of 10 European companies consider corruption an obstacle for doing business within the EU, a troubling figure during a time of economic and financial crisis. She went on to say that while the level of corruption varies between member states and that many states have already begun placing more focus on addressing this issue, there is still no "corruption free" zone in Europe and more needs to be done to eradicate it. 

<p>While this is the first report that the EC has published on corruption within its member states, it is not the first time the EU has addressed the issue. In January the EC released its semi-annual Cooperation and Verification Mechanism report on Romania, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-warns-romania-over-continued-corruption-judicial-concerns.php">warning the nation</a> [JURIST report] to end political pressure on the judiciary amid continuing concerns over corruption. In 2011 Croatian officials were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">put under serious pressure</a> [JURIST report] to tackle the issue of corruption within their country in order to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/index_en.htm">gain accession</a> [criteria materials] to the EU. In 2010 the EC <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bulgaria-romania-legal-systems-need.php">released reports</a> [JURIST report] stating that Bulgaria and Romania must do more to combat corruption and organized crime and conduct judicial reforms in order to enjoy their full rights as members of the EU. In 2009 a council for the EU said that Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">needed to do more</a> [JURIST report] in terms of judicial reform, protection of citizens' rights and various other efforts in order to further their request to be granted accession. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report argues that three large mining companies in particular have infringed upon the rights of the indigenous people of Karamoja by engaging in land and mineral grabs, causing environmental damage and refusing to provide information concerning the occurrence, extent and timing of their explorations. Communities in Karamoja traditionally own land communally or collectively. According to HRW, this type of ownership framework is at odds with Ugandan law. As a result, residents lack the ability to formally memorialize proof of their land ownership, which, HRW argues, puts the communities in "significant jeopardy of rights abuses" as mining activities increase. According to HRW, companies seeking to mine in Karamoja have a responsibility to respect human rights, including the land and resource rights of its indigenous peoples. In addition, HRW asserts that the government has an obligation to respect, protect and fulfill these rights, which include the rights of mining employees. One company mentioned in the report, <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=1238982">East African Mining LTD</a> [Bloomberg backgrounder], <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/A%20Statement%20on%20Behalf%20of%20East%20African%20Mining%20Ltd.pdf">disputes HRW's claims</a> [press release].

<p>Disputes between mining companies and local communities are a global occurrence. In June Amnesty International (AI) claimed that Chinese-owned mining companies in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ai-china-mining-companies-contributing-to-congo-rights-abuses.php">contributed to a culture of human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report]. AI specifically claimed those companies should be held accountable for longstanding, ongoing human rights abuses related to child labor, on-site injuries, financial exploitation and illegal detainment of workers in handmade jail cells. In January 2013 HRW reported that investing in Eritrea's mines without assurance of fair labor practices could lead to allegations of <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-eritrea-mine-investors-risk-complicity-in-human-rights-violations.php">complicity in human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2012 the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples James Anaya <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-expert-urges-panama-to-end-clashes-with-indigenous-peoples.php">urged the Panamanian government</a> [JURIST report] to open a dialogue with the country's indigenous peoples in an effort to alleviate tension and reduce violence. The request came after one indigenous group occupied portions of the Pan-American Highway in protest of mining and drilling activities taking place on their lands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to AHRC, more than 1,000 undocumented immigrant children are currently detained behind "wire and steel fences" at closed detention facilities throughout Australia. In 2004, AHRC conducted a similar inquiry and concluded that such detention was "fundamentally inconsistent" with Australia's international human rights obligations and that detention for long periods created a "high risk of serious mental harm." In light of "significant improvements" in government policy resulting from the first inquiry, AHRC now seeks to investigate what, if any, changes have occurred for children within the nation's immigration detention facilities. According to AHRC President Gillian Triggs:<blockquote>These children who are living and have lived in immigration detention need to be given a voice. Their stories need to be told. Their rights need to be addressed. We need to understand the long-term effects on children of living in such circumstances. And we need to encourage government to respond, once again, with humanity. It is my hope that the eventual findings of this new Inquiry will achieve this outcome.</blockquote>Triggs hopes the inquiry will align the nation's immigration detention practices with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which declares "the best interests of the child" a primary consideration in "all actions regarding children."

<p>Immigration continues to be a serious issue in Australia. In November 2009 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/australia-pm-issues-apology-to-migrant.php">issued an apology</a> [JURIST report] to poor and underprivileged British children who were sent to Australia and other former British colonies over the last century with the supposed intention of giving them a better life, but were instead subjected to childhood of abuse and hard labor. In July 2005 Australia <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/australia-softens-controversial.php">abandoned mandatory detention</a> [JURIST report] for some undocumented immigrants, one of the most criticized provisions of its immigration law, releasing dozens of children. Australia's courts also paved the way for more than 1,000 asylum-seekers to avoid deportation. In June 2005 Australian Prime Minister John Howard <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/australia-eases-mandatory-detention.php">loosened rules for mandatory detention of immigrants</a> [JURIST report] who enter the country without visas to head off a revolt among members of his government over what are increasingly seen as unduly-harsh immigration laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Minister Olena Lukash <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/02/03/world/europe/ap-eu-ukraine-protests.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0">stated</a> [AP report] last week that officials were preparing methods of constitutional change but did not elaborate on what those methods were. The protesters have also demanded Yanukovych's resignation and early elections, though the president has shown no signs of accepting these conditions. The Russian foreign ministry <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26019790">denounced</a> [BBC report] the actions of the protesters, who want closer ties to the EU, and urged opposition leaders to increase negotiations with the government. Yanukovych moved away from EU negotiations for fear that the country would suffer from losing trade with Russia, who wants Ukraine to be a part of a Moscow-led trade alliance.

<p>The protests in Ukraine's capital have continued for more than two months, prompting reactions from both international and local government officials. In January the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters. The statement came the day after Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">offered amnesty to protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested and agree to meet certain conditions. The amnesty bill was passed 232-11 and gave protesters 15 days to comply, but has been rejected by the opposition. Protests began in November after the Ukrainian government <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/--dnp-2.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] a proposed <a href="http://eeas.europa.eu/top_stories/2012/140912_ukraine_en.htm">trade pact</a> [EU backgrounder] with the EU. Tensions were further exacerbated when Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-president-signs-controversial-anti-protest-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a series of <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/29961.html">laws</a> [materials] earlier that month that limited the right to protest government actions. Also in January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] and the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/senior-un-officials-call-for-dialogue-to-end-unrest-in-ukraine.php">issued statements</a> [JURIST report] urging Ukrainian protesters to use restraint and calling on both the government and protesters to work towards constructive dialogue to diffuse the rising tension and violence that has gripped the nation. Earlier in January, in response to the escalating civil unrest in the country, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-pm-steps-down-parliament-repeals-anti-protest-laws.php">resigned from office</a> [JURIST report] as the parliament repealed the harsh anti-protest laws passed earlier this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article XIII, Section 13 of the <a href="http://docs.legis.wi.gov/constitution/wi/XIII/13">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [text] defines marriage as between one man and one woman and bars recognition of same-sex marriages that occur in other jurisdictions. Additionally, Wisconsin's <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/765/30">marriage evasion law</a> [text] makes it a criminal offense to leave the state and enter a marriage contract that is prohibited under Wisconsin law. The lawsuit was filed on behalf <a href="https://aclu-wi.org/story/meet-couples-our-marriage-lawsuit">four same-sex couples</a> [ACLU profiles] in order to have the state of Wisconsin permit marriage for same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages that occur in other jurisdictions. The ACLU argues that Wisconsin's marriage laws violate the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the US Constitution and run counter to the US Supreme Court holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report].

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community. Numerous challenges to same-sex marriage bans have arisen before state and federal courts in recent months. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-same-sex-marriage-suit-granted-class-action-status.php">certified a class action</a> [JURIST report] lawsuit challenging Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage. Last month Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he would not defend legal challenges to Virginia's same-sex marriage ban, which he believes is unconstitutional. Earlier in January six same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/same-sex-couples-sue-to-overturn-florida-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Florida state court challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. That same day, the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-challenges-utahs-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">ACLU challenged</a> [JURIST report] Utah's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages performed after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's same-sex marriage ban. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, Cambodia's garment industry represents USD $5 billion per year in exports and supports 400,000 jobs. Factory owners and managers reportedly use tactics such as threats, firing and temporary employment contracts to keep their employees from forming labor unions. HRW argues that the garment factories' anti-union behavior acts in violation of the freedom of association, guaranteed in the country's <a href="http://www.constitution.org/cons/cambodia.htm">constitution</a>, a well as <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">international agreements</a> [texts]. The advocacy organization urged the Cambodian government to turn its attention to upholding labor laws rather than focusing energy on quieting protesters. International clothing brands have also stressed the right for unionization in an <a href="http://www.industriall-union.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Cambodia/joint_letter_from_global_unions_and_global_brands_to_the_cambodian_prime_minister.pdf">open letter</a> [text] to Prime Minister Hun Sen.

<p>The political atmosphere in Cambodia has been tense since last year's elections. In January the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] called for cooperation amongst all parties involved in escalating violence in Cambodia, demanding a release of detained union strikers and a <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-calls-for-calm-amidst-anti-government-riots-in-cambodia.php">government probe into anti-protest police tactics</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-urges-cambodia-authorities-to-show-restraint-dealing-with-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Cambodian authorities to exercise restraint when dealing with protestors. Days beforehand, Cambodia <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/5/cambodia-cracks-downonprotestswithbanonassembly.html">banned rallies and marches</a> [Al Jazeera report] in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, and authorities <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25603225">removed more than 1,000 anti-government protesters</a> [BBC report] from the capital the same day. Phnom Penh's governor Pa Socheatvong further stated that until "public order is restored to normal," the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hZs4SNyn_r5l_wvuBHSq0Gg33PhQ?docId=72568d86-d205-485c-908a-bac1c62ae97f">not be permitted to hold demonstrations</a> [AFP report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011 and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood continue to fight the military backed government for political control of the country.

The news service requested this figure under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text, PDF], but the Obama administration argues that this information is classified under <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-classified-national-security-information">Executive Order 13526</a> [text], as it pertains to intelligence activity. The government urges that the protection and safety of Guantanamo information is crucial, outweighing the "sleight public interest" that might be gained from learning how much was spend in the construction of the structure. 

<p>The treatment of prisoners at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has raised humanitarian concerns internationally, and in recent months the US has <a href="/forum/2013/11/jeffrey-addicott-ghailani-combatant.php">grappled</a> [JURIST op-ed] with the complexities of the laws of war and the legal rights of due process for detainees. Last week, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-urges-closure-of-guantanamo-this-year.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that 2014 should be the year to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as the US shifts away from a "permanent war footing." Earlier in January, Amnesty International released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/amnesty-international-demands-closure-of-guantanamo-bay.php">demanding</a> [JURIST report] the US close Guantanamo, calling the prison's continued operation a "prime example of the USA's double standard on human rights." Also in January, the panel review board (PRB) administered by the DOD under <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/amnesty-international-demands-closure-of-guantanamo-bay.php">Executive Order 13567</a> [text] concluded its first review and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/guantanamo-panel-closes-first-review-ruling-detainee-to-be-released.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] a former Guantanamo detainee for transfer to Yemen. A week prior three Uighur Muslim detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/last-uighur-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">transferred</a> to Slovakia and in December of last year two Guantanamo detainees were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/us-transfers-2-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudi-arabia.php">transferred</a> [JURIST reports] to Saudi Arabia.

Thousands of civilian cases have been referred to military courts since early 2011, when the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began. The practice has faced opposition from human rights advocates, and the military tribunals have particularly faced criticism for recently passing verdicts against Egyptian journalists.

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the Egyptian Revolution, and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Islamic <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] continue to fight the military backed government for political control in the country.

Last week, Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-prosecutors-charge-20-journalists-with-terrorism-related-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 20 Al Jazeera journalists with joining or conspiring with a terrorist group and broadcasting false images. Also last week, Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST reports] it would elect a new president before voting on a parliament. In the last six weeks, the Egyptian government made a major step in governmental reform through the drafting of a new constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-by-98-of-voters.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] by 98 percent of voters last month.

Detroit claims the pension debt <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-01-31/news/sns-rt-us-usa-detroit-bankruptcy-pensions-20140131_1_merrill-lynch-capital-services-steven-rhodes-kevyn-orr">violated the borrowing limits</a> [Reuters report] imposed on the city by the state of <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/">Michigan</a> [official website] and asked the judge to declare that the city has no further obligations to make payments on the pension certificates of participation (COPs). However, a court ruling for the city might also invalidate the interest-rate swap contracts Detroit had with investment banks <a href="http://www.ubs.com/us/en.html">UBS</a> and <a href="http://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/our-story/who-we-are.html#fbid=PI_8G88Asxr">Bank of America</a> [corporate websites], since the swaps were countering the interest-rate risks on the COPs. The lawsuit could render all claims based on any COPs-related contract unenforceable and void. The swap deals were valued at $400 million in 2011 and served as a primary reason Detroit filed bankruptcy.

<p>Detroit's bankruptcy matter has been working its way through the court system since the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July of last year. A judge for the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in January <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/detroit-bankruptcy-165-million-settlement-struck-down.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a proposed $165 million settlement agreement for the city of Detroit to pay off UBS and Bank of America. In December Judge Rhodes ordered the city to renegotiate its bankruptcy-related financing with UBS and Bank of America, serving as the impetus for this week's proposed settlement between the parties. Earlier in December Rhodes ruled that Detroit is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-court-rules-detroit-eligible-for-bankruptcy.php">eligible and authorized</a> [JURIST report] to file for bankruptcy, declaring the city insolvent because it owes approximately $18 billion to more than 100,000 creditors, which is harming the city's residents and making it essentially impossible for the city to negotiate with creditors. In July Rhodes <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-clears-way-for-detroit-bankruptcy-case.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] Detroit's bankruptcy filing to continue, declaring that his federal bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. This action placed a stay on a Michigan circuit court ruling that had been announced three days earlier, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/michigan-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional.php">declared the filing unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because it threatened public pension benefits and those benefits are protected by the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/constitution.pdf">Michigan Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Earlier this fall JURIST guest columnists Patrick Brady and Igor Shleypak discussed how Detroit's pension plan holders have been <a href="/dateline/2013/09/patrick-brady-detroit-bankruptcy.php">fighting for their rights</a> and explored the <a href="/dateline/2013/08/igor-shleypak-detroit-bankruptcy.php">broader consequences</a> [JURIST op-eds] that Detroit's actions may have on other cities that consider filing for protection under Chapter 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During her week-long visit to Seychelles, Ezeilo <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14214&LangID=E">noted</a> [press release] that Seychelles has taken numerous steps towards addressing the issue of human trafficking, including the ratification of numerous international conventions aimed at the prevention and punishment of trafficking, and the creation of the National Anti-Trafficking Committee. In spite of these advances, Ezeilo <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47071&Cr=trafficking&Cr1=#.UvCgUfldXTo">expressed concern</a> [press release] regarding Seychelles' lack of legal framework for the prevention and prosecution of human trafficking, particularly the fact human trafficking has not yet been criminalized in Seychelles, nor has the government taken measures in trafficking-prone industries to discourage it. Ezeilo will present a detailed report on her findings in June.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/human-trafficking/">Human trafficking</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is an international issue plaguing countries all over the world.

"This disturbing new law confirms our worst fears," said Said Boumedouha, AI's Middle East and North Africa Program Deputy Director. The <a href="http://www.uqn.gov.sa/Decisions/DecisionsCouncilMinisters/Details/PDF/1390982265740051200.pdf">Law for the Crimes of Terrorism and its Financing</a> [text, PDF, in Arabic], which went into effect February 1, has been condemned by the advocacy group for its vague definitions of terrorism, including "disturbing the public order of the state" and "harming the reputation of the state or its standing." These broad definitions, as well as the lack of judicial oversight on the Ministry of Interior's search and seizure powers, AI claims are indicative of authorities' intentions to use the law to crack down on peaceful dissent.

<p>The Saudi antiterrorism bill has drawn controversy from human rights groups since it was introduced in 2011. King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/saudi-arabia-king-ratifies-counterterrorism-law.php">ratified the bill</a> [JURIST report] on Sunday, making it law after it had been passed by the Council of Ministers in December. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-saudi-arabia-should-reject-proposed-terrorism-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the king to reject the bill in December, saying that it abridges seven fundamental human rights. In August 2011, the Shura Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/saudi-arabia-amends-highly-criticized-anti-terrorism-law.php">proposed amendments</a> [JURIST report] to the bill to bring it in line with international human rights standards. AI cited the failure to follow through on these amendments as evidence of the government's intent to use the law as a tool against dissenters. AI first <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-law-would-thwart-political-dissent-ai.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the legislation in a July 2011 press release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Simbikangwa, 54, is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/04/us-france-rwanda-trial-idUSBREA130VC20140204">charged</a> [Reuters report] with arming and directing Hutu extremists in the violence that claimed the lives of an estimated half a million ethnic Tutsi. He was arrested in 2008 while in hiding on the French island of Mayotte. A paraplegic since 1986, Simbikangwa faces a potential life sentence for complicity in the genocide and crimes against humanity. The current president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, has accused France of supporting the Hutu militia and harboring fugitives who fled to France in the years following the genocide. This trial is seen as an important first step in repairing relations between the embittered nations.

<p>France has only recently joined the US and other European nations in trying and extraditing individuals found to have aided or been complicit in the Rwanda Genocide. A French appeals court in November <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php">agreed to extradite</a> [JURIST report] two genocide suspects, one of whom had been a French citizen since 2010. In September a French court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/france-court-rejects-request-to-extradite-former-rwanda-colonel.php">refused to extradite</a> [JURIST report] an Hutu ex-colonel, citing the statute of limitations preventing extradition for crimes committed more than 10 years ago. In April French law enforcement <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a former Rwanda leader in the same week that Simbikangwa was ordered to stand trial. Rwanda genocide suspects have also been arrested in 2013 in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-hampshire-woman-sentenced-to-10-years-for-role-in-rwandan-genocide.php">New Hampshire</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/dutch-court-convicts-woman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda.php">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">Norway</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 26 of the proposed criminal procedure law prohibits authorities from speaking with relatives of criminal defendants. In the case of domestic abuse, HRW claims it may be more difficult for women to seek justice if the law goes into effect. The law is expected to reach Karzai for signature in the next two weeks.

<p>Afghanistan has been the target of much <a href="/hotline/2009/08/afghanistans-shia-personal-status-law.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] regarding human rights issues, including women's rights. The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=12254&ctl=Details&mid=15756&ItemID=37526&language=en-US">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-afghanistan-government-reponse-to-violence-against-women-inadequate-despite-increased-reporting--.php">study</a> [JURIST report] in December that raised concern over the treatment of women in the country. The report states there was an increase of reported acts of violence against women to the Afghan authorities in the past year, but prosecutions and convictions under the landmark <a href="http://www.laoa.af/laws/law_on_eliminaton_of_violence_against_women.pdf">Elimination of Violence against Women </a>(EVAW) [text, PDF] law remained low and most cases were settled through mediation. Reported incidents of forced marriage, domestic violence, and rape all increased by 28 percent, but the indictments under EVAW only increased by 2 percent. In November the HRW reported the Afghanistan Justice Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/hrw-afghanistan-penal-code-working-group-proposes-stoning-for-adultery.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] new provisions to the nation's penal code that allow for stoning as punishment for adultery.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ilhFNG0qR4pASDqyqq2ClhYHSE1w?docId=8d1478fb-4ebb-4523-aacd-3ed1d1d32826">seeks</a> [AFP report] the dissolution of the ruling party of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile] and to ban party executives from holding political office for five years. Yingluck called Sunday's elections an attempt to diffuse some of the nation's political tension, but the opposition urged a boycott of the vote. The petition alleges the elections were unconstitutional on several grounds, primarily because they were not completed in one day. Critics of the opposition have <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/4/thailand-oppositionpetitionscourttoannulelection.html">dismissed</a> [Al Jazeera report] the argument as circular, claiming that the delays causing the polls not to be completed in a single day were a result of the opposition's protest efforts, not by fault of the government. The opposition <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-03/thai-opposition-to-petition-court-to-annul-weekend-vote.html">demands</a> [Bloomberg report] that Yingluck step down, referring to her as a "puppet" of her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a 2006 coup. Other demands include the imposition of an unelected "People's Council" to enact reforms before new elections. So far Yingluck has refused to step down, saying that she was elected by a large majority and that the council suggested by the opposition would be undemocratic.

<p>Thailand has been fraught with political instability since the 2006 <a href="/forum/2006/09/disillusioned-with-democracy-tale-of.php">military coup</a>, [JURIST op-ed]. On January 26, leading up to Sunday's elections an anti-government protest leader was shot and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] during demonstrations blocking a voting station. The shooting came just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency, granting it broad powers to curtail the political unrest, including the ability to censor media, impose a curfew and detain suspects without charges. These powers are in addition to those granted in November 2013 when the prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-prime-minister-invokes-special-security-law-amidst-protests.php">invoked</a> [JURIST report] a special security law known as the Internal Security Act, which conferred broader powers on police forces attempting to contain the protests. Just days later protesters <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-protesters-seek-help-overthrowing-government.php?edition=full">stormed</a> [JURIST report] the army's headquarters in Bangkok, seeking assistance in overthrowing the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sepulvado was charged with the murder of his six-year-old stepson in 1993. Last week, Louisiana Department of Corrections officials expanded their execution protocol to include a two-drug mixture of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. Defense attorneys for Sepulvado argued a delay is justified in order to review the new drug combination, which was adopted too close to the scheduled execution date. Accordingly, Judge James Brady scheduled a trial for April 7 to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/04/us-usa-execution-louisiana-idUSBREA1305G20140204">review the constitutionality</a> [Reuters report] of the new execution protocol in Louisiana, and Sepulvado's execution is delayed until May 4. 

<p>In the US there is a shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols and resulting in a number of lawsuits challenging the use of untested drug combinations. Last week the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain and his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order contained no reasoning, stating only that a 90-day hold would be put into affect to allow a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari</em> to the US Supreme Court, and will be continued if the writ is granted. The law was challenged on First Amendment grounds, alleging that since the procedures being banned were "talk therapy," the law infringed on free speech rights. In its initial <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/08/29/12-17681.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] upholding the law the court rejected that argument, stating that it regulates conduct, not speech. Supporters of the law and several psychological associations <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-therapy-ban-20140203,0,5833854.story#axzz2sNPcRtpa">claim</a> [LAT report] that the law is a necessary measure to protect LGBT minors, since attempts to change sexuality are often futile and can be potentially psychologically harmful.

<p>California was the first state to <a href="/hotline/2013/02/ted-lieu-ca-reparative-therapy.php">ban</a> [JURIST op-ed] sexual-orientation "conversion therapy" for minors. Critics of the <a href="/dateline/2012/10/gabriel-rodriguez-rico-coversion-therapy.php">therapy</a> [JURIST op-ed] argue that it is not only ineffective, but can be severely damaging, leading to depression and even suicide in some cases. The current stay on the ruling to allow petition to the Supreme Court comes just six days after the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-rehear-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy-case.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to re-hear the case. The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the law in a decision in August. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law in October 2012 with the support of several psychological associations, advocacy and human rights groups. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Odah has based his claim on US President Barack Obama's State of the Union <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/full-text-of-obamas-2014-state-of-the-union-address/2014/01/28/e0c93358-887f-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html">address</a> [text] last week in which he stated that "by the end of the year, America's longest war will finally be over." However, officials from the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gitmo-lawsuit-20140204,0,7876888.story#axzz2sOY3X8ka">responded</a> [LAT report] by asserting that US troops are still in Afghanistan, and the completion of operations is unknown at this time. 

<p>This legal challenge is the most recent in a string of attempts by Odah to free himself from incarceration. In July 2012 a Kuwaiti lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kuwait-lawyer-sues-government-officials-for-release-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Kuwait's prime minister and other government officials in order to pressure authorities to facilitate the release of Odah and fellow inmate Faiz Kandari. Other Kuwaiti prisoners have been successful in obtaining transfer to their home country from the Guantanamo detention facility. In December 2009 the DOJ announced that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/guantanamo-detainee-transferred-to.php">detainee Fouad al Rabiah had been transferred to the Kuwaiti government</a> [JURIST report]. Al Rabiah, a Kuwaiti national, had been held at Guantanamo Bay for nearly eight years under suspicion of aiding al Qaeda and the Taliban. Two months earlier the DOJ announced that <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/guantanamo-detainee-repatriated-to.php">detainee Khaled Al-Mutairi had been transferred after his almost eight years of detention</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Mutairi, who had been accused of fighting against American troops in Afghanistan, was transferred after the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/federal-judge-orders-release-of-kuwaiti.php">ordered his release</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to AI, there are an estimated 1.5 million people in the EU who do not fully identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. 

<p>Transgender rights remain a controversial issue throughout the world.

The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47077&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.UvFXXCinUeY">killed and tortured</a> [UN News Centre report] extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children as well. Other violations against children during the country's civil war range from sexual violence and arbitrary detention to the denial of access to humanitarian aid. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] stated in the report that he urges "all parties to the conflict to take, without delay, all measures to protect and uphold the rights of all children in Syria." Ban concluded the report with a list of recommendations, calling on all parties to end ongoing and disproportionate attacks on civilian areas and immediately release women and children who have been abducted.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years, and there is mounting international pressure to find an end to the conflict. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-syria-government-responsible-for-demolitions-of-residential-areas.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] last week that Syrian authorities had deliberately demolished residential neighborhoods with explosives and bulldozers in Damascus and Hama over the last year. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the current regime. UN pressure on Syria has mounted in the last month as evidence revealed signs of war crimes in the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-syria-executions-may-be-war-crimes.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian opposition groups earlier in January that recent mass executions are in violation of international human rights, and that these acts may also constitute war crimes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The final vote in favor of the bill came after a detailed consideration of the bill by parliamentary committees. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the right to enter into civil partnerships, but this law will allow same-sex marriage ceremonies to be performed by individuals and religious entities that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25960225">affirm their desire</a> [BBC report] to perform such ceremonies. Individuals and religious entities wishing to abstain from performing same-sex marriage ceremonies are permitted to do so. The bill was originally introduced in June by <a href="http://www.alexneilmsp.net/?page=Biography">Alex Neil</a> [official profile], a member of the parliament and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing. The first same-sex marriage ceremonies are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/04/scottish-parliament-vote-legalise-gay-marriage">expected to take place</a> [<emi>Guardian</em> report] in Scotland as early as autumn of this year, after necessary remaining formalities are completed regarding the passage of the bill.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains a controversial issue among the international community. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/nigeria-anti-gay-law-draconian-un-rights-chief.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Nigeria's new law on the prohibition of same-sex marriage, calling the legislation a direct violation of basic, universal human rights. The Same Sex Marriage (Prohibition) Bill allows a 14-year prison sentence for anyone who enters into a same-sex union and a 10-year sentence for anyone who either aids and abets a same-sex marriage or supports the sustenance of "gay societies." In December Croatia's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/croatia-considers-expanding-rights-for-same-sex-couples.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would grant new rights to same-sex couples, such as the right to inherit property from each other and the right to represent each other as next of kin. Also in December the EU Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/eu-high-court-rules-same-sex-couples-entitled-to-same-benefits-as-married-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that in countries in which same-sex couples cannot legally marry, same-sex couples in a legal union are entitled to the same legal benefits as married couples. In the same month, the High Court of Australia <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/australia-high-court-overturns-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act of 2013, which allowed same-sex couples to marry within the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report calls on the Vatican to remove all priests who have, or are suspected of committed acts of child abuse, and for the Vatican to turn over all such individuals to relevant law enforcement authorities for investigation and prosecution. In addition, the Committee denounced the "code of silence" imposed on all members of the clergy under penalty of excommunication, crediting the policy for fact cases of child sexual abuse have hardly ever been reported to law enforcement authorities in the nations where the crimes occurred. In <a href="http://www.news.va/en/news/holy-see-responds-to-un-committee-on-rights-of-the">response</a> [press release] the Vatican pledged to submit the report to "thorough study and investigation, saying they:<blockquote>regret to see in some points of the Concluding Observations an attempt to interfere with Catholic Church teaching on the dignity of human person and in the exercise of religious freedom. The Holy See reiterates its commitment to defending and protecting the rights of the child, in line with the principles promoted by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and according to the moral and religious values offered by Catholic doctrine.</blockquote>The Committee also voiced concern over the Vatican's failure to take action to provide justice for girls forced to work in slavery like conditions in the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/philomena-and-irelands-magdalen-laundries/">Magdalene laundries</a> [60 Minutes report] of Ireland run by congregations of Catholic Sisters until 1996.

<p>The CRC has heavily criticized the Vatican on the its handling of child sex abuse. During questioning in Geneva in January, committee member Sara Oviedo <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-committee-criticizes-vatican-over-child-sex-abuse.php">forced Vatican officials to acknowledge</a> [JURIST report] that the Holy See had been slow to react to allegations of sexual abuse by clergy members. Former Vatican sex crimes prosecutor Monsignor Charles Scicluna, while admitting some Vatican fault, assured the committee it was committed to to take action against anyone who obstructs justice. The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/iccvaticanprosecution">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] in 2011 against Vatican officials for systematic sexual abuse and the concealment of such incidents. The complaint was filed on behalf of the <a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org/">Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests</a> (SNAP) [advocacy website] and included more than 20,000 pages of materials relating to the crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/technology/google-reaches-tentative-antitrust-settlement-with-european-union.html?hpw&rref=business&_r=0">faces</a> [NYT report] USD $5 billion in fines over accusations that the company's search engine is blocking competitors' content and promoting Google services. Under the settlement Google would guarantee that during European searches whenever Google promotes its own specialized search services on a search page the services of three rivals will also be provided "in a way that is clearly visible to users and comparable to the way in which Google displays its own services." Under the settlement Google's rivals will have to pay the company each time their results are shown alongside Google's own. Prices will be controlled by a bidding process overseen by an independent monitor In return for these concessions Google would not face any fines or be forced to admit any wrongdoing on their part. According to the European Commission, Google's compliance with this tentative requirement along with previous concessions would be supervised by an independent monitoring trustee and would be binding within the European Economic Area (EAA) for five years.

<p>Google's settlement proposal is the third such proposal from the search giant to resolve European antitrust allegations. Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/google-proposes-new-concessions-in-eu-antitrust-action.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a new settlement concession proposal in September. The company formally <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/cases/dec_docs/39740/39740_8608_5.pdf">offered concessions</a> [text, PDF] to the European Commission for a possible settlement in April, but they were rejected by EU Competition Commissioner <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/almunia/">Joaquin Almunia</a> [official profile] in July. Google has faced over legal challenges over privacy concerns. In January Britain's High Court [official website] ruled that Google <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uk-high-court-google-can-be-sued-in-the-uk.php">can be sued</a> [JURIST report] by British citizens in the UK despite Google's arguments that the case does not fall under British jurisdiction. The company is being <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-to-be-tried-in-the-uk-high-court-upholds-british-claimants-secret-tracking-case-9064826.html">sued for breach of privacy</a> [UK Independent report] by over 100 users of Apple's Safari browser who claim that Google tracked their browsing history without their knowledge, breaching the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">1998 Data Protection Act</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reports indicate that the CRC is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/un-panel-russia-should-annul-gay-propaganda-law/2014/02/05/ea2416fc-8e56-11e3-878e-d76656564a01_story.html">specifically concerned</a> [AP report] that the law's broad definitions of "propaganda" will lead to persecution of the nation's gay community, which includes younger gay rights activists. Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] endorsed the law in June. The law imposes fines of up to 5,000 rubles (USD $166) and creates the power to suspend legal entities for 90 days for citizens who disseminate information suggesting that homosexuality is "socially equivalent" to heterosexuality. 

<p>The UN has challenged the law before. Last February independent experts joined with UN Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression, human rights defense, cultural rights and the right to health to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-russia-lawmakers-to-reject-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">caution legislators</a> [JURIST report] in the Russian State Duma that the law had the potential to subvert fundamental human rights to freedom of expression by specifically targeting and restricting the activity of "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people." Experts portended that the law's broad scope would lead to judicial constructions that "unduly restrict" and stigmatize the efforts of those advocating for LGBT rights in an already "difficult environment." Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Anand Grover, specifically challenged the bill's inclusion of children in asserting that broad constructions may extend to programs promoting sexual and reproductive health among the LGBT community and may prevent children from accessing information that could help to "safeguard" mental and physical health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Following his official visit to Spain, de Greiff praised the strength of Spain's institutions. However, de Greiff emphasized the value of investigating the crimes committed during the civil war: "The State must promote greater awareness on the obligation to protect the rights that the alleged perpetrators hold, as well as the victims' rights." In that regard, de Greiff recommended the establishment of a mechanism to "officialize' the truth, "to coordinate efforts and centralize information about all the victims, regardless of the side or political affiliation of the victims or the perpetrators." Existing policies in Spain have focused on victim reparation. However, there are demands to adopt programs which include categories of victims of human rights violations that are not covered by existing programs, including the annulment of the prison sentences given by courts during the Franco era. 

<p>Justice for offenses committed during the Franco regime has been slow. In November Spanish officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/spain-officials-will-not-review-amnesty-law.php">told the UN</a> [JURIST report] that they will not reexamine the state's action during the Civil War and the Franco era. In October the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disappearances/Pages/DisappearancesIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-spain-to-provide-justice-for-disappeared.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] the Spanish government do more to provide information on the whereabouts of individuals who disappeared during the civil war and Franco regime periods. Also in October an Argentine judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/argentina-judge-seeking-extradition-of-former-spanish-officials.php">issued warrants</a> [JURIST report] for four former Spanish officials accused of human rights violations during the Franco regime. In September 2010 an appeals court in Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/argentina-appeals-court-re-opens-investigation-into-spanish-civil-war-crimes.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into crimes against humanity committed in Spain during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime. The case was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/argentina-citizens-seeking-judicial.php">brought to federal court in April 2010</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/forum/2010/06/argentina-jurisdiction-and-spanish-amnesty.php">op-ed</a>] by Argentinian relatives of Spanish citizens killed during the Franco regime. The Spanish Supreme Court charged National Court Judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=garzon">news archive</a>] with abusing power by <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordering the exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite the 1977 law. He was acquitted in a 6-1 <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/spain-high-court-acquits-judge-garzon-in-abuse-of-power-case.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial/Tribunal_Supremo">Spanish Supreme Court</a> [official website] in 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

(JPM) [corporate website] will pay the US government $614 million and improve company mortgage lending practices under a settlement announced Tuesday for claims it approved thousands of unqualified home mortgage loans for government insurance since 2002 and cost the government millions of dollars when the loans defaulted. As part of the settlement, JPMorgan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/jpmorgan-settle-idUSL2N0L928N20140205">admitted</a> [Reuters report] that it approved thousands of insured loans that were ineligible for insurance by the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official websites]. "For years, JPMorgan Chase has enjoyed the privilege of participating in federally subsidized programs aimed at helping millions of Americans realize the dream of homeownership," US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said in a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2014/February/14-civ-120.html">statement</a> [text] released by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website].<blockquote>Yet, for more than a decade, it abused that privilege. JPMorgan Chase put profits ahead of responsibility by recklessly churning out thousands of defective mortgage loans, failing to inform the government of known problems with those loans and leaving the government to cover the losses when the loans defaulted. With today's settlement, however, JPMorgan Chase has accepted responsibility for its misconduct and has committed to reform its business practices. This settlement adds to the list of successful mortgage fraud cases this office has pursued.</blockquote>The settlement was filed in <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], and approved by Judge J Paul Oetken. 

<p>JPMorgan has been under intense scrutiny by US government agencies in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. In November, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/doj-finalizes-13-billion-settlement-with-jpmorgan-for-toxic-mortgages.php">finalized</a> [JURIST report] a $13 billion civil settlement with JPMorgan that resolved federal and state claims arising from the bank's risky mortgage practices that helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. In August the company <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-attorneys-investigating-jpmorgan-for-violation-of-federal-securities-laws.php">disclosed</a> [JURIST report] in its quarterly filing with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] that it is being investigated by both the civil and criminal divisions of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/">US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California</a> (EDC) [official website] over sales of mortgage-backed securities to investors leading up to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. JPMorgan's disclosures came one day after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-sues-bank-of-america-for-fraud-relating-to-financial-crisis.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website], claiming the corporation misled investors about securitized loans worth more than $850 million. In an announcement earlier that week, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-ag-886.html">remarked</a> [press release] that the suit against BOA prove that the <a href="http://www.stopfraud.gov/">Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force</a> [official website] is taking an aggressive approach to uncovering abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The reports findings will be incorporated into an upcoming meeting of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] sponsored by the US. The report, which was conducted by PIAC's International Crimes Evidence Project, details indiscriminate bombing in civilian areas, denial of humanitarian assistance, extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and enforced disappearance and calls for an international investigation. 

<p>The report comes amid mounting pressure on the Sri Lankan government from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/asia/new-inquiry-on-sri-lanka-points-to-possible-war-crimes.html?_r=0">human rights groups and the international community</a> [NYT report] to investigate and prosecute abuses during the conflict with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/separatist-terrorism/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder].

<p>Wednesday's lawsuit in Germany is merely one of a number lawsuits that Apple has been party to regarding patent infringement.

The announcement of the agreement came from Russian officials and was also announced on Syrian television and radio stations. It comes only a week after the Obama administration criticized Syria's delay in disposing of its chemical weapon supply. Only 4 percent of Syria's most dangerous chemical weapons have been <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2014/02/05/Syria-signs-agreements-on-chemical-weapons-disposal/UPI-65661391578200/">disposed of</a> [UPI report] at this point, although all of these weapons were supposed to have been disposed of by December 31 of last year, according to prior agreements. The OPCW <a href="http://www.opcw.org/news/article/director-general-need-to-pick-up-pace-in-removing-chemicals-from-syria-1/">reported</a> [press release] that two shipments of Syria's chemical weapons have been made within the month of January, however, that the disposal process must be completed faster. It is expected that the disposal process will be completed by March 1. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years. The conflict has been highlighted by countless human rights violations and use of chemical weaponry, which has created mounting pressure among the international community to find an end to the conflict. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to the Security Council, which highlights the severe suffering faced by children in Syria during the period between March 2011 and November 2013. The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have killed and tortured extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children as well. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-syria-government-responsible-for-demolitions-of-residential-areas.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] last week that Syrian authorities had deliberately demolished residential neighborhoods with explosives and bulldozers in Damascus and Hama over the last year. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the current regime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), a group that was recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/al-qaeda-disavows-any-ties-with-radical-islamist-isis-group-in-syria-iraq/2014/02/03/2c9afc3a-8cef-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1_story.html">disavowed</a> [<em>WP</em> report] by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">Al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], has claimed responsibility for the January 20, 2014 murders. A video posted online depicted ISIS members shooting and disabling a SWAT truck, taking four SWAT members into custody, interviewing them, and then shooting them in the back of the head. In the press release, HRW deputy Middle East director Joe Stork condemned the ISIS attacks: "These abhorrent killings are the latest in a long list of ISIS atrocities. ... Together with the ISIS car bombs and suicide attacks targeting civilians, they are further evidence of crimes against humanity." In another video online, the father of one of the executed SWAT members said that  ISIS had contacted him about the capture and demanded that the father call Iraq's <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic] and tell him to withdraw Iraqi forces from the Anbar region.

<p>Authorities in Iraq have attempted a significant crackdown on alleged domestic terrorists in recent months. The <a href="http://www.moj.gov.iq/">Iraq Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] announced in January the execution by hanging of 11 Iraqi prisoners convicted of terrorist attacks against the Iraqi people. These executions came mere days after the country's execution of <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/iraqi-government-executes-26-convicted-for-terrorism-offenses.php">26 Iraqi nationals</a> [JURIST report], also for terrorist related offenses. In December Iraqi police <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/iraqi-police-arrest-sunni-mp-and-protest-supporter-on-terrorism-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a prominent supporter of anti-government protests and charged him with terrorism offenses. Earlier in December UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-experts-call-on-iraqi-government-to-provide-whereabouts-of-7-camp-ashraf-residents.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iraq to provide information on the whereabouts of seven prisoners who were reportedly abducted following the massacre at Camp Ashraf in September. Last October Iraq officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/iraqi-officials-execute-42-people-convicted-on-terrorism-charges.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] 42 people convicted of terrorism charges. JURIST Columnist Haider Ala Hamoudi of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law <a href="/forum/2013/12/haider-hamoudi-iraqi-constitutional.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that as Iraq's new government matures, the country must address critical issues left ambiguous in the initial constitution, and the execution style killings demand urgent attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter was in response to three cases involving allegations of false advertising of food products; more specifically, whether food products containing bioengineered ingredients may be labeled as &#8220;Natural,&#8221; &#8220;All Natural&#8221; or &#8220;100% Natural.&#8221; The plaintiffs in <u>Cox v. Gruma Corp.</u>, <u>Barnes v. Campbell Soup Co.</u> and <u>In re General Mills, Inc. Kix Cereal Litigation</u> filed suit on the grounds that the defendants' labeling was misleading because the products contained "corn grown from bioengineered, genetically modified seeds." While the agency declined to formulate a formal definition of the term "natural," existing policy [<a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/FoodAdvisoryCommittee/UCM248504.pdf">58 Fed. Reg. 2302, 2407</a>] states that the term "natural" on food labels means that "nothing artificial synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to a food that would not normally be expected to be in the food." Defending their decision not to promulgate the definition, the FDA stated that adding policy would require a public process, rather than private litigation. The FDA also noted that food labeling involves the interests of other federal agencies,including the US <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] as both agencies, according to the letter, have been considering the issue of the term "natural" beyond the scope of the genetically modified foods.

<p>The FDA has been in the legal news recently for their involvement in two ongoing controversies: lethal injection and <a href="/feature/featured/contraception-mandate/">contraceptives</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In July the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fda-cannot-allow-import-of-execution-drug.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an FDA policy allowing the importation of a drug used in the execution of state prisoners was illegal. The court did not give deference to the federal agency's policy of neither approving or reviewing shipments of sodium thiopental from <a href="http://www.dreampharma.com/">Dream Pharma</a> [corporate website], a British manufacturer, because the policy was arbitrary and capricious. In June the FDA <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/fda-lifts-age-restrictions-for-emergency-contraception.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it has officially approved the brand-name emergency contraceptive Plan B One-step for all women of child-bearing potential without a prescription, regardless of age. This approval comes following an <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Korman-order-6-12-13.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-approves-fda-emergency-contraceptive-plan.php">report]</a> issued last week by Judge Edward Korman of the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website], who has been overseeing the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Plan+B">Plan B litigation</a> [JURIST news archive] for more than six years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police Commissioner William Bratton <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/30/stop-and-frisk-appeal-dropped-mayor-de-blasio_n_4695930.html">supported</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] de Blasio's decision to drop the appeal. Bratton believes that the policy has caused distrust between the people of New York and the police and that the police must now fix this relationship. Bloomberg staunchly supported the stop-and-frisk policy, but de Blasio made reforming the policy a major component of his campaign. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] gave several police unions the opportunity to challenge the city's request to return the case to the lower court since the city abandoned the appeal. 

<p>Criticism of NYPD's stop-and-frisk procedure revolves primarily around the <a href="/forum/2013/03/mclaughlin-jarrell-stop-and-frisk.php">relevant racial issues involved</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Critics claim the <a href="/dateline/2013/10/edwar-estrada-nyc-discrimination.php">procedures are unconstitutional</a> [JURIST op-ed] because they unfairly target minorities, who are disproportionately selected for stops and searches. Other criticisms indicate that the procedure itself is <a href="/hotline/2013/08/samar-warsi-stop-frisk.php">unwieldy and ineffective</a> [JURIST op-ed], emphasizing quantity of searches over their quality and resulting in an unnecessary drain on department time and resources. In November the court blocked NYPD stop-and-frisk changes. In the period between 2004 and 2011 only 1.5 percent of the 2.3 million searches conducted revealed an illegal weapon. In September Judge Shira Scheindlin <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-rejects-plea-to-delay-stop-and-frisk-order.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the City of New York to stay her order requiring a halt of the stop-and-frisk procedure. In February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-grants-class-action-status-to-challenge-of-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] class action status to those challenging the procedure. That decision followed an order in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-1.php">allowing</a> [JURIST report] the searches to resume after a previous ruling had required them to stop.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In December a judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's same-sex marriage ban. In response, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-puts-temporary-hold-on-utah-same-sex-marriage.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state on January 6. The brief couches much of its argument on the "States' traditional authority over marriage"  and "Utah's compelling interest in and commitment to children being raised by a biological mother and father, or other man-woman unions." In their brief, the state attorneys contend that "as between mutually exclusive models of marriage, the man-woman model is simply the one the state and its people believe is best for children." A hearing in the case <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/us-usa-gaymarriage-utah-idUSBREA131SJ20140205">is expected</a> [Reuters report] on April 10 in Denver.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a widely debated issue in the US. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], in conjunction with a private law firm, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-challenges-utahs-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="https://www.utcourts.gov/courts/dist/distsites/3rd/slc.html">Third Judicial District Court for the State of Utah Salt Lake County</a> [official website] on behalf of four same-sex married couples in Utah. The Utah Attorney General originally filed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-stay-same-sex-marriage-order.php">application for stay</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court on January 2, to block same-sex marriages pending the state's appeal of December's district court decision, which struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban. The day after the Supreme Court responded by temporarily halting the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses in the state, the office of Utah Governor Gary Herbert sent an e-mail to state Cabinet members, directing them to place legal recognition of same-sex marriages within the state <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-governor-directs-cabinet-not-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">on hold</a> [JURIST report] until further notice. On January 10 US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed in the state of Utah, despite the state's determination that it will put recognition of same-sex marriages on hold indefinitely.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW found that officials are coercing confessions and holding trial proceedings far below the international standard. HRW's report includes interviews with imprisoned women, their families, their lawyers and prison medical staff, along with court documents and information from meetings with Iraqi officials. This report came after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11733715">Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] promised to reform Iraq's criminal justice system in January 2013.

<p>The human rights situation in Iraq remains fragile.

In May 2012 UNAMI reported that the human rights situation in Iraq continued to struggle during the nation's transition from a decade-long dictatorship to a peaceful democratic system. UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/iraq-human-rights-situation-still-fragile-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011 that human rights abuses continued to plague various regions of Iraq. In December 2008 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iraq-human-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that while general security conditions in Iraq have improved, human rights violations continued, particularly with respect to the treatment of detainees in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bench card, which is the first of its kind in this country, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/court-takes-swift-action-end-debtors-prison">gives legal alternatives</a> [ACLU report] to debtors' prisons, such as forfeiting one's driver's license, and describes procedures for determining one's ability to pay fines. This action comes as a result from an <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio</a> [advocacy website] report, <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/TheOutskirtsOfHope2013_04.pdf">The Outskirts of Hope</a> [text, PDF], which documented the practice in seven counties and showed how imprisonment caused hardship for both debtors and Ohio taxpayers. Courts are required by law to hold hearings in order to establish a defendant's financial status before jailing them for failure to pay court fines and prohibits the jailing of a defendant if he or she is unable to pay.

<p>In April the ACLU of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/aclu-urges-ohio-supreme-court-to-end-debtors-prisons.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] urging the Ohio Supreme Court to bring an end to the state's practice of jailing people who cannot pay their court fines. The brief reflected the findings of an ACLU investigation launched in 2012. In 2010, the ACLU released a report entitled <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/InForAPenny_web.pdf">"In for a Penny: The Rise of America's New Debtors' Prisons"</a> [text, PDF] profiling five states, including Ohio, which participate in the practice of so-called "debtors' prisons." Under this system, individuals who fail to pay their sentenced fines and court costs are assigned a monthly payment plan. If he or she does not make these payments, an arrest warrant will be issued, and the individual will be incarcerated for 10 days without bond. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The plan sets aside $17.5 million annually for 20 years from funds the state received in a settlement with tobacco manufacturers. This is a major step towards the funding of the pension plans, which are in danger of being cut in an effort to reduce the city's debt. While Snyder's budget is controversial, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/05/usa-michigan-budget-detroit-idUSL2N0LA1EN20140205">reports indicate</a> [Reuters report] that the state's Speaker of the House is willing to consider such a use of state funds. Detroit has also been promised $350 million in state funds in an effort to keep city artwork, as well as $470 million from other foundations hoping to ensure the pensions are fully funded.

<p>Detroit's bankruptcy matter has been <a href="/forum/2013/12/charles-tabb-detroit-bankruptcy.php">increasingly controversial</a> and has <a href="/dateline/2013/09/patrick-brady-detroit-bankruptcy.php">sparked debate</a> on the <a href="/dateline/2013/08/igor-shleypak-detroit-bankruptcy.php">surrounding issues</a> [JURIST op-eds] since the city filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July of last year. Earlier this week Detroit <a href=".org/paperchase/2014/02/detroit-files-lawsuit-to-invalidate-144-billion-of-pension-debt.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit to invalidate $1.44 billion of pension debt. A judge for the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in January <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/detroit-bankruptcy-165-million-settlement-struck-down.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a proposed $165 million settlement agreement for the city of Detroit to pay off UBS and Bank of America. In December a judge ordered the city to renegotiate its bankruptcy-related financing with UBS and Bank of America, serving as the impetus for this week's proposed settlement between the parties. Earlier in December a judge ruled that Detroit is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-court-rules-detroit-eligible-for-bankruptcy.php">eligible and authorized</a> [JURIST report] to file for bankruptcy, declaring the city insolvent because it owes approximately $18 billion to more than 100,000 creditors, which is harming the city's residents and making it essentially impossible for the city to negotiate with creditors. In July a judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-clears-way-for-detroit-bankruptcy-case.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] Detroit's bankruptcy filing to continue, declaring that his federal bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. This action placed a stay on a Michigan circuit court ruling that had been announced three days earlier, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/michigan-judge-rules-detroit-bankruptcy-filing-unconstitutional.php">declared the filing unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because it threatened public pension benefits and those benefits are protected by the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/constitution.pdf">Michigan Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Mark Goldsmith found that the law violates the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/historical/miconstitution1850.htm">Michigan constitution's</a> [text] "change of purpose" clause. The law was <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140205/SCHOOLS/302050106/Federal-judge-strikes-down-state-law-banning-unionization-graduate-students">rushed through the statehouse</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report] having several unrelated amendments tacked on to it. This, Goldsmith ruled, was also a violation of the "title-object" clause, which prevents legislation from being passed when there are many disparate matters attached. The law prevented University of Michigan research assistants from unionizing. This prompted the <a href="http://aftmichigan.org/">American Federation of Teachers</a> (AFT) Michigan [advocacy website] to bring the suit. Pro-union groups hailed the decision as striking down a law that prevented the constitutional right to organize. Supporters of the anti-union law, however, argue that the law was necessary to prevent unionized researchers from taking advantage of universities.

<p>Michigan has been controversial in it treatment of certain <a href="/feature/featured/right-to-work/">Right to Work</a> [JURIST backgrounder] issues. In August a Michigan appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/michigan-appeals-court-rules-right-to-work-law-applies-to-state-employees.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the term "right to work" applied to state employees. That legislation was originally passed in December 2012. In January the <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan</a> (ALCUM) [advocacy website] and various labor organizations collectively filed similar lawsuits in state court against both the private and public sector laws, claiming that while the legislation was debated and passed, the public was prohibited from entering the Capitol through the public entrance by Michigan state police, effecting a "total denial of public access to the Capitol for over four hours" in contravention of the Michigan Open Meetings Act, the Michigan Constitution and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1toc_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. Previously, the governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">requested an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] from the Michigan Supreme Court, following its September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">order</a> [JURIST report] that a collective bargaining initiative appear in a constitutional referendum.</p>

Workers interviewed by HRW claimed that some managers mistreated those involved in organizing unions in incidents ranging from death threats to acts of violence and forced resignations, despite amendments to the country's labor laws in July that included the freedom to form trade unions. Many female workers say that they also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/06/us-bangladesh-labour-rights-idUSBREA150YN20140206">received threats</a> [Reuters report] of a sexual nature. According to HRW Asia Director Brad Adams, "The best way to ... end the exploitation of Bangladeshi workers is to encourage the establishment of independent trade unions to monitor and protect workers&#8217; rights." A statement from <a href="http://www.mole.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=404&Itemid=463">Labor Secretary Mikail Shipar</a> [official profile] suggested that conditions within the country were improving, saying that 99 trade unions had been registered since the July amendment and that the complaints of 16 trade unions against their owners are being investigated.

<p>This call to protect the rights of Bangladeshi workers to organize follows the country's <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-lawmakers-approve-changes-to-labor-law.php">approval of a new labor law</a> [JURIST report] in July in response to the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/25/bangladesh-tragedy-shows-urgency-worker-protections">collapse</a> [press release] of the Rana Plaza building which killed about 1,129 garment workers in April. The change came in an effort to update the Bangladeshi laws to meet international standards. Bangladesh has ratified most of the core <a href="http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/promoting-international-labor-standards/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> [official website] labor standards, including Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and Convention No. 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. According to the World Factbook, garment exports totaled USD $12.3 billion in 2009 and $11 billion in 2010, accounting for almost 12 percent of GDP. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The experts claimed that these actions are part of a "systematic effort to cause civilian suffering." In their report, they warned of an increase in shelling of civilians, enforced disappearances and executions. In calling all sides to halt such actions, the group noted:<blockquote>Depriving people of their access to food and water, impeding their access to health services and wantonly destroying their housing constitute clear violations of the human rights to food, to water, to sanitation, to housing, to health, and to freedom from inhumane treatment, protected under international human rights treaties... Apart from obstructing humanitarian access through sieges and tight check-points, attacks have been carried out to destroy harvests, kill livestock, and cut off water supplies, with the apparent aim of starving out the targeted populations. At the same time, entire neighborhoods and residences are being razed, aggravating the dire housing situation, causing further displacement.</blockquote>The experts include the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. There are reportedly more than 100,000 people trapped in Yarmouk Camp that are at risk of starvation. In addition, more than a quarter million people are living in cities essentially under siege.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years. The conflict has been highlighted by countless human rights violations and use of chemical weaponry, which has created mounting pressure among the international community to find an end to the conflict. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to the Security Council, which highlights the severe suffering faced by children in Syria during the period between March 2011 and November 2013. The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have killed and tortured extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children as well. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-syria-government-responsible-for-demolitions-of-residential-areas.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] last week that Syrian authorities had deliberately demolished residential neighborhoods with explosives and bulldozers in Damascus and Hama over the last year. The main opposition group within Syria, the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/">Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], recently agreed to attend the Geneva II conference after an invitation to Iran was rescinded by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Following Iran's original invitation to Geneva II, the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/syria-opposition-group-refuses-to-attend-peace-talks-if-iran-also-attends.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would refuse to attend the peace talks if Iran was in attendance. Iran is the primary international supporter of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the current regime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Amid claims that this is an act of censorship, government officials have maintained that the bill is intended to promote the protection of privacy. Many have expressed concern that the new legislation marks the government's attempt to control the information during the current corruption scandal, in which Turkish <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13746679">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] named 10 new members of his Cabinet following the resignation of three members under investigation for graft. The bill still needs to be signed by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17992010">President Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC profile] before it can be implemented. 

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world. Last year a Canadian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">unveiled research</a> [JURIST report] indicating that a number of nations are using American-made Internet surveillance technology which could be used to censor content and track their citizens. The UN Human Rights Council in July 2012 passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect the free speech</a> [JURIST report] of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. Also in 2012 China <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">adopted stricter rules</a> [JURIST report] on both Internet providers and users. Last November Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] giving the nation the authority to completely block access to certain websites.

The ruling means the German court will not cut the program, which could alarm investors that rely on the plan to stabilize the Euro. The court stated:<blockquote>In the view of the Senate, there are important reasons to assume that it exceeds the European Central Bank's monetary policy mandate and thus infringes the powers of the Member States, and that it violates the prohibition of monetary financing of the budget. While the Senate is thus inclined to regard the OMT Decision as an ultra vires act, it also considers it possible that if the OMT Decision were interpreted restrictively in the light of the Treaties, conformity with primary law could be achieved.</blockquote>Germany's Bundesbank brought the lawsuit against the plan, alleging it violated German law. The ECB has no plans to use the OMT in the near future. There is currently no date set for the ECJ to review the OMT, but a full ruling could reported take years.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing struggle to maintain stability in the EU. In September, EU parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-parliament-approves-new-bank-supervisory-mechanism.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new bank supervisory mechanism. Last November the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the <a href="http://www.esm.europa.eu/">European Stability Mechanism</a> (ESM) [official website; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19870747">backgrounder</a>], is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports]. Last June the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-proposes-regulations-to-address-future-financial-crises.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/crisis-management/2012_eu_framework/COM_2012_280_en.pdf">proposal</a> [text, PDF] that would address the problems of bailing out large banks with public funds during financial crises in the future. The proposal rests on Article 114 of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:en:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the EU</a> (TFEU) [text, PDF] which "allows the adoption of measures for the approximation of national provisions which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the international market."</p>]]></content:encoded>

After more than three weeks of debate, lawmakers in the DRC approved the law on Tuesday amid <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/29/dr-congo-letter-president-joseph-kabila-prosecuting-m23-leaders-and-others-serious-a">outcry</a> [open letter] from human rights advocates, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. According to HRW, the bill offers impunity for <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/05/dr-congo-war-crimes-m23-congolese-army">numerous war crimes</a> [HRW report] committed by the rebel group <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20438531">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">news archive</a>] and Congolese military forces during M23's occupation of Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2012. M23 officially withdrew from Goma on December 1 after the Congolese government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/01/congo-democratic-idUSL5N0B140F20130201">agreed to negotiations</a> [Reuters report], which resulted in the approval of Tuesday's law. President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16120557">Joseph Kabila</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kabila">news archive</a>] is expected to officially approve and sign it soon. 

<p>Human rights and humanitarian concerns continue to be a concern surrounding the violence in the DRC. Last September, a top UN official emphasized the need to <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-expert-calls-for-international-community-to-address-impunity-in-drc.php">address the issue of impunity</a> [JURIST report] for those involved in human rights violations over the past year. The month before, UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-expert-calls-for-drc-to-respect-human-rights.php">emphasized </a>[JURIST report] the importance of respecting human rights in the DRC. In July HRW reported that the M23 was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/hrw-drc-rebels-recieving-aid-from-rwanda-despite-abuses.php">receiving assistance from Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] despite continued human rights abuses by the rebel group, including rape, executions and forced recruitment of young boys. In May a UN report found that DRC troops <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/drc-military-committed-rape-murder-un-report.php">committed rape and murder</a> [JURIST report] as they retreated from an advance by M23 rebels last November. In February HRW reported that during the siege of Goma, M23 forces <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">summarily executed 24 individuals</a> [JURIST report], 21 of whom were civilians, and raped 36 women, including a 10-year-old girl. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Wyoming's ordinance directly conflicts with the state's law by imposing penalties for an act protected by the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act. The court also found that the state's law was <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20140207/NEWS06/302070022/medical-marijuana-local-ordinance-Michigan">not invalidated</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report] by federal law criminalizing marijuana because the state law, which legalizes use of the substances for a limited class of individuals, does not interfere with federal enforcement of the prohibition. The ruling may invalidate related ordinances in other cities as well, including Livonia and Bloomfield Hills.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">Marijuana legalization</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has created controversy in the US and abroad, and JURIST Guest Columnist Alex Kriet predicts that 2014 will be a <a href="/forum/2013/11/alex-kreit-marijuana-legalization.php">groundbreaking year</a> [JURIST op-ed] for marijuana policy. In January the Florida Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/florida-voters-to-decide-on-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a citizen initiative to vote on the legality of medical marijuana.

A <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/cache/offonce/home/news/pid/16602;jsessionid=1C3357804D5240F6D3DB37153EF76098.jahia02">statement</a> [text] from <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/about/ed/bio">Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin</a> [official profile], Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/home;jsessionid=D388D441D66AA47B0BAA72AA216A3B9D.jahia01">UN Population Fund</a> (UNFPA) [official website], called FGM/C an affront to human dignity and an unacceptable continuing human rights violation. The statement was made to mark Thursday's <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/femalegenitalmutilationday/">International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation</a> [UN profile], which was sponsored by every country in Africa and embraced by the entire membership of the UN. While Osotimehin did note the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/www.wmo.int/story.asp?NewsID=47092&Cr=genital&Cr1=#.UvUMbYXMYdx">acceleration of progress</a> [UN News Centre report] in eradicating the harmful practice, with Uganda, Kenya and Guinea-Bissau adopting laws criminalizing FGM/C, he also stressed that the challenge of eliminating it required increased efforts. In a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=7447">statement</a> [text] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on people to "strive to preserve the best in any culture, and leave harm behind." The UN and their partners, he said, are engaged in culturally sensitive activities that aim to stop FGM without scolding or shame as well as helping those affected by FGM. The president of the General Assembly, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/68/pdf/presskit/biography.pdf">John Ashe</a> [official profile], also <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/68/news/international_day_of_zero_tolerance_to_fgm.shtml">spoke on the matter</a> [press release], calling on governments, civil society organizations, religious leaders and community groups to work together to promote an end to the deeply-entrenched practice.

<p>In July <a href="http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58002.html">UNICEF</a> [official website] released a comprehensive new report revealing that FGM/C is <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/unicef-female-genital-mutilation-on-decline.php">on the decline</a> [JURIST report] around the world. The report indicates that as many as 125 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of FGM/C. The UNFPA and UNICEF reported in February that <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-call-for-end-to-female-genital-mutilation.php">significant progress has been made</a> [JURIST report] in ending the practice of FGM/C but called upon the international community to do more to end the practice. In November 2012 a UN panel urged countries to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">ban</a> [JURIST reports] FGM/C. In February 2012 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-reports-progress-in-ending-female-genital-mutilation.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] similar progress in ending the practice. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called on the government of<a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php"> Iraqi Kurdistan</a> [JURIST report] to outlaw female FGM/C. <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">Uganda</a> [JURIST report] joined the movement against FGM/C in 2009 by outlawing it, although it is still practiced there. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Shaheed plans to focus her study on the challenges that marketing strategies present to cultural rights such as the right to education, the right to artistic freedom and the right to cultural heritage. The study will encompass the wide variety of marketing techniques including sources from television, print, radio, billboards, branding, Internet, promotions, sponsorships and other strategies. Shaheed has received several human rights awards for her work protecting cultural rights and fostering policies in culturally sensitive ways. 

<p>A human rights mechanism took effect last year that will allow a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/new-un-rights-mechanism-takes-effect.php">UN committee to review complaints</a> [JURIST report] from people or groups who have exhausted every option for justice in their own country regarding economic, social and cultural rights violations. The state party must then give due consideration to the committee's views and recommendations and submit a written response within six months, setting forth any action it has taken. The protocol was created to condemn violations of rights to food, adequate housing, education, or health, as is the standard for civil and political rights violations. Uruguay was the tenth <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-welcomes-mechanism-for-individuals-to-report-human-rights-abuses.php">required country to ratify the protocol</a> [JURIST report], joining Argentina, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. UN High Commissioner <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has requested that the other 160 nations in the UN also ratify the protocol. Some critics have suggested the opt-in nature for the protocol means that many suspect nations will not be governed by the instrument, leaving those people most in danger of rights abuses with no change in their means to report those abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/politics/farm-bill.html">passed the Senate</a> [<em>New York Times</em> report] last week with a bipartisan vote. Beyond expanding federal crop insurance, the farm bill also ends direct government payments for farmers regardless of whether they produce crops. The bulk of its nearly $100 billion per year cost is for the food stamp program, although it will cut food stamps by $8 billion over the next 10 years, which is considerably short of the Republican call for food stamp cuts of up to $40 billion. In addition to replacing some subsidies with increased crop insurance, the law also includes new food labeling regulations and soil conservation measures. "Despite its name, the farm bill is not just about helping farmers," Obama stated. "It [is] a jobs bill, an innovation bill, an infrastructure bill, a research bill, [and] a conservation bill."

<p>Several cases regarding agriculture have reached the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] in recent years. In June 2013, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-in-california-raisins-takings-case.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] had jurisdiction to review takings claims by a California raisin grower that faced fines after refusing to turn over their crops. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-for-monsanto-in-seed-patent-dispute.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Monsanto">news archive</a>] in a May 2013 opinion on a seed patent dispute. They ruled that a farmer who buys patented seeds may not reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission. In December 2012, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-rules-government-not-immune-under-takings-clause-for-man-made-floods.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government does not receive automatic immunity under the Takings Clause of the <a href="http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment5/amendment.html">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] in a case against the <a href="http://www.agfc.com/Pages/default.aspx">Arkansas Game &#38; Fish Commission</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuits <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-06/merck-said-to-agree-to-100-million-nuvaring-settlement.html">allege</a> [<em>Bloomberg</em> report] that NuvaRing potentially causes fatal blood clots. The settlement will provide an average payment of over $58,000 per case. This settlement is less than other contraceptive makers have had to pay in similar lawsuits. For example, last year <a href="http://www.bayer.com/">Bayer AG</a> [corporate website] paid more than $1.6 billion to settle claims related to Yasmin and Yaz contraceptive pills. A 2011 US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/default.htm">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] report linked NuvaRing to a higher risk of blood clots, and the plaintiffs allege that are almost a dozen filings showing that the type of chemical progestin used in NuvaRing is twice as likely to cause blood clots than other types of progestin. The plaintiffs contend that Merck failed to provide proper warnings about the higher clot risk. The settlement agreement requires at least 95 percent participation from the 3,800 people eligible to participate. Merck <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/02/07/merck-to-settle-contraceptive-product-liability-lawsuits/">denies fault</a> [WSJ report] under the settlement, and the settlement would cover cases filed in both state and federal courts, as well as some unfiled claims. 

<p>The FDA has been in the legal news recently for their involvement in two ongoing controversies: lethal injection and <a href="/feature/featured/contraception-mandate/">contraceptives</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In June the FDA <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/fda-lifts-age-restrictions-for-emergency-contraception.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it has officially approved the brand-name emergency contraceptive Plan B One-step for all women of child-bearing potential without a prescription, regardless of age. This approval came following an <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-approves-fda-emergency-contraceptive-plan.php">order</a> [JURIST report] issued the prior week by Judge Edward Korman of the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website], who has been overseeing the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Plan+B">Plan B litigation</a> [JURIST news archive] for more than six years. JURIST Guest Columnist Alyson Schwartz argues that the FDA's actions with regard to emergency contraception has <a href="/dateline/2013/08/alyson-schwartz-emergency-contraception.php">marked a turn away from political maneuvering</a> [JURIST op-ed] and a return to their health-based mission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontnypd.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] On Friday, a group of police unions filed a motion to block <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/">Mayor Bill de Blasio's</a> [official website] proposed settlement and removal of former mayor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1640778.stm">Michael Bloomberg's</a> [BBC profile] appeal of the stop and frisk policy. The motion was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ny-police-unions-seek-stop-frisk-appeals-ruling-22417428">filed</a> [AP report] in the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] in response to de Blasio's recent decision to drop the city's appeal. Police Commissioner William Bratton <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/30/stop-and-frisk-appeal-dropped-mayor-de-blasio_n_4695930.html">supported</a> [AP report] de Blasio's decision to drop the appeal. Bloomberg staunchly supported the stop-and-frisk policy, but de Blasio made reforming the policy a major component of his campaign. The unions claim the settlement shed a negative light on police officers by declaring their policy unconstitutional and requiring an oversight panel over the police departments. Even though the city is withdrawing their appeal, the unions argue that the appeals court ruling should still be reviewed.

<p>Criticism of NYPD's stop-and-frisk procedure revolves primarily around the <a href="/forum/2013/03/mclaughlin-jarrell-stop-and-frisk.php">relevant racial issues involved</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Critics claim the <a href="/dateline/2013/10/edwar-estrada-nyc-discrimination.php">procedures are unconstitutional</a> [JURIST op-ed] because they unfairly target minorities, who are disproportionately selected for stops and searches. Other criticisms indicate that the procedure itself is <a href="/hotline/2013/08/samar-warsi-stop-frisk.php">unwieldy and ineffective</a> [JURIST op-ed], emphasizing quantity of searches over their quality and resulting in an unnecessary drain on department time and resources. De Blasio's decision to drop the appeal was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/new-york-mayor-drops-appeal-to-stop-and-frisk-reform.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week.

The <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] is collecting less than 30 percent of all Americans' phone records due to the inability to keep up with the increased use of cellular phones, according to disclosures made by current and former US officials on Friday. This contradicts the widely-held belief that the government is collecting all domestic phone records, and it is likely to raise concerns regarding the reliability and effectiveness of the program. As recent as 2006, the NSA was collecting close to 100 percent of Americans' phone records from a number of US companies. However, as of last summer, that number has fallen below 30 percent as more Americans have increased cellphone usage. While the NSA has obtained approval to gather data on land line calls from certain carriers, it has not yet gone after data from mobile phone calls. In trying to restore the collection, the NSA is preparing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-is-collecting-less-than-30-percent-of-us-call-data-officials-say/2014/02/07/234a0e9e-8fad-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html">to seek court orders</a> [Washington Post report] to compel more wireless companies to turn in their records to the government.

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. In late January, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-terror-suspect-challenge-constitutionality-of-nsa-surveillence-program.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of terror suspect Jamshid Muhtorov to suppress evidence the NSA obtained from surveillance conducted pursuant to the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/laws/pl110261.pdf">FISA Amendments Act of 2008</a> (FAA) [text, PDF]. Also last month, the<a href="http://www.pclob.gov/"> Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board</a> (PCLOB) [official website], an independent agency created by Congress to protect American privacy under anti-terrorism laws, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-privacy-board-finds-nsa-phone-program-illegal.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] calling the NSA's metadata program illegal and saying that it should be ended. Earlier in January, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-pledges-an-end-to-nsas-mass-collection-practices.php">announced detailed plans</a> [JURIST report] to change surveillance policy, curbing the abilities of intelligence agencies to collect and use American phone data. Also last month the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/gathering-phone-records-unlawful.php">filed an appeal</a> to a federal district court ruling that held that the NSA program is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-against-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">likely unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. Meanwhile, in December, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] ruled  that the NSA's collection of American citizens' telephone records is <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-nsa-data-collection-legal-and-useful.php">legal</a> [JURIST report]. In September the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-intelligence-court-releases-opinion-justifying-constitutionality-of-surveillance-program.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a previously <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/791759/br13-09-primary-order.pdf">classified opinion</a> [text, PDF] explaining why an NSA program to keep records of Americans' phone calls is constitutional. Also in September the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-urges-obama-administration-to-curb-fbi-surveillance-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration to curb the FBI's surveillance powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/06/tunisia-free-blogger-jailed-mocking-islam">urged</a> [press release] Tunisian authorities, in celebration of the country's new constitution, to quash the sentences of anyone convicted under laws that violate human rights, including Jaber Mejri. In March 2012, Mejri and another blogger, Ghazi Beji, were sentenced to more than seven years in prison for harming "public order or good morals" and "insulting others through public communication networks" after publishing caricatures on his blog deemed insulting to Islam. Beji fled to France where he gained political asylum since the 2011 revolution. However, according to HRW, Tunisian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14107555">President Moncef Marzouki</a> [BBC profile] has the authority to pardon Mejri and should. "Tunisia's new constitution has bold protections for freedom of speech and freedom of conscience," HRW's deputy Middle East and North Africa director Eric Goldstein said. "Mejri's sentence violates his freedom of speech, and the government should celebrate the new day in Tunisia by freeing him." Tunisia's new constitution protects the right to "freedom of opinion, thought expression, information and publication," as well as a provision that protects public freedoms from authorities. "In congratulating Tunisians on their constitution, leaders of other countries at the ceremony should urge authorities to release people such as Mejri, whose conviction seems to contradict the rights enshrined in the new constitution," Goldstein said. 

<p>Tunisia has faced political turmoil since Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. Last month, Tunisia's <a href="http://www.ministeres.tn/">parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/tunisia-adopts-new-constitution.php">passed the new constitution</a> [JURIST report], with 200 out of 216 members voting in favor of the draft. It is the first constitution since the ousting of president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine El Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] Also last month, Tunisian members of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/tunisia-assembly-opts-for-civil-law-over-shari-in-constitution.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Islam as the main source of law for the country as they voted to establish a new constitution. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-assassination-of-tunisian-opposition-leader.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the assassination of a Tunisian opposition leader. In May HRW urged Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-tunisia-should-modify-draft-constitution-to-protect-human-rights.php">modify its draft constitution</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protection of human rights. Two months earlier HRW urged Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-tunisia-to-repeal-criminal-defamation-law.php">repeal its criminal defamation law</a> [JURIST report], which is typically considered a civil offense throughout the world. That same month Tunisian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/tunisia-lawmakers-vote-on-timetable-for-constitution-and-elections.php">voted to approve</a> [JURIST report] a timetable for its draft constitution and national elections. In October 2012 HRW called on Tunisian authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-human-rights-watch-advocacy-2.php">investigate a series of attacks</a> [JURIST report] by religious extremists and to bring those responsible to justice.<br />

These benefits would allow same-sex couples to be covered by spousal privilege in criminal investigations, wherein one spouse cannot be forced to testify against the other. Same-sex couples would also receive visitation rights in prison, and could be allowed escorted leave to attend a spouse's funeral. "In every courthouse, in every proceeding and in every place where a member of the Department of Justice stands on behalf of the United States, they will strive to ensure that same-sex marriages receive the same privileges, protections and rights as opposite-sex marriages," Holder stated in his speech before members of the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) [advocacy website].<blockquote> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PlEptYSgpKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></blockquote> Additionally, the federal government will recognize same-sex couples for programs such as the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/civil/common/reca.html">Radiation Exposure Compensation Program</a> and the <a href="http://www.vcf.gov/">September 11th Victim Compensation Fund</a> [official websites]. Holder states that this new policy memorandum will be issued on Monday.

<p>The federal government has recently made many changes in recognizing the rights of legal <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST backgrounder], largely in response to the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. While the <u>Windsor</u> decision did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, it does entitle couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. The US <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Department of Education</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in December that for the purposes of applying for and receiving federal student financial aid, the federal government will now recognize all legal same-sex marriages. On the same day as this announcement, the US <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection</a> [official website] <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/12/13/federal-agencies-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages/">said </a>[Time report] it will expand the definition of "members of a family residing in a household" to include same-sex couples and other domestic relationships so as to facilitate the declarations process. In September the US <a href="http://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> [official website] issued guidance <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-employee-benefit-plan-purposes.php">explaining</a> [JURIST report] that all legally married same-sex spouses in the US can participate in employee benefit plans overseen by the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/">Employee Benefits Security Administration</a> [official website]. Earlier in September the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/doj-will-not-enforce-law-denying-veterans-benefits-to-same-sex-spouses.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will no longer enforce a federal law that denies same-sex spouses veterans benefits. In August the US <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> [official website] announced that it, along with the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service </a>(IRS) [official website], will <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-to-recognize-all-same-sex-marriages-for-federal-tax-purposes.php">recognize marriages</a> [JURIST report] of all same-sex couples for federal tax purposes. <br />

The statement comes in relation to the trial of two current heads of the Kenyan government, Kenya's president, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a>, and his deputy, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [ICC case materials].

The case of Paul Augustus Howell reached the state high court after a successful appeal to the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the  Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] in 2013. The court of Appeals lifted the stay on Howell's execution in November, and he was scheduled for execution on February 26 before Thursday's court order. The evidentiary hearing, scheduled for a date no later than February 12, will evaluate if the use of midazolam as the first drug in the state's three-drug cocktail violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution</a> [LII backgrounder], prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, the court ordered the <a href="http://www.dc.state.fl.us">Florida Department of Corrections</a> [official website] to obtain information from the drug's manufacturer regarding the history of midazolam in executions. Florida is the only state to use <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state-lethal-injection">midazolam</a> [Death Penalty Information Center report] in a three-drug protocol. Ohio and Louisiana currently employ the drug in their two-drug lethal injection procedure. 

<p>In the US there is a shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols which has resulted in a lawsuits challenging the use of untested drug combinations. Last week, a federal judge in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] a trial to review the constitutionality of the state's new execution protocol, which delayed the prisoner's execution for 90 days. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain and his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bensouda stated that the situation has been rapidly deteriorating and groups have not responded to calls to cease the violence. The Office of the Prosecutor has received and is in the process of reviewing several claims and allegations of "extreme brutality" committed by various groups and organizations on both sides of the fighting. She warned that such offenses were likely to fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC and that individual perpetrators would be held criminally accountable. According to her statement, the reports being reviewed by her office include hundreds of alleged incidents of killing, rape, torture, sexual enslavement, and the recruitment and use of children in the hostilities. The report also stated that many of the victims had been targeted on religious grounds. The ICC will be working alongside CAR officials to gather and analyze evidence to determine if a fully-fledged investigation is warranted. If so, since the CAR is a state party to the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [text], the ICC has jurisdiction over any substantiated claims of war crimes or genocide committed by the country's citizens. 

<p>Last month the UN Security Council unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-bans-travel-freezes-assets-of-central-african-republic-war-crimes-suspects.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution freezing the assets and restricting the travel of several CAR war crimes suspects and authorizing peacekeeping forces to use all "necessary measures" to abate the cycle of violence. Other UN groups have expressed concern over the violence as well, including the offices of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, who in January both issued statements <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] of escalating violence and <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-chief-presses-for-end-to-violence-in-central-african-republic.php">calling</a>  [JURIST report] for its end. Earlier in January EU foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-pledges-troops-and-funds-to-central-african-republic.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] they would be committing one thousand troops to the CAR to assist in peacekeeping efforts, and about a half a billion dollars in humanitarian aids to the victims. Also last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-finds-violations-in-central-african-republic.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] its findings that a large quantity of human rights violations occurred in the CAR during December 2013. The UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">authorized</a> [JURIST report] the use of peacekeeping forces in the CAR on December 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the order Koh also <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2096000/judge-rebukes-apple-for-invoking-nationalist-bias-but-denies-samsung-a-retrial.html">chastised</a> [PC World report] Apple for its closing arguments to the jury, which highlighted Samsung's "foreignness" and reflected what Koh referred to as a "troubling" American-versus-non-American theme. Part of Samsung's request for a retrial was grounded on these arguments, which Samsung's lawyers claimed unfairly invoked racial and national biases in Apple's favor. Though ultimately denying a retrial the order also expressed concern over whether American juries are capable of fairly adjudicating patent disputes between domestic and foreign companies. Koh referred to a study finding a large discrepancy between foreign and domestic companies' patent-infringement lawsuit success rates in jury trials. However, Koh found that Apple's misconduct was not substantial enough to warrant a retrial on that basis alone. Samsung was already granted one retrial in this case, which began in August 2012, that case resulted in Apple being awarded nearly half a billion dollars. In the retrial, which ended in November 2013, Koh <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/us-jury-awards-apple-290-million-in-patent-battle-with-samsung.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] the award to the current amount, $290 million, claiming that the first jury had erred in calculating damages. 

<p>Samsung and Apple have had numerous <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">disputes</a> [JURIST op-ed] over intellectual property in judicial forums all over the globe. The success of either party has also varied with the forum. In August 2013, the International Trade Commission, a US body, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-trade-commission-rules-against-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung had violated patents held by Apple relating to movement tracking on touchscreen devices. In July, a Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-appeals-court-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-suit.php">found</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Samsung in a patent dispute over media-synching software. The parties are <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-samsung-infringed-on-apples-patent.php">currently</a> [JURIST report] in another dispute before Koh relating to alleged infringement of "word reccomendation" technology; that dispute is scheduled to go before a jury in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In June IBAHRI carried out a fact-finding mission in Egypt, where it conducted interviews and examined extant Egyptian law and practice, as well as proposed amendments. Based upon its findings, IBAHRI concluded that, while judicial independence is ostensibly protected by the nation's constitution, the Ministry of Justice is empowered with broad discretion to delegate cases and punish judges, which, in turn, incentivizes the judiciary to propitiate the government. In addition, IBAHRI expressed concern with respect to prosecutorial independence based upon findings that numerous prosecutions appear politically motivated. In support, IBAHRI reported a growing number of civilian prosecutions for "crimes against the military" and for "insulting the president." IBAHRI emphasized that:<blockquote>Judges are an important force in any political transition. At a time when a country's political leaders are being replaced, its constitution and laws rewritten, and former officials standing trial, judges can safeguard&#8212;or undermine&#8212;positive change. Judges who are competent and independent can be the most important guardians of individual freedom, reining in malignant political forces when they encroach on human rights. Judges who are in the government's pocket will instead be used as a conduit for the state's abuses .... Egypt's judges and prosecutors can ensure that they play a key and positive role in the transition to a new democratic state that accounts for the violations of the past and is better able to protect the rights of all citizens.</blockquote>IBAHRI's report is set to go before a panel for discussion with the Law Society of England and Wales on February 10.

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the Egyptian Revolution, and anti-government protesters and supporters of the Islamic <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] continue to fight the military backed government for political control in the country. Earlier this month an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-acquits-al-jazeera-cameraman.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] an Al Jazeera television cameraman and 61 others accused of participating in demonstrations in Cairo last July. In January, Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-prosecutors-charge-20-journalists-with-terrorism-related-charges.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 20 Al Jazeera journalists with joining or conspiring with a terrorist group and broadcasting false images. In January Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it would elect a new president before voting on a parliament. Recently, the Egyptian government took a major step in governmental reform through the drafting of a new constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-constitution-approved-by-98-of-voters.php">ratified</a> [JURIST report] by 98 percent of voters last month. Egyptians <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-egyptian-constitution-approved-according-to-unofficial-results.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] on the new military-backed constitution on January 16, with news reports citing a 42 percent voter turnout rate coupled with serious irregularities in the voting records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ntaganda is accused of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, pillage, using child soldiers and other crimes. Reports indicate Ntaganda <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/10/us-congo-warcrimes-icc-idUSBREA190KR20140210">directed the attacks</a> [Reuters report]  against various ethnic groups, including the Lendu population, in an attempt to force the groups out of the Ituri region between September 2002 and 2003. In March, after a court official read out the charges, Ntaganda said he <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/congo-war-crimes-suspect-denies-charges-in-first-appearance-before-icc-done.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report]. Members of the court cut him off and told him that he did not have to enter a plea at the hearing.

<p>In June the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-delays-preliminary-hearing-for-congo-war-crimes-suspect.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the confirmation of charges hearing for Ntaganda in order to give prosecutors more time to prepare their case. The Congolese general <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/suspected-war-criminal-from-drc-surrenders-to-icc.php">voluntarily turned himself over</a> to the ICC in March following his <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/fugitive-congo-warlord-surrenders-at-us-embassy-in-rwanda.php">surrender to a US embassy</a> [JURIST reports] in Rwanda, marking the first time a wanted person has voluntarily surrendered to the ICC. Human Rights Watch had called for Ntaganda's arrest on multiple occasions: most recently a <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/hrw-congo-president-should-arrest-general-wanted-by-icc.php">direct appeal</a> last year to Democratic Republic of the Congo President Joseph Kabila and previously in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-group-urges-drc-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect.php">during an international conference</a> after its <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">first request in 2010</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno stated that Jiang "exercised supervisory authority over the people who directly committed abuses, which makes him responsible for acts of torture and other major abuses of human rights perpetrated by his subordinates against the people of Tibet." The decision is controversial, even in Spain where the ruling People's party is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/10/spanish-judge-tibet-genocide-china-jiang-zemin-li-peng">considering a rule</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to limit the ability of judges to pursue international crimes against humanity based on universal jurisdiction.

According to the report, 74 percent of the total civilian deaths and injuries in 2013 were inflicted by anti-government forces, and many of those were caused by either suicide attacks or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). In addition to the overall increase in civilian deaths, the report details the increased peril for women and children. 2013 was the worst year since 2009 in terms of the number of women and children killed in conflict-related violence and the UNAMA <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47107&Cr=Afghan&Cr1#.UvkwfWRDt94">called on</a> [UN News Centre report] all parties of the conflict to take further action to protect women and children.

Three of the couples are legally married lesbian couples who have become pregnant through the process of artificial insemination. The fourth couple lives in New York and adopted a boy from Ohio last year. In the suit, the plaintiffs argue that the state's current allowance of only one partner from a same-sex marriage on a birth certificate is a violation of the US Constitution. Many have speculated that this lawsuit seeks to build off of the successful December lawsuit, in which a judge from the same court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-Ohio-must-recognize-same-sex-marriage-on-death-certificates.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state must recognize valid out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples on Ohio death certificates.

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community. Numerous challenges to same-sex marriage bans have arisen before state and federal courts just in the last month. Last week, the Wisconsin branch of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/aclu-files-suit-challenging-wisconsin-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage. On January 23, Virginia Attorney General <a href="http://www.ag.virginia.gov/About%20The%20Attorney%20General/Bio.html">Mark Herring</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he believes the state's ban on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional and he will not defend legal challenges to it, including the case detailed above. On January 22, six same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/same-sex-couples-sue-to-overturn-florida-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Florida state court challenging that state's ban on same-sex marriage. On the same day, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-challenges-utahs-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] Utah's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages performed after the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontbehindbars.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A panel of three federal judges in California on Monday <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3jp-Feb-2014/Three-Judge-Court-order-2-20-2014.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] the state an <a href="http://www.prisonlaw.com/pdfs/Jan2014ExtensionRequest.pdf">extension</a> [text, PDF] until February 28, 2016, to reduce overcrowding in its massive prison system. The California prison system currently houses about 120,000 inmates but is only designed to hold about 80,000. Included in the order is the appointment of a compliance officer to oversee the reforms along with monthly progress reports, and three notable benchmarks: a reduction in the prison population to 143 percent of capacity by June 30, 2014, to 141.5 percent by Feb. 28, 2015, and to 137.5 percent by Feb. 28, 2016. The state must also implement a system of credits for good behavior, alternative incarceration proposals for female inmates, and redesign the parole system for inmates over 60 years old or who have served 25 or more years in prison. The court <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3jp-Feb-2014/Three-Judge-Court-opinion-2-20-2014.pdf">noted</a> [opinion, PDF] California's reluctance to comply with these orders, while encouraging California's new proposals for reform: <blockquote>Thus, while we are reluctant to extend the deadline for two more years, we also acknowledge that defendants have agreed that, with such an extension, they will implement measures that should result in a durable solution to prison overcrowding in California. We recognize that these measures should have been adopted much earlier, that plaintiffs' lawyers have made unceasing efforts to obtain immediate relief on behalf of their clients, and that California prisoners deserve far better treatment than they have received from defendants over the past four and a half years. Similarly, California's citizens have incurred far greater costs, both financial and otherwise, as a result of defendants' heretofore unyielding resistance to compliance with this Court's orders. Finally, we recognize that this Court must also accept part of the blame for not acting more forcefully with regard to defendants' obduracy in the face of its continuing constitutional violations. Nevertheless, resolving the conditions in California prisons for the long run, and not merely for the next few months, is of paramount importance to this Court as well as to the people of this State.</blockquote>In response, California's <a href="http://www.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official profile] <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18399">stated</a> [press release] that "[i]t is encouraging that the Three-Judge Court has agreed to a two-year extension. The state now has the time and resources necessary to help inmates become productive members of society and make our communities safer."

<p>California has been under scrutiny for its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] since 2006, when the state's governor proclaimed a prison overcrowding state of emergency [text]. Last September, Governor Brown <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/california-governor-signs-prison-housing-bill.php">signed into law</a> a <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140SB105&search_keywords=">bill</a> [SB 105, text] that prevents the early release of inmates and allows the state to comply with a federal court order. In July 2013, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/rights-group-urges-improvement-in-california-prison-conditions.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] California to end conditions for prisoners in solitary confinement and order an impartial investigation into the recent death of a prisoner. In January 2013, Governor Brown [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-docs-01-07-13/Terminating-Prison-Overcrowding-Emergency-Proclamation-10-4-06.pdf">proclamation</a> [text, PDF], in order to effectively terminate the 2006 state of emergency and indicated that the circumstances giving rise to the prison overcrowding state of emergency no longer exist within California prisons. In April, however, a panel of federal judges refused to vacate or modify their <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/Order-population-reduction.pdf">2010 order</a> [text, PDF] for reduction of the California inmate population. This order mandated the state to reduce its prison population to within 137.5 percent of institutional design capacity. In May, Governor Brown and various state prison officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-governor-appeals-order-to-curb-prison-overcrowding.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] from the April order. In May 2011 the US Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/USSC-Plata-opinion09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a federal court order that California reduce its state prison population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Better Markets stated of the settlement: <blockquote>[T]hat agreement was a mere contract and was not reviewed or approved by any court. And, it gave JP Morgan Chase complete civil immunity for years of alleged pervasive, egregious and knowing fraudulent and illegal conduct, which contributed to the worst financial crash since 1929 and the worst economy since the 1930's. Adding insult to injury, this deal was cut in secret by the DOJ and JP Morgan Chase with the DOJ acting as investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, sentence and collector without any independent review by a judge. This violates the constitutional separation of powers because there are no checks and balances on the back room deals that DOJ cuts with Wall Street.</blockquote>The settlement does not release JPM from any potential criminal liability over the bad mortgages. Better Markets claimed JPM's settlement lacked critical facts to justify the DOJ's deal, such as names of individuals responsible for the wrongdoing, the amount of damage investors suffered or specific laws violated.

<p>JPMorgan has been under intense scrutiny by US government agencies in the aftermath of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. A JPM <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-614-million-in-mortgage-lending-settlement.php">settlement finalized</a> last week agreed to pay the US government $614 million and improve company mortgage lending practices for claims it approved thousands of unqualified home mortgage loans for government insurance since 2002 and cost the government millions of dollars when the loans defaulted. In November, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/doj-finalizes-13-billion-settlement-with-jpmorgan-for-toxic-mortgages.php">finalized</a> [JURIST report] a $13 billion civil settlement with JPMorgan that resolved federal and state claims arising from the bank's risky mortgage practices that helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. In August the company <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-attorneys-investigating-jpmorgan-for-violation-of-federal-securities-laws.php">disclosed</a> [JURIST report] in its quarterly filing with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] that it is being investigated by both the civil and criminal divisions of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/">Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California</a> (EDC) [official website] over sales of mortgage-backed securities to investors leading up to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. JPMorgan's disclosures came one day after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-sues-bank-of-america-for-fraud-relating-to-financial-crisis.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> (BOA) [corporate website], claiming the corporation misled investors about securitized loans worth more than $850 million. In an announcement earlier that week, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/August/13-ag-886.html">remarked</a> [press release] that the suit against BOA prove that the <a href="http://www.stopfraud.gov/">Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force</a> [official website] is taking an aggressive approach to uncovering abuses in the residential mortgage-backed securities market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The couple was legally married in California in 2013 and Jane Doe I is the legal mother of two boys, aged 12 and 15. On appeal from a magistrate ruling which denied the adoption, Jane Doe argued that Idaho's adoption statutes unambiguously allow her to adopt, that she meets all of the statutory requirements to adopt, and it is immaterial that she is considered unmarried under state law. <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title16/T16CH15SECT16-1501.htm">Idaho Code &#167; 16-1501</a> [text] provides that "[a]ny minor child may be adopted by any adult person residing in and having residence in Idaho, in the cases and subject to the rules prescribed in this chapter." Monday's ruling sets the precedent for second-parent adoption in Idaho and is not limited to same-sex couples. Rather, it affirms the law in Idaho that any state resident over 18 may adopt a child if the statutory requirements are met.

<p>The legal debate over <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most active legal issues in the US. In recent months, a number of states have faced challenges against the constitutionality of denying same-sex partners equal spousal rights. On Saturday, US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-privileges-to-extend-to-same-sex-couples.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the federal government plans to give married same-sex couples the same benefits as heterosexual couples when filing for bankruptcy, testifying in court, or visiting family members in prison. On Monday, four legally married same-sex couples in the state of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ohio-same-sex-couples-sue-to-list-both-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court, seeking a court order to force the state of Ohio to recognize both spouses' names on birth certificates. The tension between state and federal recognition of same-sex marriage rights is ongoing in the US state of Utah, which sits in the Tenth Circuit. Last week attorneys for the state of Utah <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/utah-state-attorneys-file-brief-in-same-sex-marriage-appeal.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], seeking to overturn a federal court decision that <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the ban on same-sex marriage in Utah. In January the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ALCU) [advocacy website], in conjunction with a private law firm, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-challenges-utahs-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of four same-sex couples in Utah. Earlier in January Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-same-sex-marriages-to-be-recognized-by-federal-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the federal government will recognize the marriages that took place in Utah while same-sex marriage was briefly allowed.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

On January 24 Masto's office <a href="http://ag.nv.gov/News/PR/2014/Miscellaneous/Attorney_General_Masto_Statement_on_Nevada%E2%80%99s_Same-Sex_Marriage_Case/">stated</a> [press release] its belief that the recent decision in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000692">SmithKline Beechum Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories</a> [materials] affected the viability of the state's equal protection and due process arguments, and that her office would coordinate with the governor's to decide how to proceed. The decision to abandon the defense was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/us-usa-nevada-gaymarriage-idUSBREA1A01F20140211">made</a> [Reuters report] with the support of Nevada's Republican governor and only removes the state as a party defending the ban. After concluding that the ban was no longer defensible in court, the state has filed a motion to redact a brief submitted to the Ninth Circuit in support of the ban. Masto also reportedly based her reversal on the Ninth Circuit's ruling that potential jurors in these cases cannot be dismissed due to their sexual orientation, further complicating the state's case. Nevada's same-sex marriage ban is enacted by an amendment to the state constitution and is being challenged by a group of eight same-sex couples alleging that the state's marriage ban and domestic partnership laws unfairly discriminate against them and effectively give them "second-class status."

<p>Controversy over same-sex marriage <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">continues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to be a prevalent legal issue in the US with some 33 states having bans on same-sex marriage and 17 permitting them. The state of Indiana is poised to become the next state banning gay marriage; the state's House of Representative on January 29 <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/indiana-house-approves-constitutional-amendment-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the constitution that would ban same-sex marriage by a 57-40 vote. In a move similar to his Nevada counterpart, the Virginia Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last month that his office would no longer be defending the state's ban, stating his belief that the law violated the equal protections required by the Fourteenth Amendment. Nevada has also been more aggressive towards same-sex couples than some of its compatriots. In April 2013 the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/aclu-challenges-nevada-law-criminalizing-samesex-intercourse-for-teens.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it would be challenging a Nevada law criminalizing consensual sexual intercourse between teenagers, with violations carrying potential penalties of up to five years in prison. The current Nevada law under which same-sex couples can enter into legal unions was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/nevada-legislature-passes-same-sex.php?edition=world">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after the legislature overrode a veto by the Governor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The memo, which cites the decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] that struck down Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text], states that the DOJ will recognize same-sex marriages as equally valid to heterosexual unions for all purposes of federal law. At a Human Rights Campaign gala event, <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-privileges-to-extend-to-same-sex-couples.php">Holder said</a> [JURIST report] the following about the policy change:<blockquote>This means that, in every courthouse, in every proceeding, and in every place where a member of the Department of Justice stands on behalf of the United States&#8212;they will strive to ensure that same-sex marriages receive the same privileges, protections, and rights as opposite-sex marriages under federal law.</blockquote>Notably, the memo states that the DOJ will not challenge the rights and privileges of lawful same-sex spouses on the grounds of residence in a state that does not recognize their marriage.

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community. Numerous challenges to same-sex marriage bans have arisen, particularly before federal courts in recent months. Four legally married Ohio same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ohio-same-sex-couples-sue-to-list-both-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] on Monday in the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] to have both parents' names listed on their children's birth certificates. In January, the Tulsa County Clerk's Office <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/oklahoma-officials-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">appealed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">district court ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that struck down <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/ok_constitution.html">Oklahoma's constitutional same-sex marriage ban</a> [text].

Orantes is a citizen of Canada, Guatemala, and formerly of the US; his status has been <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/02/10/suspected_guatemalan_war_criminal_jailed_10_years_for_lying_about_massacre.html">revoked</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report] as part of this decision. The current case refers only to Orantes' conviction for falsifying his naturalization forms. He has not yet been indicted or tried in US courts for war crimes. However, part of his conviction relied on findings by the jury that he had participated in the massacre and had permitted his subordinate soldiers to engage in rape and murder. Orantes has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/guatemalan-soldier-sentenced-lying-22437746">maintained</a> [AP report] his innocence and his lawyer reportedly stated that the trial was improperly conducted in the manner of a murder trial rather than a specific examination of the actual charges related to falsification of citizenship forms. Orantes was extradited from Canada to the US in 2011 to stand trial and he was convicted last year. Guatemalan authorities are seeking Orantes' extradition to stand trial for war crimes, and it is possible that he could be returned there after serving his prison sentence.

<p>Prosecutions relating to the 1982 village massacre are still ongoing though some perpetrators have been caught and convicted. Some of Orantes' compatriots facing charges in Guatemala have been <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/former-guatemala-soldier-sentenced-to-6060-years-in-prison-for-role-in-1982-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to more that 6,000 years in prison for their roles. The first Guatemalan war crimes trials related to the massacre <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-trial-over-guatemala-massacre-begins.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011. In April of that year Spain <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-court-seeks-extradition-of-guatemalan-massacre-suspect.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an international arrest warrant for Mr. Orantes related to his involvement in the massacre, at that time he was being held in Canada for falsifying his US citizenship forms and it was unclear whether he would be extradited to Spain or the United States. Orantes is also not the first individual suspected of involvement <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-judge-sentences-guatemala-peasant-massacre-suspect-to-10-years.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of lying on immigration forms, in 2010 another man was given an identical 10-year sentence for the same offense relating to involvement in the same massacre. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The compliance monitor was installed in October by Judge Cote of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], three months after she found Apple liable for conspiring with five publishers to raise e-book prices. Monday's ruling comes a month after Apple <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/apple-seeks-to-disqualify-compliance-monitor-in-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">sought to disqualify</a> [JURIST report] Bromwich, alleging the compliance monitor exceeded his mandate by demanding access to certain documents and questioning Apple executives on subjects outside of the anti-trust compliance program. The district court's order was upheld, requiring the monitor to assess the appropriateness of the anti-trust compliance programs adopted by Apple and the means used to communicate those programs to its personnel. The plaintiffs are seeking $840 million in damages, and a trial is scheduled for May.

<p>Apple is defending itself in a lawsuit over anti-trust violations <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/10/us-apple-ebooks-idUSBREA191YP20140210">brought</a> [Reuters report] by 33 state attorneys general and class action attorneys representing consumers from 16 states. In September Judge Cote <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-issues-injunction-against-apple-in-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">entered an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Apple preventing the company from future anti-trust violations in connection with e-book price fixing. The injunction forbids Apple from making any contractual relations with publishing companies that "restricts, limits, or impedes Apple's ability to set, alter, or reduce the Retail Price of any E-book." Last July Cote <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-finds-apple-guilty-of-e-book-price-fixing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Apple violated the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a> [text] and various state statutes in an e-book price-fixing conspiracy, and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] accused Apple of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthrw.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Tuesday released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/02/11/i-wanted-lie-down-and-die">report</a> [text] outlining the prevalent trafficking and torture of Eritrean refugees for ransom by Sudanese and Egyptian individuals that has been occurring since 2010. Victims stated in the report that traffickers kidnapped and tortured them in order to extort money from their relatives. Various methods of torture used by traffickers include sexual assault, beatings with metal rods, electric shocks and sleep deprivation. The victims further reported that Sudanese police had handed over Eritrean refugees to traffickers, and that Egyptian security personnel had also colluded with traffickers. Despite the number of trafficking and torture allegations, the Sudanese government had prosecuted only four police officers, while the Egyptian government had not prosecuted any security personnel, by the end of 2013. The report stated that governmental failure to properly prosecute traffickers breaches the countries' obligations under the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm">Convention Against Torture</a> [text], as well as international human rights law. Regarding the issues of trafficking and torture in the region, Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher for HRW stated, "Egyptian officials have for years denied the horrific abuse of refugees going on under their noses in Sinai. Both Egypt and Sudan need to put an end to torture and extortion of Eritreans on their territory, and to prosecute traffickers and any security officials colluding with them." HRW also stated that international donors to Egypt should request that the governments adequately investigate traffickers and security officials that may be colluding with them.

<p>Approximately 300,000 Eritrean refugees fled the country in 2012 alone, and the UN Refugee Agency <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=51407fc69&query=eritrea">estimates</a> [UNHCR report] that between two and three thousand people attempt to escape every month, though the journey is often life-threatening. In November UN Special Rapporteur Sheila Keetharuth <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-urges-eritrea-to-stop-human-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Eritrean government to respect its obligation to human rights, and called for protection for the hundreds of thousands of citizens currently fleeing the country for safety. Keetharuth also <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-international-community-to-aid-eritrea-refugees.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the international community in October to keep the Eritrean human rights situation in focus and to increase efforts to aid refugees. This call came in the wake of two incidents earlier in October, when <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13834&LangID=E">two separate boats</a> [OHCHR press release] full of African refugees, many of them from Eritrea, capsized in the Mediterranean, killing more than 350 refugees. In May Keetharuth warned that the current situation in Eritrea <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-increased-scrutiny-in-eritrea.php">warrants close scrutiny</a> [JURIST report] from the international community. In January HRW alleged that the Eritrean government's national service program requires all able-bodied men and women to serve indefinitely as conscripts for the government, and it assigns some of these conscripts to state-owned construction companies as <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-eritrea-mine-investors-risk-complicity-in-human-rights-violations.php">forced laborers</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The political atmosphere in Cambodia has been tense since last year's elections. In January the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] called for cooperation amongst all parties involved in escalating violence in Cambodia, demanding a release of detained union strikers and a <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-calls-for-calm-amidst-anti-government-riots-in-cambodia.php">government probe into anti-protest police tactics</a> [JURIST report].

Writing on behalf of a unanimous three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh stated that the IRS's statutory authority cannot be stretched so broadly as to encompass authority to regulate tax-return preparers. The new regulations, imposed in 2011 by the IRS, would have affected <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/02/11/irs-overreached-with-regulation-of-tax-return-preparers-appeals-court-rules/">hundreds of thousands</a> [WSJ report] of tax preparers.

<p>The IRS is no stranger to improper protocol and procedure. In May of last year the Justice Department <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/holder-orders-criminal-investigation-of-irs.php">opened a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that the IRS unfairly scrutinized tax-exemptions for conservative groups. The agency initially singled out groups with applications containing the names "Tea Party" or "Patriots," but expanded to target groups that promoted Constitutionalism. The misstep led to the issuance of an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/10/us-usa-politics-irs-idUSBRE9490S720130510">apology</a> [Reuters report] from the IRS, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/05/16/steven-millers-resignation-memo-to-irs-employees/">resignation</a> [Washington Post report] of Acting Commissioner Steven Miller, as well as comment from US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/13/remarks-president-obama-and-prime-minister-cameron-united-kingdom-joint-">calling</a> [press release] the IRS actions "outrageous." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that the detainees "failed to establish their entitlement to preliminary injunctive relief," as they did not meet the requirement of a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. However, the court reversed two district court decisions, which had determined that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] stripped federal courts of the necessary jurisdiction to consider challenges brought by Guantanamo Bay detainees. The circuit court held that "petitioners' challenges to the conditions of their confinement properly sound in habeas corpus and thus are not barred by the MCA." As a result, the detainees may return to the district court to challenge the practice of force-feeding. Regarding the ruling, Jon Eisenberg, the attorney representing the detainees, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/11/guantanamo-force-feeding_n_4767708.html">said</a> [AP report] they plan to continue their challenge.

<p>This is the latest development in Aamer's Guantanamo Bay detention. In September Aamer <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/guantanamo-detainee-files-complaint-against-uk-security-forces.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against UK security forces MI5 and MI6 with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, noting that although he has been cleared for release by both the US and the UK, Aamer is still being held at Guantanamo Bay. In July Aamer, along with three other Guantanamo Bay prisoners, filed the original <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/guantanamo-prisoners-ask-federal-court-to-order-end-to-force-feedings.php">motion</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to order prison officials to stop the practice of force-feeding hunger strikers. In December 2012 Aamer filed another <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/guantanamo-detainee-launches-defamation-suit-against-uk-agencies.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the British security forces calling for his release to be granted. Amnesty International (AI) has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-chides-prolonged-detention-of-uk-man-in-guantanamo.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] Aamer's detention at Guantanamo, calling it a "mockery of justice." In November 2010 AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-calls-for-release-of-last-uk-guantanamo-detainee.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US and the UK to work towards the release of Aamer. AI UK Director Kate Allen called on Hague and US officials to give a specific timetable for Aamer's release. The Hague and the US have been in discussions over Aamer's release, but no formal indications of a release have been made. The UK agrees that if Aamer is released, they will be wiling to accept him, as they did with former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">Binyam Mohammed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure passed after <a href="http://www.ltgov.virginia.gov/">Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam</a> [official website] <a href="http://wavy.com/2014/02/11/virginia-senate-votes-to-repeal-ultrasound-law/">cast his vote</a> [AP report] in favor of repeal, breaking a 20-20 tie. After casting his deciding vote Northam released the following statement:<blockquote>I've said time and time again that legislators&#8212; most of whom are men&#8212; have no business getting in between the healthcare decisions that a woman and her doctor make. As a practicing physician, I am hopeful that this mandate will ultimately be repealed. I will continue to work to ensure that when a woman has chosen to exercise her constitutional right to an abortion, she can go through that process without unnecessary hurdles that some legislators would seek to put in her way. Today's passage of SB 617 was a step in that direction, and I encourage the members of the House of Delegates to also pass this legislation.</blockquote>The passage of the Senate bill is expected to be largely symbolic as it moves to the Republican controlled House of Delegates.  

<p>The issue of pre-abortion ultrasound requirements in a number of states has drawn heavy criticism and legal action. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-north-carolina-abortion-ultrasound-law-is-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a North Carolina state law requiring women seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound procedure is unconstitutional because it violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment rights</a> [LII backgrounder] of physicians and patients. In November the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-oklahoma-abortion-ultrasound-case.php">denied certiorar</a>i [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/pruitt-v-nova-health-systems/">Pruitt v.

AI reports that anti-Muslim militias have engaged in large-scale, recurrent attacks on Muslim civilian communities in retaliation for the previous killing of Christian civilians by Muslim-led forces. In January the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-bans-travel-freezes-assets-of-central-african-republic-war-crimes-suspects.php">extended the mandate</a> [JURIST report] of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) and authorized the International Support Mission in the CAR (MISCA) and EU military personnel "to take all necessary measures," including the use of force, to maintain security and combat the "increasing cycle of violence and retaliation" resulting from continued sectarian conflict. AI asserts that, in order to protect the remaining Muslim communities, international peacekeeping forces must be given the authority to take "rapid steps" to gain control over the CAR's road network in order ensure that troops can be placed in strategic positions. In addition, AI urged the CAR's "transitional authorities" to restore security and the rule of law while continuing to "reconstitute basic government structures and institutions."

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital last March. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also, the UN reported last week that <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">more than 6,000 child soldiers may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier last month the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR. Also in December the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-authorizes-peacekeeping-in-central-african-republic.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to authorize the deployment of peacekeepers to CAR. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violence-in-the-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the continued violence between militias, rebels and government forces in CAR threatened to lead the country into renewed conflict.

Khan reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26150394">brought legal action</a> [BBC report] against the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] and the Pakistani government after a 2009 drone attack killed his son and brother. Sources indicate unidentified government forces abducted Khan from his home in Rawalpindi in early February, days before he was to testify against drone use before EU parliamentarians. Several advocacy groups in turn speculated that government intelligence agencies "disappeared" Khan to prevent his testimony. The court ordered the government to either produce Khan or disclose the legal basis upon which he was arrested.

<p>The growing use of unmanned aerial surveillance and combat capable aircraft, otherwise known as <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder], has drawn the attention of the world. In addition, drone use in Pakistan continues to be a contentious issue. In October Amnesty International (AI) urged the US to conduct a thorough, impartial and independent investigation into allegations that CIA drone strikes have <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/us-must-investigate-cia-drone-strikes-in-pakistan-ai.php">resulted in recent civilian casualties</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan.

In his remarks Inslee criticized the death penalty, stating the "system that falls short of equal justice under the law and makes it difficult for the State to justify the use of the death penalty." The governor noted that since the death penalty in its current form was put in place in Washington in 1981, 32 defendants have been sentenced to die, but 19 have had their sentences overturned, one man was set free and 18 have had their sentences converted to life in prison. Inslee stated "when the majority of death penalty sentences lead to reversal, the entire system itself must be called into question." In addition to voicing the belief the application of the death penalty is "inconsistent and unequal," the governor argued the high cost of prosecuting a capital offense at both the trial and appellate level makes life imprisonment without parole a more economical choice for the state.  

<p>The institution of the death penalty in the US has been under scrutiny recently due to questions over the particular lethal injection drugs used. Earlier this month Florida's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/florida-high-court-orders-a-review-of-new-lethal-injection-drug.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an evidentiary hearing to determine if the sedative midazolam should remain in the state's lethal injection procedure. Also in February a judge for the <a href="http://www.lamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website] declared that the scheduled execution of 70-year-old Christopher Sepulvado by lethal injection <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">will be delayed</a> for 90 days after the Louisiana Department of Corrections officials expanded their execution protocol to include a new two-drug mixture. The review of lethal injection procedures in a number of states stems from the prolonged <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of convicted murderer Dennis McGuire in January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.congreso.es/public_oficiales/L10/CONG/BOCG/B/BOCG-10-B-157-1.PDF">bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] includes a clause to halt current investigations, including the <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/spain-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-former-china-president.php">arrest warrants issued</a> [JURIST report] on Monday for several former Chinese leaders for their involvement in the alleged genocide in Tibet. The government announced plans for the universal jurisdiction reform after China expressed disapproval of the investigation and pressured the Spanish government to stop the prosecution. Under the bill, Spanish courts would be able to prosecute crimes against humanity committed abroad only if the suspect is a Spanish citizen, a foreigner residing in Spain or a foreigner whose extradition has been denied by Spain. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and other rights groups on Monday issued a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/NGO%20joint%20statement%20on%20UJ%20reform%20in%20Spain%2010-2-14.pdf">joint statement</a> [text, PDF] opposing universal jurisdiction reform in Spain, stating that the bill will "close the doors of Spanish courts to victims of grave human rights violations who are unlikely otherwise to be able to obtain justice, particularly within their own jurisdictions." The government is expected to write the bill into law in the coming weeks. 

<p>Spain has assertively used universal jurisdiction, creating political friction within the international community. In October, a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/china-denounces-spain-courts-indictment-of-former-president.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] former Chinese president Hu Jintao over the alleged genocide against Tibetans. Also in October, the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/us-ambassador-called-to-spain-regarding-spying-allegations.php">summoned</a> [JURIST report] US Ambassador to Spain James Costos to discuss spying allegations in light of documents released by former <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=edward+snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April 2011, the Spanish National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-court-turns-over-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-US.php">agreed to turn over</a> [JURIST report] to the US an investigation of torture claims at Guantanamo Bay, after increased pressure from the US. In 2009, the Spanish Congress <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limited the country's universal jurisdiction statute</a> [JURIST report]. Unlike the recent bill, the 2009 law only applied prospectively, allowing any on-going investigations to proceed, including investigations of <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/spain-court-to-investigate-israeli-role.php">Israeli actions in Gaza in 2002</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay</a> and allegations of war crimes and genocide in <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/spain-judge-indicts-40-rwanda-military.php">Rwanda</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/spain-high-court-to-rule-on-tibetan.php">Tibet</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/spain-court-to-try-guatemala-genocide.php">Guatemala</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/spain-court-to-hear-suit-against-china.php">China</a> [JURIST reports]</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26150585">cited insufficient grounds</a> [BBC report] for either claim brought by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's ruling <a href="http://www.ptp.or.th/landding.html">Pheu Thai Party</a> [party website, in Thai] or the opposition <a href="http://www.democrat.or.th/">Democrat Party</a> [party website, in Thai]. The Democrat Party argued that the poll violated the country's constitution for several reasons, including that it was not completed in one day. The opposition party's <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-opposition-party-petitions-court-to-annul-election.php">petition</a> [JURIST report] also sought the dissolution of the ruling party and to ban party executives from holding political office for five years. The Pheu Thai Party dismissed the argument as circular, and blamed the delay on opposition demonstrations that blocked polling stations. The court found that the demonstrations were legal under the constitutional right to protest, and that any actions against the opposition party should be taken under relevant criminal law statutes.  

<p>Thailand has been fraught with political instability since the <a href="/forum/2006/09/disillusioned-with-democracy-tale-of.php">2006 military coup</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In the days leading up to the elections an anti-government protest leader was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] during demonstrations blocking a voting station. The shooting came just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency, granting it broad powers to curtail the political unrest, including the ability to censor media, impose a curfew and detain suspects without charges. These powers are in addition to those granted in November when the prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-prime-minister-invokes-special-security-law-amidst-protests.php">invoked</a> [JURIST report] a special security law known as the Internal Security Act, which conferred broader powers on police forces attempting to contain the protests. Just days later protesters <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-protesters-seek-help-overthrowing-government.php?edition=full">stormed</a> [JURIST report] the army's headquarters in Bangkok, seeking assistance in overthrowing the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php">initially approved in 2010</a> [JURIST report], but its implementation was delayed during a federal lawsuit over the law's constitutionality. Last year a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-appeals-court-approves-denying-housing-to-illegal-immigrants.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional because it does not impermissibly remove a class of aliens from the city or intrude on federal immigration and anti-harboring laws. The law is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304104504579377804255533452">expected to be challenged to the US Supreme Court</a> [WSJ report]. 

<p>The approval of the Nebraska ordinance is the latest development in an ongoing battle over <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/detail.php">immigration enforcement</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that began with Arizona's enactment of <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">SB 1070</a> [JURIST report], which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">partially struck down by the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report]. In December New Jersey Governor Cris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a controversial immigration bill that allows undocumented students to attend state colleges at in-state tuition rates. In April Oregon's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/oregon-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] similar bill enabling undocumented students to attend public universities in the state at the same tuition rate as in-state residents. Last March a federal judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">blocked enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime. In January 2013 Alabama's Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/alabama-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asked the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to overturn a decision by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] striking down provisions of the state's controversial immigration law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/north-carolina-to-appeal-ruling-against-choose-life-license-plates.php">appealed</a> to the Fourth Circuit after a federal district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] the law. The Fourth Circuit held that North Carolina violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment of the US Constitution</a> [Cornell LLI backgrounder] by permitting the "choose life" license plate while refusing pro-life specialty plates. The court stated that this constitutes "blatant viewpoint discrimination squarely at odds with the First Amendment." Scott Gaylord of Elon University School of Law <a href="/forum/2011/12/scott-gaylord-government-speech.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the government speech doctrine outlined in two recent US Supreme Court decisions permits North Carolina to speak for itself through the "choose life" license plate and thus viewpoint neutrality principles are not applicable. However, the Fourth Circuit addressed this issue in its decision and determined that a specialty license plate constitutes private speech on government property and therefore implicates viewpoint neutrality. Chris Brook of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], who argued the case before the Fourth Circuit, applauded Tuesday's ruling and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/protecting-civil-liberties-digital-age/federal-appeals-court-rules-north-carolinas-one-sided-license">stated</a> [press release] that his organization would have taken the same position if the state issued a pro-choice license plate while prohibiting a pro-life one.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">Abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a particularly controversial issue in North Carolina in recent years. Last month a federal judge in North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-north-carolina-abortion-ultrasound-law-is-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's abortion ultrasound law is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The law in question, the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">Woman's Right to Know Act</a> [HB 854 materials] called for a 24-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion and required women to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] by former North Carolina governor Beverly Perdue in June 2011.

The case was brought by four same-sex couples living in Kentucky, who had been legally married in Canada or other US states prior to moving to Kentucky. Judge John Heyburn II held that by denying recognition of valid same-sex marriages, Kentucky is in violation of the US Constitution's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Heyburn further stated that the laws of Kentucky "treat gay and lesbian persons differently in a way that demeans them." Heyburn recognized that his decision will likely be unpopular among Kentucky residents, as 74 percent of voters <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kentucky-must-recognize-gay-marriages-from-other-states-federal-judge-rules/2014/02/12/8ec79508-9410-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html">approved a constitutional amendment</a> [WP report] banning gay marriage in 2004. 

<p>Controversy over <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues in the US, with 33 states having bans on the practice and 17 permitting it. On Monday US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/doj-extends-benefits-to-all-same-sex-marriages.php">issued a policy memorandum</a> [JURIST report] stating that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will recognize and extend benefits to all same-sex marriages, including those performed in states that do not recognize them. Also on Monday Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that her office would no longer be pursuing its legal defense of the state's same-sex marriage ban, stating that recent decisions in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had rendered the state's arguments untenable. On the same day, the Idaho Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/idaho-top-court-grants-adoptive-rights-to-same-sex-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that a woman in a same-sex marriage may adopt her partner's birth children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mendez was encouraged by Tajikistan's response to his last visit and recommendations he had given to the government in 2012, and especially welcomed the country's adoption of a National Action Plan, legal awareness campaigns and a new institute of forensic medicine. He also stated, however, that punishment for those engaging in severe torture and ill-treatment must be increased and that legislation must prohibit amnesty for this class of crimes. Mendez was concerned by the fact that, although allegations of torture and ill-treatment have been prevalent during the past two years regarding the country's apprehension, interrogation and detention processes, only four cases have been prosecuted during this time period. Additionally, Mendez expressed concern about the country's persistent denial of timely access to independent legal counsel for individuals. Mendez ultimately recommended that the Tajikistan government ratify the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPCAT.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture</a> [text] and stated that the country's legislation "should be amended to ensure that the obligation not to extradite or deport or expel a person to a country where he or she faces a risk of torture or ill-treatment is duly recognized and that appropriate legal recourse is guaranteed in order to allow for a meaningful risk assessment." Mendez will submit a detailed report to the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website], regarding his observations and further recommendations for the Tajikistan government. 

<p>Despite attempts by the UN and various advocacy groups to eradicate torture among the international community, it still remains a constant and unyielding problem in a number of countries. On Tuesday Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-report-traffickers-torturing-eritreans-in-sudan-and-egypt.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] outlining the prevalent trafficking and torture of Eritrean refugees for ransom by Sudanese and Egyptian individuals that has been occurring since 2010. In January the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters, which have since been offered amnesty. In December lawyers for two Guantanamo detainees, arguing before the European Court of Human Rights, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/guantanamo-detainees-accuse-poland-in-cia-rendition-torture.php">accused Poland</a> [JURIST report] of serving as a secret torture site for the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive]. In November an independent report supported by the Institute on Medicine as a Profession and the Open Society Foundations reported that doctors and psychologists working in US military detention centers <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/report-us-medical-professionals-participated-in-detainee-torture.php">helped to design</a> [JURIST report] methods of torture for terrorism suspects. The report examined various charges that the Department of Defense (DOD) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) "improperly demanded that US military and intelligence agency health professionals collaborate in intelligence gathering and security practices in a way that inflicted severe harm on detainees in US custody."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, Missouri's <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/const/a01033.htm">Constitutional Amendment 2</a> [text], approved by Missouri voters in 2004, states "[t]hat to be valid and recognized in this state, a marriage shall exist only between a man and a woman." The lawsuit includes couples who have been together for over 30 years, couples who have children or wish to adopt, and couples with concerns about health and job related benefits. The executive director of ACLU Missouri <a href="https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-lawsuit-seeks-recognition-missouri-same-sex-couples-legally-married-out-state">said</a> [press release], "Because of the many benefits of marriage, Missouri has traditionally recognized lawful marriages performed in other states" and pointed out that the current laws are harmful to legally married same-sex couples. The lawsuit does not attempt to repeal Missouri's ban on same-sex marriage performed within the state, just gain marital recognition for marriages from other states.

<p>The legal debates surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are some of the most active legal <a href="/forum/2014/02/james-dwyer-virginia-marriage.php">controversies</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the US. The Idaho Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/idaho-top-court-grants-adoptive-rights-to-same-sex-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously on Monday that a woman in a same-sex marriage may adopt her partner's birth children.

On Saturday, US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-privileges-to-extend-to-same-sex-couples.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the federal government plans to give married same-sex couples the same benefits as heterosexual couples when filing for bankruptcy, testifying in court, or visiting family members in prison. Last week, four legally married same-sex couples in the state of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ohio-same-sex-couples-sue-to-list-both-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court, seeking a court order to force the state of Ohio to recognize both spouses' names on birth certificates. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The constitutional court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/12/us-italy-drugs-law-idUSBREA1B1FF20140212">declared the law illegitimate</a> [Reuters report] without further elaboration. The cannabis law was blamed for causing Italian prison overcrowding, and an estimated 10,000 people may be released from jail with its repeal. The law had deemed marijuana and hashish the legal equivalent to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, which increased sentences from 2-6 years to 6-20 years. Now that the law has been struck down, the prior law with shorter cannabis-related sentences will take effect. Neither law created a criminal offense for consumption, just possession.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">Marijuana legalization</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has created controversy in the US and abroad. JURIST Guest Columnist Alex Kriet predicts that 2014 will be a <a href="/forum/2013/11/alex-kreit-marijuana-legalization.php">groundbreaking year for marijuana policy</a>, and JURIST Guest Columnist Reid Murdoch argues that as regulated cannabis markets open, institutions will <a href="/dateline/2014/02/reid-murdoch-marijuana-legalization.php">adapt to the change</a> [JURIST op-eds].

<a href="http://www.med.uscourts.gov/">The United States District Court of Maine</a> [official website] ruled on Wednesday that a city ordinance banning people from panhandling in median strips of streets was unconstitutional. <a href="http://www.med.uscourts.gov/court-history#Judges">US District Judge George Singal</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/12/us-usa-panhandling-maine-idUSBREA1B29020140212">found</a> [Reuters report] that the Portland, Maine <a href="http://www.portlandmaine.gov/citycode.htm">ordinance's</a> [city code] distinction between allowing people to be in the medians to place political campaign signs, and disallowing people to loiter in the medians was a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment right</a> [LII backgrounder] to freedom of speech. The <a href="http://www.aclumaine.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Maine</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] challenged the ordinance, arguing that the First Amendment protects all citizens equally, regardless of wealth. The ACLU also argued that the motive behind the ordinance passed in August, was not safety, but rather the protection small businesses in the area. City officials argued that the increase in panhandlers in 2012 and 2013 created a safety hazard for motorists. 

<p>In June the ACLU filed a <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/aclu-misc-13-02.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [official website] for the review of of FISC opinions to identify which are subject to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/free-speech-national-security-technology-and-liberty/reform-patriot-act-section-215">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [ACLU backgrounder] disclosure.

The Sri Lankan government and the rebel <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1869501,00.html">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (Tamil Tigers) [Time backgrounder] have both <a href="http://www.startribune.com/world/245356421.html">been accused</a> [AP report] of war crimes and human rights violations, primarily in the final months of the conflict. According to the AP, the government has been accused of deliberately shelling civilians, blocking food and medicine for civilians trapped in the war zone and deliberately undercounting civilians caught up in fighting. The Tamil rebels have been accused of using civilians as human shields, killing those who tried to escape their hold and recruiting child soldiers. According to a November 2012 UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/The_Internal_Review_Panel_report_on_Sri_Lanka.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final months of the conflict. 

<p>The UNP's demands come amid mounting pressure on the Sri Lankan government from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/world/asia/new-inquiry-on-sri-lanka-points-to-possible-war-crimes.html?_r=1">human rights groups and the international community</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] to investigate and prosecute abuses during the conflict. Last week The <a href="http://www.piac.asn.au/frontpage">Public Interest Advocacy Center</a> (PIAC) [advocacy website], an Australian nonprofit legal advocacy group, <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/investigation-reveals-possible-war-crimes-in-sri-lanka.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing possible war crimes and crimes against humanity during the final months of the civil war. The reports findings will be incorporated into an upcoming meeting of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] sponsored by the US. Last month US ambassador <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/129455.htm">Stephen Rapp</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to investigate rights abuses by security forces during the civil war. In November UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/britain-pm-demands-independent-sri-lanka-rights-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the Sri Lankan government conduct its own investigation into war crime allegations. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sri-lanka-must-improve-human-rights-record-un-rights-chief.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to improve its human rights record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1265&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Judge Terence Kern</a> [official profile] for the <a href="http://www.oknd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] issued a temporary restraining order on <a href="http://www.apothecarytulsa.com/index.asp">The Apothecary Shoppe in Tulsa</a> [corporate website] to stop the pharmacy from providing an execution drug to the <a href="http://doc.mo.gov/">Missouri Department of Corrections</a> [official website] for an upcoming lethal injection. The restraining order was <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2014/02/12/company-blocked-from-selling-execution-drug-to-mo">issued</a> [AP report] after a federal lawsuit was filed by Michael Taylor, who is scheduled to be executed later this month. The lawsuit argued that several recent executions using pentobarbital indicate that Taylor would experience inhumane pain during his execution. Judge Kern agreed with this possibility and set a hearing for Tuesday. The judge also ordered the pharmacy submit a response to the lawsuit. Taylor pleaded guilty to abducting, raping and killing a 15-year-old girl in 1989. 

<p>There is a shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs in the US, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols. Last week a federal judge in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] a trial to review the constitutionality of the state's new execution protocol, which delayed the prisoner's execution for 90 days. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain and his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The class action complaint seeks a declaration that the Mass Association Tracking Program (MATP) violates the<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment"> Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution</a> [text], an injunction forbidding the government from continuing the program and an order to the defendants to purge the telephone metadata of the plaintiffs and class members from its MATP databases. Metadata, records that show that calls took place but exclude the content of the calls, is not protected by the Fourth Amendment, according to a 1979 Supreme Court ruling. The Obama administration has defended the MATP as lawful, pointing to the authorization of the program for 90-day intervals by 15 judges on the <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> [official website] in 2006, and Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesperson, expressed confidence in the legality of the program. 

<p>The revelations surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">NSA surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Earlier this month current and former US officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nsa-now-collecting-less-than-30-percent-of-us-phone-records.php">released </a>[JURIST report] a report stating that less than 30 percent of all American's phone records due to the inability to keep up with the increased use of cellular phones. In late January the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]<a href="/paperchase/2014/01/aclu-terror-suspect-challenge-constitutionality-of-nsa-surveillence-program.php"> filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of terror suspect Jamshid Muhtorov to suppress evidence the NSA obtained from surveillance conducted pursuant to the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/laws/pl110261.pdf">FISA Amendments Act of 2008</a> (FAA) [text, PDF]. Also last month the<a href="http://www.pclob.gov/"> Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board </a>(PCLOB) [official website], an independent agency created by Congress to protect American privacy under anti-terrorism laws, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-privacy-board-finds-nsa-phone-program-illegal.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] calling the NSA's metadata program illegal and saying that it should be ended. Earlier in January President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-pledges-an-end-to-nsas-mass-collection-practices.php">announced detailed plans</a> [JURIST report] to change surveillance policy, curbing the abilities of intelligence agencies to collect and use American phone data.

The Louisiana Constitution as amended in 2004 defines marriage as "only of the union of one man and one woman," and states that "No official or court of the state of Louisiana shall recognize any marriage contracted in any other jurisdiction which is not the union of one man and one woman. Two of the couples filing the lawsuit <a href="http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/national/south/2014/02/4_gay_couples_challenge_la_gay_marriage_ban">cited</a> [AP report] concerns regarding Louisiana's failure to recognize both members of a same-sex union as parents regardless of whether the child is adopted or born to the union, as the impetus for joining the lawsuit. The lawsuit also challenges a state revenue department policy that has forced married same-sex couples who file joint federal tax returns to file separate "single" state tax returns in the state, allegedly violating their First Amendment right to free speech. The case is <a href="http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/02/gay_rights_group_files_lawsuit.html">scheduled to be heard</a> [<em>New Orleans Times-Picayune</em> report] in the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] by Judge Martin Feldman.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a contentious issue in the US. Earlier this week a judge for the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-must-recognize-same-sex-marriages-performed-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Kentucky must recognize valid out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples living in Kentucky. The case was brought by four same-sex couples living in Kentucky, who had been legally married in Canada or other US states. On Monday US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/doj-extends-benefits-to-all-same-sex-marriages.php">issued a policy memorandum</a> [JURIST report] stating that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will recognize and extend benefits to all same-sex marriages, including those performed in states that do not recognize them. Also on Monday <a href="http://ag.nv.gov/">Nevada Attorney General</a> [official website] Catherine Cortez Masto <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that her office would no longer be pursuing its legal defense of the state's same-sex marriage ban, stating that recent decisions in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had rendered the state's arguments untenable. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeals chamber found errors in the trial chamber's assessment of the evidence relating to Ndindiliyimana's conviction, which was based on his superior responsibility over certain participants in attacks. The appeals chamber also found errors of law and fact that led to them to conclude that Nzuwonemeye could not be held responsible for the killing of the prime minister.

<p>Many countries have attempted to assist the ICTR in locating and bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. Earlier this month a French court<a href="/paperchase/2014/02/france-court-opens-countrys-first-rwanda-genocide-trial.php"> opened trial</a> [JURIST report] against former Rwandan intelligence chief Pascal Simbikangwa in the country's first trial of a suspect related to the genocide. In January UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association Maina Kiai <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-expert-praises-strides-in-rwanda-urges-protection-assembly-rights.php">praised </a> [JURIST report] Rwandan authorities' accomplishments in developing infrastructure and ensuring stability and security 1994. In November a French appeals court in Paris <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Claude Muhayimana and Innocent Musabyimana, two suspects wanted in connection with the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In April<a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php"> French law enforcement officials arrested</a> [JURIST report] Tite Barahira, a former Rwandan leader, for conspiracy to commit genocide. In January Rwandan genocide suspect Innocent Musabyimana was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested </a>[JURIST report] in France on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In December the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison and concluding the tribunal's final trial. Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.

On January 23 HRW interviewed Gaddafi, who revealed that he and the other detainees have been denied access to legal counsel. Moreover, he claimed they were not afforded an opportunity to review the evidence submitted against them in relation to crimes they allegedly committed during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Following the interview, HRW deputy director Nadim Houry criticized the Libyan government, stating, "The Libyan government should make greater efforts to ensure these detained former officials have adequate legal counsel and the opportunity to defend themselves fairly before a judge." Under the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1444332.pdf">Libyan Code of Criminal Procedure</a> (CCP) [text, PDF], if a case is remitted to trial, and a defendant has not elected a lawyer, the chamber must appoint one. During the interview, Gaddafi confirmed that he was not present for any of the pretrial sessions but said he knew of some criminal charges against him. Gaddafi and other detainees stated that their lawyers had no access to court documents, witness statements, or the evidence against them. Gaddafi has yet to appear before a judge.

<p>Gaddafi and former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi have also faced charges of crimes against humanity before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. In October the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1663102.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] that the case against al-Senussi is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr953.aspx">inadmissible before the ICC</a> [press release] and can only be heard by domestic courts in Libya, but noted that the decision did not affect the issue with regards to the charges against Gaddafi. The ICC's decision marked the most recent development in a <a href="/hotline/2012/05/leila-hanafi-libya-ICC.php">legal battle between Libya and the ICC</a> [JURIST op-ed] regarding al-Senussi and Gaddafi. The two men were also <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/libya-prosecutors-to-try-gaddafi-son-spy-chief-for-murder.php">charged with murder</a> [JURIST report] by Lybian prosecutors in August. A month earlier, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-orders-libya-to-turn-over-gaddafis-son.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the country's request to suspend an order to hand over al-Islam Gaddafi to face the international charges. In June Gaddafi's lawyer <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/lawyer-for-gaddafi-son-accuses-libya-of-defying-icc.php">accused Libyan officials</a> [JURIST report] of defying the ICC by announcing that his domestic trial would begin in August despite the ICC's attempts to have him extradited. The order <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">demanding Libya to extradite al-Senussi</a> [JURIST report] to face charges of crimes against humanity was made by the ICC in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The rule required concealed weapons applicants to show good cause to receive a permit to carry a concealed weapon, be of "good moral character," and complete a training course. In order to establish good cause, supporting documents such as restraining orders or letters from law enforcement agencies could be used to determine whether the applicant could show a sufficiently pressing need for self-protection. Plaintiffs Edward Peruta, Michelle Laxson, James Dodd, Leslie Buncher and Mark Cleary wished to carry handguns for self-defense but were unable to provide supporting documents. The plaintiffs sued San Diego County, alleging that the rule infringed upon their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] right to bear arms. Using the historical and plain-meaning interpretation of the constitutional language, the court <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140213/california-ban-on-concealed-weapons-overturned-by-9th-circuit-appeals-court">ruled</a> [AP report] that if the right to bear arms were restricted to the home, the constitutional significance of the right would not be achieved.

<p>The Second Amendment and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] remain controversial issues in the US. Last year the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/clerk/opinions.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/tenth-circuit-finds-no-second-amendment-right-to-concealed-weapons.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that permits to carry concealed weapons are not protected by the Second Amendment. On the same day the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-appeals-court-rejects-illinois-request-to-reconsider-concealed-guns-ruling.php">refused to reconsider</a> a ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-us-court-of-1.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Illinois' ban on carrying concealed weapons. In January 2013 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive actions</a> [JURIST report] and called on Congress to pass stricter gun-control laws. In November 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-new-york-concealed-carry-law.php">held</a> [JURIST reports] that New York can continue to require residents who seek to carry a concealed weapon to obtain a special license.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Another part of the group is facing trial for attempted murder, illegal protests and acquisition of firearms for protests northeast of Cairo.

<p>Trials against Morsi supporters continue as the Egyptian government attempts to re-stabilize.

Muigai noted specifically that his office was in no way to obstruct the ICC investigation and was merely following articles 91, 93, and 96 of the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [text], which requires requests for information to comply with national laws. Specifically, Muigai argued that:<blockquote>Article 96 deals with contents of request for other forms of assistance under Article 93 and provides that among other things, a request shall contain or be supported by such information as may be required under the law of the requested State in order to execute the request and that upon request of the Court, a State party shall consult with the court either generally or with respect to a specific matter, regarding any requirement under its national law that may apply and that during the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirement of its national law.</blockquote>Because Kenya's Central Bank is made entirely independent by the nation's <a href="http://www.kenyaembassy.com/pdfs/The%20Constitution%20of%20Kenya.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF], the proper procedure for releasing bank records would be to go through the Kenyan court system. Supporters of the ICC argue that this is tantamount to obstruction because the ICC prosecutor is tasked with asking for cooperation in investigations from states party and is not equipped to seek out national lawsuits. However, the Kenyan government continues to claim it is cooperating and is simply bound by current law.

<p>The trial of Kenyan authorities continues to be controversial, especially in relation to Kenyatta. Earlier this month, ICC prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/icc-prosecutors-request-indefinite-delay-in-trial-of-kenya-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] an indefinite delay in the trial. Also in February the African Union called for African countries to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/african-union-urges-members-to-stand-against-icc-trials-of-presidents.php">"speak with one voice" against the trials</a> [JURIST report] of sitting heads of state of Kenya in the ICC. In January the Trial Chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/icc-grants-kenya-leaders-request-to-skip-parts-of-pending-trial.php">made an oral ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Vice President William Ruto may be conditionally excused from attending his trial on a continuous basis. In November the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/icc-reverses-ruling-excusing-kenya-president-from-continuous-presence-at-trial.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a previous decision that Kenyatta could be excused from parts of his crimes against humanity trial. In the initial ruling, the Trial Chamber stated that the excuse was "strictly granted to accommodate the demanding functions of his office as President of Kenya." Kenyatta and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Samoei Ruto</a> [ICC case materials] are facing trial for crimes against humanity for their alleged involvement in inciting the violence that followed the 2007 Kenyan election which led to more than 1,100 deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.justiz.bayern.de/englisch.php">Bavarian justice minister</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.winfried-bausback.de/">Winfried Bausback</a> [official profile, in German] presented a bill on Friday to the <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/index.jsp">German Parliament</a> [official website, in German] that would lift the statute of limitations for certain cases involving stolen property. The law would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/world/europe/germany-considers-lifting-statute-of-limitations-on-cases-involving-stolen-art.html?_r=0">help</a>  [<em>NYT</em> report] Jewish families seeking the return of stolen art and other valuables from Nazis. Under the current German civil code, citizens may not bring claims concerning stolen property after 30 years. This means for property stolen during World War II, the statute of limitations ended in 1975. Critics say that the law still presents obstacles for the Jewish families seeking to recover property because they must still prove that the property was stolen with malicious intent. Bausback proposed the new law after Cornelius Gurlitt was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html">found</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] in 2012 with 1,500 works of art that were formerly confiscated by the Nazis.

The case had been dismissed for inadequate pleading in the lower court. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded some, but not all of their claims. The complaint stems from a 2006 oil spill in which roughly 200,000 gallons of oil were leaked from Alaskan pipelines, and another spill that occurred only five months later. The shareholders' claim alleges that BP knowingly or with deliberate recklessness made false and misleading statements regarding the corrosion rate of their pipelines and about their "world-class corrosion monitoring and leak-detection systems." The Court held that plaintiffs had adequately pleaded scienter regarding the first statement, but had failed to meet that burden on the second, requiring dismissal of that claim. BP Alaska has already <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/us-bp-spill-ruling-idUSBREA1C1RE20140213">pleaded guilty</a> [Reuters report] to a misdemeanor regarding the spill and paid over $20 million in state and federal penalties. 

<p>Alaska <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/alaska-seeking-civil-penalties-for-bp.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] BP in 2007 for claims relating to the 2006 spill. Alaska requested compensation for direct environmental damage to state land and for the loss of significant state revenue, since a large portion of Alaskan tax money comes from oil companies and BP was forced to shut down regional production after the second 2006 spill. That announcement came days after BP pleaded guilty to having <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/bp-subsidiary-pleads-guilty-to-clean.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> [text, PDF] in what was at that time the largest oil spill in Alaskan history. The EPA <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/bp-faces-epa-criminal-probe-into.php">began</a> [JURIST report] a criminal investigation into BP's conduct related to the spill in April 2006, less than a month after the first spill</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/123213">urged</a> [press release] the Somali government on Thursday to adopt reforms to help prevent sexual violence against women and provide support for victims. HRW released a report, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/02/13/here-rape-normal-0">"Here, Rape is Normal" </a> [HRW report], with instructions for the government to establish a strategy to reduce sexual violence in the country. The report lays out five steps for the Somali government: improve prevention strategies, improve access to emergency health services, ensure access to justice, legal and policy reforms, and ensure women's social and political equality. HRW also details the abuse happening in the country, stating, "Armed assailants, including members of state security forces, have sexually assaulted, raped, shot, and stabbed numerous women and girls." According to the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs </a>(OCHA) [official website], there were at least 800 <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/html/story.asp?NewsID=45641&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=#.Uv5EnF7VhXY">cases of sexual and gender-based violence</a> [UN report] reported in the capital, Mogadishu. HRW believes the number to be much higher, given that the women they interviewed did not report rapes because they were so commonplace in the country. 

<p>Sexual violence has been an ongoing issue in Somalia. In March HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/displaced-people-in-somalia-face-abuse-and-rape-hrw.php">displaced people in Somalia face the risk of physical abuse and rape</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government. That ruling followed the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-urges-somalia-to-reopen-case-against-alleged-rape-victim-journalist.php">recommendation</a> [JURIST report] of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] to reopen the case. Last February Somalia's new prime minister, Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid, said that the Somali authorities would become more involved in <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/somalia-pm-promises-to-increase-protection-to-rape-victims-journalists.php">protecting rape victims</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was originally brought by Simona Longoria, mother of Thomas Araguz, and subsequently joined by his first wife, against Nikki, seeking nullification of the marriage. The Texas district court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-revives-transgender-widows-legal-fight-22506775">ruled</a> [AP report] in 2011 that the marriage was "void as a matter of law." The appeals court remanded the case on the grounds that there was a genuine issue of material fact with regards to Nikki's sex and whether her marriage was a same-sex one. Longoria claimed that Thomas only learned of his wife's gender history just prior to his death and had planned to end the marriage. Nikki instead claims that her husband had fully supported her transition. Nikki underwent gender reassignment surgery two months after the couple's marriage in 2008. The court found that further expert testimony regarding Nikki's sex was needed, and that 2009 changes to the Texas Family Codes had invalidated earlier court precedent on the matter.

<p>The rights and identity of transgendered individuals is a topic of debate in many states and countries, with supporters claiming that gender is not necessarily tied to the sex organs one is born with, while others <a href="/hotline/2013/12/dean-broyles-bathroom-bill.php">asserting</a> [JURIST op-ed] that "sex is an objective, biological fact." In January the Supreme Court of Maine ruled that a school district had violated the rights of a transgender student when it tried to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/maine-high-court-rules-school-violated-transgender-student-rights.php">prevent</a> [JURIST report] her from using the girl's bathroom. In November the group Privacy for all Students <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/opponents-of-california-transgender-law-petition-for-repeal.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] it had obtained enough signatures to put an initiative on the November 2014 ballot to repeal the California law allowing school students to self-identify with a particular gender and to use the corresponding school facilities. In 2012 Alaska <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/alaska-to-allow-transgender-individuals-to-change-gender-marker-on-drivers-licenses.php">began</a> [JURIST report] to allow transgendered individuals to begin changing their gender markers on their driver's license to more accurately reflect their gender. Just months earlier the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-hormone-therapy-for-transgender-inmates.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] certiorari to decide the issue of whether transgendered prison inmates have a right to hormone therapy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hard married David Fancher in Massachusetts in 2011, and Fancher <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-challenges-alabama-s-unconstitutional-marriage-protection-act-and-sanctity-of">died in Alabama</a> [SPLC press release] three months later following a car accident. A wrongful death lawsuit was filed, but Fancher's <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/filed_complaint_-_ex_b.pdf">death certificate</a> [text, PDF] states that he was never married and does not indicate a surviving spouse in accordance with Alabama law. As a result, Hard cannot be the beneficiary of proceeds that may be awarded despite being the sole beneficiary in Fancher's will. In the complaint, SPLC argues:<blockquote>The United States Supreme Court recently held that the U.S. Constitution does not permit laws that single out a particular class of marriages for disfavored treatment. But that is precisely what the Sanctity Laws do: they single out same-sex marriages and deny to those marriages the same rights and dignity that Alabama affords other marriages. In doing so, the Sanctity Laws violate the right to equal protection and due process, as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</blockquote>The lawsuit was filed in December, but defendants were notified this week.

<p>The legal debates surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are some of the most active legal <a href="/forum/2014/02/james-dwyer-virginia-marriage.php">controversies</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the US. Several challenges to state laws have been filed following the Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruling last year</a> [JURIST report] that the federal government cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages or deny same sex couples benefits. This week a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-must-recognize-same-sex-marriages-performed-out-of-state.php">federal judge ruled</a> Kentucky must recognize out-of-state same sex marriages, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-missouri-ban-on-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">lawsuit</a> challenging Missouri's ban recognizing out-of-state same sex marriages after filing a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/aclu-files-suit-challenging-wisconsin-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] last week challenging Wisconsin's ban. Last month the Ohio Attorney General announced he <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-ag-plans-to-appeal-ruling-requiring-state-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage.php">would appeal</a> a Sixth Circuit decision requiring Ohio to recognize same sex marriages and Utah's governor directed his cabinet to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/utah-governor-directs-cabinet-not-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">put on hold</a> [JURIST reports] any recognition of same sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontbelgiumgovernment.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The lower house of <a href="http://www.fed-parl.be/index.html">Belgian Parliament</a> [official website] gave final approval on Thursday to a bill that would extend the country's euthanasia law to certain cases of terminally ill minors. The <a href="http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=|flwb&language=nl&cfm=flwb.cfm?lang=F&dossierID=3245">legislation</a> [materials, in Dutch], approved by a vote of 86 to 44 with 12 abstentions, would extend a 2002 <a href="http://www.ethical-perspectives.be/viewpic.php?LAN=E&TABLE=EP&ID=59">law</a> [text, PDF] that allows euthanasia for terminally ill adults to minors with "constant and unbearable physical suffering" and equipped "with a capacity of discernment." Specifically, the law requires that the patient be legally competent and conscious at the time of the request for euthanasia, that the request is voluntary and that the patient is in a "medically futile condition of constant and unbearable physical pain or mental suffering that can not be alleviated, resulting from a serious and incurable disorder caused by illness or accident." Consent from parents or guardians will also be required. Although the bill is widely supported, opponents stress that modern medicine can alleviate suffering among most, and that euthanasia of minors can lead Belgium down a questionable ethical path. The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/belgium-senate-votes-to-extend-euthanasia-law-to-terminally-ill-minors.php">approved by the Senate</a> in December and <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/belgium-approves-bill-allowing-minors-to-request-euthanasia.php">by a Senate committee</a> [JURIST reports] in November. The bill now goes before <a href="http://www.monarchie.be/royal-family/king-philippe">King Philippe</a> [official website], who is expected to sign it into law within the week. If Philippe signs, Belgium will become the first country in the world to eliminate the age limit requirement for euthanasia.

<p>Euthanasia laws have seen varying approval around the world in recent years. The Netherlands legalized euthanasia in 2001, and Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/belgium-euthanasia-cases-double-since.php">followed suit</a> [JURIST report] in 2002. Accordingly, statistics show that in 2005, euthanasia cases in Belgium had nearly doubled what they were when the legislation passed, with almost 400 instances reported. In 2006 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], making Oregon the only US state that allows assisted suicide. In 2007 the <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/swiss-court-extends-physician-assisted.php">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled</a> [JURIST report] that people with serious mental illnesses may be permitted to commit physician-assisted suicide under certain conditions. Also in 2007 the House of Lords in the UK <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">set aside a proposed bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize assisted suicide due to opposition by physician groups. The UK has continued this trend, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/uk-court-upholds-law-against-euthanasia.php">upholding a law against euthanasia</a> [JURIST report] in a Court of Appeals case in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2006, Virginia voters ratified an amendment (Article I section 15-A) to the <a href="http://constitution.legis.virginia.gov/Constitution-01-13.pdf">Virginia Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which deemed marriage as a union only between a man and a woman. Judge Arenda Wright Allen wrote in the court opinion that Virginia's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage violates a "fundamental freedom," stating:<blockquote>Virginia's laws ensures that marriage provides profound legal, financial, and social benefits, and exacts serious legal, financial, and social obligations. The government's involvement in defining marriage, and in attaching benefits that accompany the institution, must withstand constitutional scrutiny. Laws that fail that scrutiny must fall despite the depth and legitimacy of the laws' religious heritage. The Court is compelled to conclude that Virginia's Marriage Laws unconstitutionally deny Virginia's gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental freedom to choose to marry.</blockquote>The opinion concluded that the Virginia amendment violates due process and equal protection rights given to individuals by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution.

<p>Controversy over <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues in the US, with 33 states having bans on the practice and 17 permitting it. On Wednesday four same-sex married couples joined with the <a href="http://forumforequality.org/wp/">Forum for Equality Louisiana</a> [advocacy website] in <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/couples-challenge-louisiana-constitutions-prohibition-against-recognizing-same-sex-marriages.php">filing</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit challenging the Louisiana Constitution's prohibition against recognizing same-sex marriages legally performed in other states. Also on Wednesday a judge for the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-must-recognize-same-sex-marriages-performed-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Kentucky must recognize valid out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples living in Kentucky. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/doj-extends-benefits-to-all-same-sex-marriages.php">issued a policy memorandum</a> [JURIST report] stating that the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] will recognize and extend benefits to all same-sex marriages, including those performed in states that do not recognize them. Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week that her office would no longer be pursing its legal defense of the state's same-sex marriage ban, stating that the recent decisions in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had rendered the states arguments untenable. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the legislation, the bill was introduced out of concern that a fetus can feel pain by 20 weeks gestation. House member <a href="http://www.andygipson.com">Andy Gipson</a> [personal website], author of HB 1400, <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20140213/NEWS010504/140213013/Miss-House-passes-20-week-abortion-ban-shoots-down-rape-incest-exemption">said</a> [video] the only exceptions to the proposed ban are "for the life of the mother or in a case where the baby just can't live regardless of medical treatment." In a statement Thursday, Gipson asserted that medical evidence shows that "the unborn at this age can feel pain" and that the proposed law would help to protect the unborn and their mothers. The bill, which passed the House with an 89-22 vote, heads to the Republican-led <a href="http://www.legislature.ms.gov/Pages/default.aspx">state Senate</a> [official website] where it is likely to pass next month. Mississippi <a href="http://www.governorbryant.com">Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official website] is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/13/us-usa-abortion-mississippi-idUSBREA1C1PZ20140213">expected to sign the bill into law</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Since abortion became legal in the US in 1973, it has been a <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/detail.php">highly-debated issue</a> [JURIST backgrounder] with many conservative states continually attempting to restrict, if not outlaw, its occurrence. Mississippi is one more in a series of states, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/arkansas-abortion-law-challenged.php">Arkansas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/texas-urges-supreme-court-to-allow-restrictive-abortion-law-to-remain-in-effect.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports], that have passed similar abortion restrictions. If the bill becomes law, Mississippi will become the thirteenth state to enact a 20-week abortion ban since 2010, according to the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website]. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rule on Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week ban on abortions after having been stuck down by a federal appeals court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The document also suggests a protocol for submitting suspicious activity reports as part of a bank's duty in servicing marijuana businesses. But banks are still wary that the guidelines do not provide sufficient protections to make them confident enough to provide services to the marijuana industry.

Homosexuality has long been illegal in Uganda, and the bill was introduced to inflict harsher penalties for the crime. The bill would impose life sentences for "aggravated homosexuality" and criminalize not reporting gay people. The bill is supported by a strong majority of members in the Ugandan parliament, and the alleged rationale is the need to protect the nation's youth and the greater population from the "emerging internal and external threats to the traditional heterosexual family." Museveni had previously <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uganda-president-refuses-to-sign-anti-gay-legislation.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] the bill as too harsh and at first sought a compromise with parliament. 

<p>The bill's history has garnered international attention since it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in December, and many see it as a reaction to major legislative reforms in support of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US and other Western nations. Last November the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/controversional-uganda-anti-gay-bill-to-pass-by-end-of-2012-ap-report.php">bolstered</a> [JURIST report] by religious leaders in Uganda. In February of that year Ugandan MP David Bahati announced that clauses mandating the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality" would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-to-drop-death-penalty-from-bill-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] from the controversial bill. In 2010 US President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined the US Congress in <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">denouncing the bill</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25463942">Roughly two-thirds</a> [BBC report, map] of African nations criminalize homosexuality, according to an Amnesty International report published earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Amid protests over suspected government corruption and even <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/turkey-tightens-control-over-judiciary-201421514231731579.html">violence inside parliament</a> [Al Jazeera report] the ruling <a href="http://www.siyasetakademisi.org/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] pushed through the bill giving the Justice Ministry more control over the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HSYK) [official website]. The bill comes amid growing controversy that has forced high level officials, including members of Erdogan's cabinet, to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">resign</a> [JURIST report]. It also stems from the arrests of the sons of the interior minister and two other cabinet members in relation to the corruption investigation. The controversy has sparked protests, which police have begun cracking down on in recent days. Since the graft scandal broke, the Turkish government has transferred or dismissed thousands of police officers and hundreds of judges and prosecutors. 

<p>Last week the Turkish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-tighten-internet-restrictions.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation to heighten Internet restrictions, granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without the court's approval. In December Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">named</a> [JURIST report] ten new members of his cabinet following the resignation of three members under investigation for graft. The controversy has highlighted some of the issues surrounding Turkey's judicial system. Also in December a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-court-rejects-release-of-detained-kurdish-lawmakers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] bids to release two members of the parliament for the Kurdish Peace and Democratic Party (BDP), Gulser Yildirim and Ibrahim Ayhan. Yildirim and Ayhan have been detained since 2010 when they were each charged with links to the militant <a href="http://www.pkkonline.com/en/">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> (PKK) [party website]. This decision came after Turkey's top court <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/152694/lengthy-detentions-39-unconstitutional-39-turkey-39-s-top-court-rules.html">ruled</a> [Turkish Weekly report] that the long-term detention of another member of parliament of the opposing party pending trial was in contradiction to the <a href="http://global.tbmm.gov.tr/docs/constitution_en.pdf">Constitution of the Republic of Turkey</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi continues to reject the allegations against him, and the trial has faced a number of setbacks, following his <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/egypt-court-adjourns-morsi-trial-until-january.php">court appearance</a> [JURIST report] in early November. Sunday's trial was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2014/02/morsi-espionage-trial-adjourned-2014216115021654159.html">adjourned</a> [Al Jazeera report] shortly after it began, when the judge denied a request from Morsi's defense lawyers to remove the soundproof glass enclosure in which Morsi and the other 35 co-defendants were placed. Morsi's lawyers argued the glass prevented him from hearing the proceedings and communicating. When the judge refused to remove the glass cage, the lawyers exited the courtroom. The trial was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-morsi-lawyers-protest-courts-glass-cage/2014/02/16/e93fbefa-9700-11e3-ae45-458927ccedb6_story.html">adjourned until February 23</a> [WP report].

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. Morsi is a member of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12313405">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>], which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] by the Egpytian government in September 2013. Morsi's trial signifies Egypt's political transition from the authority of the Muslim Brotherhood into a new regime. Morsi appeared before the court earlier this month, but the trial was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/trial-of-ousted-egypt-president-resumes.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] to give a committee of media members time to inspect video evidence the court declassified for the trial. Last month, Egypt's interim president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt will hold presidential elections before conducting parliamentary elections.

HRW cited new evidence of cluster bombs, including intact unexploded submunitions or "bomblets," discovered by UN experts in the week of February 7 near the town of Bor, an area not known to be contaminated by similar remnants before December. The report notes the town of Bor has been a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25509910">center of conflict</a> [BBC report] in the previous two months, as control over the area changed hands between government forces, the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/spla.htm">Sudan People's Liberation Army</a> (SPLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], and the opposition forces loyal to former vice president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25402865">Riek Machar</a> [BBC profile].

HRW reports, "South Sudanese and Ugandan forces possess the air power to deliver air dropped cluster munitions, such as the RBK-250-275 AO-1SCh cluster bomb, while the opposition forces are not believed to possess the means necessary to deliver these bombs."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/south-sudan/">South Sudan</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been criticized for its human rights abuses since becoming an independent nation, and the domestic conflict is characterized by severe ethnic and sectarian violence. In an article published last week, JURIST guest columnist Kevin Cope of Georgetown University Law Center <a href="/forum/2014/02/kevin-cope-south-sudan.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that constitutional structure may have a larger impact on the crisis in South Sudan than members of the international community realize. Last week HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-report-traffickers-torturing-eritreans-in-sudan-and-egypt.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an analysis outlining the prevalent trafficking and torture of Eritrean refugees for ransom by Sudanese and Egyptian individuals that has been occurring since 2010.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] asked the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] to set up an independent probe to ensure accountability for atrocities committed during the war. Pillay forwarded the Sri Lankan government an <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/140216/columns/pillays-bombshell-report-corners-rajapaksa-regime-85793.html">advance copy of a 72-page report</a> [Sunday Times report], accusing Sri Lanka of failing to investigate rights abuses and continuing to violate democratic freedoms. Along with a recommendation to establish an international inquiry mechanism to investigation alleged violations of international human rights, the report also recommends the criminalization of disappearances and prosecution of persons attacking minority communities. There was no immediate response from the Sri Lankan foreign ministry. 

<p>There has been mounting pressure on the Sri Lankan government to investigation and prosecute abuses during the conflict. Earlier this week, the main opposition party in Sri Lanka, the <a href="http://www.unp.lk/">United National Party</a> (UNP) [party website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/sri-lanka-opposition-party-demands-domestic-war-crimes-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] the Sri Lankan government conduct an investigation into alleged war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War. The Sri Lankan government has been accused of deliberately shelling civilians, blocking food and medicine for civilians trapped in the war zone and deliberately undercounting civilians caught up in fighting. The Tamil rebels have been accused of using civilians as human shields, killing those who tried to escape their hold and recruiting child soldiers. According to a November 2012 UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/The_Internal_Review_Panel_report_on_Sri_Lanka.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] an estimated 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed in the final months of the conflict. Last week the <a href="http://www.piac.asn.au/frontpage">Public Interest Advocacy Center</a> (PIAC) [advocacy website], an Australian nonprofit legal advocacy group, released a report <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/investigation-reveals-possible-war-crimes-in-sri-lanka.php">detailing possible war crimes</a> [JURIST report] and crimes against humanity during the final months of the civil war. The reports findings will be incorporated into an upcoming meeting of the UN Human Rights Council sponsored by the US. Last month US ambassador Stephen Rapp <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to investigate rights abuses by security forces during the civil war. In November UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/britain-pm-demands-independent-sri-lanka-rights-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the Sri Lankan government conduct its own investigation into war crime allegations. In September Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sri-lanka-must-improve-human-rights-record-un-rights-chief.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to improve its human rights record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors argued that the explosion was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence of arms trafficking to Ecuador and Croatia in violation of international embargoes.The blast killed seven people and injured dozens. According to the AP, Argentina's Judicial Authority said that the tribunal <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/case-against-carlos-menem-1995-blast-dismissed">dismissed the case</a> [AP report] against 83-year-old Menem on Wednesday due to the lack of sufficient evidence. 

<p>In September Menem <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-argentina-president-on-trial-for-tax-fraud.php">appeared in court</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly falsifying his 2000 tax returns. In June Argentina's highest criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/argentina-court-sentences-former-president-to-7-years-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Menem of selling illegal weapons to Croatia and Ecuador during his presidency. Menem pleaded innocent, claiming that the weapons were intended for Panama and Venezuela but were stolen and sold to parties that violated the country's <a href="http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/ep_rio01291942.pdf">peace agreements</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://books.sipri.org/files/misc/UNAE/SIPRI07UNAEYug.pdf">UN embargoes</a> [summary]. In 2011 Menem was also put on trial for crimes committed during his presidency. Menem was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/argentina-ex-president-cabinet-members.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the Federal Court in 2009 on corruption charges for overpaying members of his administration from 1988 to 1989. In October 2008 an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/argentina-ex-president-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Menem with allegedly covering up evidence related to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. Menem, born in Argentina to Syrian immigrants, was accused of covering up the alleged involvement of Syrian-Argentine businessman Alberto Kanoore Edul. Numerous members of his <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Menem">administration</a> [JURIST news archive] have also faced a variety of charges over the past decade, but few have been convicted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/hamid-karzai-law-afghan-women">proposed criminal procedure law</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] expressly prohibits "relatives" from testifying against each other in criminal proceedings, which may have the effect of silencing victims of domestic abuse. The law does not define a "relative," leading analysts to posit that the bill's proscriptive scope may extend to a wider variety of witness than Afghan authorities predict, especially in villages adhering to complex marriage and blood family frameworks. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the law will make it more difficult for women to vindicate their rights after domestic abuse. Reports indicate that Karzai and his advisers have yet to expound upon the extent to which the law will be revised before it is sent back to parliament. 

<p>Afghanistan has been the <a href="/hotline/2009/08/afghanistans-shia-personal-status-law.php">target of much criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] regarding human rights issues, including women's rights. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/un-afghanistan-government-reponse-to-violence-against-women-inadequate-despite-increased-reporting--.php">released a study</a> [JURIST report] in December that raised concern over the treatment of women in the country. The report states there was an increase of reported acts of violence against women to the Afghan authorities in the past year, but prosecutions and convictions under the landmark Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) law remained low and most cases were settled through mediation. Reported incidents of forced marriage, domestic violence and rape all increased by 28 percent, but the indictments under EVAW only increased by 2 percent. In November the HRW reported the Afghanistan Justice Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/hrw-afghanistan-penal-code-working-group-proposes-stoning-for-adultery.php">proposed </a>[JURIST report] new provisions to the nation's penal code that allow for stoning as punishment for adultery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, which is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-korea-north-un-excerpts-idUSBREA1G0OF20140217">to be debated</a> [Reuters report] by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in Geneva on March 17, includes <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14242&LangID=E">excerpts of witness testimony</a> [press release] taken from the statements of more than 80 victims and witnesses in South Korea, Japan, Britain and the US. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14255&LangID=E">abuses described in the report</a> [press release] include murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, the enforced disappearance of people and knowingly causing starvation. It goes on to say that "the gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world." Commissioners summarized their findings in a letter to the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, and stated that they would recommend referral of the situation to the ICC. North Korea has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-korea-north-un-rejection-idUSBREA1G0IG20140217">rejected the report</a> [Reuters report], claiming that it was based on faked materials and was an instrument of a political plot meant to sabotage their system and defame the country. 

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter human rights abuses occurring in North Korea in the past. In September the UNHRC commission responsible for investigating potential human rights violations in North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-commission-finds-serious-violations-in-north-korea.php">reported widespread human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] occurring in the country. Last February Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts announced their <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">support for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps. Also last February Darusman urged the UNHRC and the General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea. Last November he also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the country's lack of development in human rights, and called on its new leader, Kim Jong-un, to remedy the matter. Last January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay<a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php"> condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the decrease in the number of individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdowns on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors specifically alleged that Merabishvili <a href="http://www.timesofoman.com/News/Article-29934.aspx">used government money</a> [AFP report] to employ his supporters in fictitious government roles in advance of his party's October 2012 parliamentary elections. The court also handed down a USD $27,000 fine to Merabishvili's co-defendant, former health minister Zurab Chiaberashvili. Reports indicate that both the prosecution and the defendants plan to appeal the ruling in pursuit of harsher and more lenient sentences respectively. Merabishvili and his lawyers claim he is innocent of the charges and that the prosecution is political in nature. The Georgian government reportedly denies that the prosecution stems from any political agenda.

<p>Corruption continues to be a heavily-litigated issue around the globe. In February Turkey's parliament passed a law <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-approve-bill-increasing-control-over-judiciary.php">giving parliament more control over how judges are appointed</a> [JURIST report]. Amid protests over suspected government corruption and even violence inside parliament the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) pushed through the bill giving the Justice Ministry more control over the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK). Also in February the European Commission (EC) <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/corruption-costing-eu-billions-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the EU Anti-Corruption Report, which found that corruption costs EU member states approximately &#8364;120 billion each year. The first-ever EC report on the subject details the nature of corruption in each member state as well as the impact corruption has on the European economy. In January the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eu-warns-romania-over-continued-corruption-judicial-concerns.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its semi-annual Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report on Romania, warning the nation to end political pressure on the judiciary amid continuing concerns over corruption. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Although there is no precedent for it as of yet, the law <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/israeli-court-discusses-anti-boycott-law-183543865.html">makes a boycott call a civil issue</a> [AP report] that could allow for lawsuits seeking compensation. Those who support the law say that it protects against geography-based discrimination. The examination of the boycott ban comes during a<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/world/middleeast/west-bank-boycott-a-political-act-or-prejudice.html?_r=0"> boycott campaign against products</a> [NYT report] made in Israel's settlements on the West Bank by much of the international community, who says that the settlements are illegal because they are built on war-won land. The movement has been called immoral by <a href="http://www.netanyahu.org.il/en/">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website], while executive vice chairman of the <a href="http://www.conferenceofpresidents.org/">Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.conferenceofpresidents.org/about/leadership">Malcolm Hoenlein</a> [official profile] accused it of being a politically correct form of antisemitism. The court is expected to deliver a ruling on whether the law will stand within the next few months. 

<p>In October top UN and EU officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/israel-settlement-plans-criticized-as-unlawful.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] the renewed plans for Israeli settlements by the Israeli Prime Minister's Office and Ministry of the Interior, which included building more than 1,500 homes in Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Earlier in October Netanyahu announced that Israel would participate in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/ILSession15.aspx">review </a>[review docket] of its human rights record, ending an 18-month boycott. This marked another chapter in Israel's tumultuous relationship with the UNHRC. The UNHRC originally planned the review of the country last January, but were forced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-council-calls-on-israel-to-resume-participation-in-human-rights-review.php">postpone</a> [JURIST report] because the Israeli government failed to send a representative. Former foreign minister Avigdor Liberman <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/israel-severs-ties-with-the-un-rights-council-over-investigation-into-west-bank-settlements.php">cut ties</a> [JURIST report] with the UNHCR in March 2012, after the council commenced an international investigation [press release] into Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In 2010, before the boycott, the Israeli ambassador <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/israel-asks-un-rights-committee-to-cease-probe-into-2008-2009-gaza-conflict.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to the UNHRC investigation into Israeli actions during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">2008-2009 Gaza campaign</a> [JURIST news archive], Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in the deaths of 1,400 Palestinians. Despite this, the UNHRC in September of 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-human-rights-council-adopts-report-on-israel-flotilla-raid.php">adopted </a>a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-report-finds-israel-flotilla-raid-violated-international-law.php">report </a>[JURIST reports] criticizing Israel's raid of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=flotilla">Gaza-bound flotilla</a> [JURIST news archive] and finding the country committed various violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lee, a member of the opposition <a href="http://nisout.goupp.org/">United Progressive Party</a> [party website, in Korean] in South Korea's <a href="http://korea.na.go.kr/">National Assembly</a> [official website], was arrested in September on charges that he <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/26/south-korean-charged-plot-overthrow-government">discussed strikes on South Korea's infrastructure</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the event of a war with North Korea in violation of South Koreas's National Security Act. The district court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-korea-politics-idUSBREA1G0G920140217">held</a> [Reuters report] that Lee's planned revolt posed a risk despite the fact that the conflict between North and South Korea did not occur that year. Lee member of parliament sentenced under the National Security Act since democratic elections took place in 1988 and his arrest has raised concerns that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-south-korea-treason-20140217,0,6296182.story?track=rss#axzz2tbrOTqLw">the South Korean government is violating free speech</a> [LAT report]. 

<p>Lee's prosecution is not the first instance of South Korea using the National Security Act to suppress free speech and expression. In November, 2010, South Korea's high court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/south-korea-high-court-rules-pro-north-korea-music-violates-security-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that pro-North Korean music violates the National Security Act. In September 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch </a>(HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/09/17/south-korea-abolish-or-fix-national-security-law">criticized South Korea</a> [press release] for using the act to restrict speech that does not pose a threat to national security and stated that the use of the law "clear violates South Korea's international human rights obligations. However, in 2004 an estimated <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2004/10/south-koreans-rally-in-support-of.php">100,000 protesters</a> [JURIST report] gathered to rally against calls to repeal the Act. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nashiri faces terror charges in connection with the al Qaeda <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uss+cole">attack on the USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2000, which killed 17 American service members. The prisoner was scheduled for an eight-day hearing to address representation issues in an attempt to narrow the scope of the death-penalty case. Right before the hearing was set to begin, Nashiri's defense attorney, Rick Kammen, told the judge that his client was considering firing him. Kammen requested a short recess to allow him the chance to preserve the attorney-client relationship. While some have seen this recess as a stalling tactic, the prisoner's defense argues that the prolonged proceedings stem from complicated matters of secrecy and the death penalty. Additionally, the defense states that <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] tactics have caused Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the client, creating further difficulty in the case.

<p>This is the latest development in Nashiri's case. In December, Nashiri's counsel argued before the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/guantanamo-detainees-accuse-poland-in-cia-rendition-torture.php">accusing</a> [JURIST report] Poland of serving as a secret torture site for the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency's</a> (CIA) [official website] <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last February, Colonel Pohl ordered a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-mental-health-exam-for-suspected-uss-cole-bomber.php">mental health examination</a> [JURIST report] for Nashiri to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. This came after Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-refuses-to-halt-uss-cole-hearing.php">refused to halt</a> [JURIST report] further hearings in response to unsubstantiated allegations by defense counsel that the government was eavesdropping on private conversations with their client. The month before, Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-judge-denies-defense-motions-in-911-uss-cole-trials.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Nashiri's lawyers to to dismiss the alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/Portals/0/MCA20Pub20Law200920.pdf">Military Commissions Act</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] on the grounds that the bombing occurred "prior to the commencement of hostilities" between the US and al Queda.

According to the experts, the provisions effectively deny women the right to marital property upon divorce or death of their spouse without a showing that the woman made a contribution to property acquisition during marriage. The act became effective as of January 16, 2014, and could cost many women in Kenya lands where they currently reside, farm and generate income. The provisions were criticized for violating Kenya's human rights obligations to women under equal access to land and property rights. The head of the working group, Frances Raday stated that "very few women will be able to demonstrate such a contribution under the new provisions, since few Kenyan women have land title deeds in their own names and even less hold deeds jointly with men." The inability to demonstrate a woman's contribution could decrease a woman's security if the a woman's husband leaves his wife or children by removing all rights the woman has to her home and method of subsistence.

<p>The UN and the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] have been calling for increased legal protections of women's rights worldwide. Last Thursday, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-somali-officials-must-reform-to-prevent-sexual-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Somali government to adopt reforms to help prevent sexual violence against women and provide support for victims. Two weeks ago, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-iraq-women-being-abused-in-detention.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Iraqi security officials are detaining thousands of women illegally and subjecting them to torture, ill-treatment and threats of sexual abuse. Also that week, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/afghanistan-president-should-refuse-to-sign-law-denying-women-protection.php">encouraged</a> [JURIST report] Afghanistan <a href="http://president.gov.af/en">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official website] to refuse to sign a law passed by parliament that they say would deny women protection from domestic violence and forced marriage. Early this month, the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Trafficking/Pages/CVJoyNgoziEzeilo.aspx">Joy Ngozi Ezeilo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-expert-urges-seychelles-to-adopt-anti-trafficking-measures.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the island nation of Seychelles to establish a National Action Plan to combat human trafficking, and to hasten to pass the draft anti-trafficking bill currently circulating in its legislature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last May, Georgia <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website] signed into law <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/sites/gov.georgia.gov/files/related_files/document/HB%20122.pdf">HB 122</a> [PDF], which included a provision mandating that "the identifying information of any person or entity that manufactures, supplies, compounds, or prescribes the drugs, medical supplies, or medical equipment utilized in the execution of a death sentence" be classified as a confidential state secret. Death row inmate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=warren+hill">Warren Lee Hill Jr.</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/states-lethal-injection-secrecy-law-challenged/ndRc2/">alleges</a> [<em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> report] that the law prevents inmates from ascertaining whether the drugs to be used for an execution could cause impermissible suffering and harm. In granting Hill's emergency injunction against his execution, the <a href="http://www.fultoncourt.org/">Superior Court of Fulton County</a> [official website] found that Hill <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/HillStayOrder.pdf">would likely succeed</a> [order, PDF] in a challenge to the law's constitutionality. The Supreme Court of Georgia will deliver a ruling on whether the Fulton County judge will be permitted to actually adjudicate the constitutionality of the law in four to six months.

<p>There is a shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs in the US, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols. Last week a federal judge in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] a trial to review the constitutionality of the state's new execution protocol, which delayed the prisoner's execution for 90 days. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain; his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf has repeatedly delayed appearing in court, first <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/us-pakistan-musharraf-idUSBREA1H0GG20140218">based</a> [Reuters report] on fear of bomb threats and later on his failing health; he was admitted to the hospital for chest pains at the beginning of January. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26239352">Appearing</a> [BBC report] before a special three-judge panel, Musharraf was able to wave at the judges to acknowledge their presence but did not speak during the proceedings. He was reportedly present in court for only 20 minutes. The court did not yet charge Musharraf but instead indicated that it would decide Friday whether it properly had jurisdiction over a former military officer. Musharraf's lawyers have argued that his case should be tried in a military rather than a civil court. Musharraf has continuously alleged that the charges against him are politically motivated and baseless. The trial is being closely watched for any potential impact on the balance of power in Pakistan between the military, judiciary, and civilian government. If convicted, Musharraf could face the death penalty. 

<p>Musharraf has faced a variety of legal troubles since his return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile, though until now it was unclear whether he would ever actually appear in court. He had sought to delay his appearance for medical reasons and requested his travel ban be lifted to go abroad to seek medical treatment, a request the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-denies-musharraf-request-to-go-abroad-for-medical-treatment---dnp.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] in January 31, instead issuing a "bailable" arrest warrant. Earlier in January the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that he was too sick to attend proceedings scheduled for January 16 and ordered him to appear, though he ultimately did not do so. Also currently ongoing are proceedings related to Musharraf's involvement in the 2007 Red Mosque killings and the death of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October for his role in the Red Mosque massacre after nearly six months of house arrest for the charges relating to the death of Bhutto, for which he was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Act combats various online crimes such as hacking, identify theft, child pornography and libel. While the Act was suspended shortly after it passed in 2012, the law will now go into effect following Tuesday's ruling, with certain limitations. The judges upheld libel executed online as a criminal offense, but only the original author of the libelous information may be charged; not individuals that merely receive, share or comment on the information. Also, the court decided the criminal penalties on libel should be mitigated from the 12-year maximum prison sentence or a minimum fine of USD $4,400 dollars under the law as written in 2012. Notably, the judges ruled parts of the law unconstitutional, such as the provision that real-time surveillance by authorities is allowed without a court order.

<p>Since passing the Philippines legislature in the middle of 2012, the Act incited controversy in the Asian country and it has faced a number of temporary suspensions over the past two years. Last February the Philippine high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/philippines-supreme-court-again-stays-cybercrime-law.php">stopped</a> [JURIST report] the government from enforcing the Act. In October 2012 the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/philippines-supreme-court-suspends-cybercrimes-law.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the Act for 120 days after it officially went into effect in September 2012 when <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph">President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/philippines-president-signs-broad-cybercrimes-law.php">signed it into law</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The largely Republican Senate approved the amendment, sent from the Indiana House of Representatives after a change that removed a ban on same-sex civil unions, by a vote of 32-17. The proposed amendment must still be approved by both chambers of the General Assembly a second time before it can go before voters on a ballot initiative in 2016. Indiana already has statutory prohibitions on same-sex marriage, but a constitutional amendment would be a further hurdle for any judicial challenges to the state's marriage policy.

<p>Controversy over <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues in the US, with 33 states having bans on the practice and 17 permitting it. Earlier this month a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-virgina-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Virginia's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. A day before, four Louisiana couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/couples-challenge-louisiana-constitutions-prohibition-against-recognizing-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state constitution's ban on same-sex marriages. Also in February, the <a href="http://ag.nv.gov/">Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto</a> [official website] announced that her office <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.phpd">would no longer defend</a> [JURIST report] challenges to the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304899704579390400079948312?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304899704579390400079948312.html">allege</a> [WSJ report] that Shinawatra failed to adequately address reports of corruption in the allocation of the subsidies, at a large financial cost to the state. The agency has claims that Shinawatra was negligent in allowing the subsidy program to continue, violating both constitutional and criminal laws. She was ordered to appear to hear the charges in proceedings scheduled for February 27. Shinawatra has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gdedqURJq8aw7iW5ii29k3yrneMg?docId=aebe426e-9916-4700-90cd-45e8b6a12aee">denied</a> [AFP report] the allegations and defended the programs as beneficial to rural farmers, blaming delayed payments on political rivals. If convicted impeachment proceedings will begin to have her removed from office.

<p>Shinawatra's administration is currently under heavy protest from the political opposition in Thailand, and recent weeks have been marred by political violence. This announcement came mere hours after a police officer and three civilians were killed and 64 others injured in clashes in the city's historical district. On February 12 the Thai Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects-bid-to-annul-election.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] petitions filed by the opposition Democrat Party to annul the January elections on the grounds that they were held unconstitutionally since they were not completed in a single day. The petition also <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-opposition-party-petitions-court-to-annul-election.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the dissolution of the ruling party and a ban on party executives from holding public office for a period of five years. On January 26 the opposition protest leader Suthin Thararin was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">shot</a> [JURIST report] to death in Bangkok during a protest blocking a voting station, just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency in response to the protests and violence.

In Tuesday's ruling, the court extended a murderer's 40-year sentence to a whole life sentence, overruling the trial judge who refused to issue the whole life penalty. Additionally, the court dismissed an appeal for another convicted murderer, who argued his life sentence was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26236225">manifestly excessive</a> [BBC report]. The UK Court of Appeal held domestic laws permit whole life sentences and that they are compatible with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], while emphasizing that Tuesday's decision turns on specific facts and is not a guide to any similar case:<blockquote>Although there may be debate in a democratic society as to whether a judge should have the power to make a whole life order, in our view, it is evident, as reflected in <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/schedule/21">Schedule 21</a> [text], that there are some crimes that are so heinous that Parliament was entitled to proscribe, compatibly with the Convention, that the requirements of just punishment encompass passing a sentence which includes a whole life order.</blockquote>UK Attorney General Dominic Grieve <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/whole-life-orders-ian-mcloughlin">welcomed</a> [press release] Tuesday's ruling, saying it "gives the clarity our judges need when they are considering sentencing cases like this in the future."

<p>Tension between the UK judiciary and the ECHR has increased recently, as the UK has issued conflicting rulings on major human rights issues and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23245254">criticized</a> [BBC report] the position of the ECHR, which enforces the European Convention on Human Rights among the 47 member states of the <a href="http://hub.coe.int">Council of Europe</a> [official website]. The President of the ECHR, <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/pages/home.aspx?p=court/president&c=">Judge Dean Spielmann</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4134/echr-uk">threatened</a> [Gatestone Institute report] the UK last June with ejection from the EU. The UK has argued the ECHR is as a judicial body that cannot be challenged, and the UK has ruled since 2011 their domestic courts are <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-top-judge-national-courts-not-bound-by-europe-rights-court.php">not bound</a> [JURIST report] by ECHR rulings. In October a <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/uk-spy-agency-facing-rights-court-challenge-over-surveillance.php">claim was filed</a> [JURIST report] in the ECHR against the UK spy agency, <a href="http://www.gchq.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx">GCHQ</a> [official website], based on the agency's surveillance powers.          </p>]]></content:encoded>

Plaintiff in the case, Shabazz Augustine, was a suspect in the 2004 homicide of his girlfriend. Augustine was arrested after police obtained his cell phone records from Sprint by use of a federal law that only requires information to be <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/02/18/state-high-court-says-warrants-are-needed-for-law-enforcement-obtain-cellphone-location-data/fp7v4m3GeyZRE80nfyukVO/story.html">relevant to an investigation</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report], as opposed to a search warrant, which requires a judge to find probable cause regarding the subject's involvement in committing a crime. The phone records were then used to pinpoint Augustine's location at the time of the murder. The court held that obtaining Augustine's cell phone records without an actual warrant violated Article 14 of the Massachusetts Constitution, pertaining to unreasonable search and seizures. The <a href="http://www.aclum.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] represented Augustine in this case. ACLU Massachusetts legal director Matthew Segal stated regarding the case, "Today's ruling is an enormous victory for privacy in the Commonwealth, and it means that Massachusetts is taking an important lead in dealing with the privacy implications of the digital age. Under this ruling, turning on a cell phone does not justify warrantless local and state surveillance of when, where and how you use it." The case is now on remand to determine if prosecutors would have been able to meet the standard for obtaining a search warrant for the cell phone records. 

<p>The governmental use of private individuals' cellular phone data has been cause of substantial controversy in recent months. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in January <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-grants-cell-phone-privacy-case.php">granted review</a> [JURIST report] over the issue of police authority to search the contents of an arrested individual's cell phone. The court accepted two cases on the matter to review. The first, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/riley-v-california/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Riley v. California</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], is a state court case that involves a challenge to searching an arrested individual without a warrant. After being arrested, police examined Riley's cell phone, which was described as more of a hand-held computer. In the federal case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-wurie/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">United States v. Wurie</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will examine a similar fact pattern, but the cell phone was an ordinary flip-phone. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/fifth-circuit-rules-warrant-not-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that warrants were not required to track cell phones. In the same month the New Jersey Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-jersey-supreme-court-rules-warrants-required-to-track-cell-phones.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that police must obtain search warrants before obtaining tracking information from cell phone providers, marking the first time a state supreme court has recognized a Fourth Amendment protection for cell phone location data. In May the Florida Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/florida-top-court-rules-warrantless-cell-phone-searches-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that police need a warrant to search a defendant's cell phone at the time of arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Law No. 5 of 2014 imposes prison sentences on any individual "undermining the February 17 revolution" and for "publicly insulting one of the legislative, executive or judicial authorities." Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani stated that the amendments, as well as the recent increase in attacks against journalists in the country, go against the "spirit" of the country's revolution. She acknowledged that one of the important documents adopted after the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was the Constitutional Declaration, which guarantees the freedoms of opinion and communication, as well as liberty of the press, printing, publication and mass media, in accordance with the law. Shamdasani spoke of the importance of impartial, effective investigations against perpetrators of crimes against journalists and stated, "We also look forward to the beginning of the process of drafting the constitution and hope that Libya will use this opportunity to build upon the commitments made in the Constitutional Declaration and firmly enshrine human rights principles, including the right to freedom of expression and opinion, in the legal system." Shamdasani also reported that the OHCHR, through the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL), will assist the General National Congress in reconsidering amendments to the penal code, in order to ensure their compliance with international human rights standards.

<p>The OHCHR and other international and human rights organizations have urged the Libyan government to continue taking measures to end impunity within the country. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in November <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/icc-prosecutor-urges-libya-to-work-with-court-end-impunity-gap.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Libya to address serious crimes committed in the country and encouraged the international community to end the impunity gap in Libya.

Pillay referred to the acts committed in North Korea as so atrocious as to not have any parallel in the contemporary world.<blockquote>Insufficient attention was being paid to the kind of horrific and sustained human rights violations that are reported to be taking place on an ongoing basis in the DPRK. ... That has now been partly rectified. We now need strong international leadership to follow up on the grave findings of the Commission of Inquiry. I therefore call on the international community, in line with the report&#8217;s recommendations, to use all the mechanisms at its disposal to ensure accountability, including referral to the International Criminal Court.</blockquote>The independent Commission of Inquiry is scheduled to present its report to the 47 member sates of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on March 17 in Geneva, Switzerland. 

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter human rights abuses occurring in North Korea in the past. In September the UN commission responsible for investigating potential human rights violations in North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-commission-finds-serious-violations-in-north-korea.php">reported widespread human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] occurring in the country. Last February Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts announced their <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">support for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps. Also last February Darusman urged the UNHRC and the General Assembly to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-expert-urges-probe-of-north-korea.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea. In November 2012 he also <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-criticizes-north-korea-human-rights-record-and-focus-on-military.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the country's lack of development in human rights, and called on its new leader, Kim Jong-un, to remedy the matter. Last January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-condemns-human-rights-record-in-north-korea.php">condemned North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] and urged the international community to make efforts to improve the situation. Pillay's plea came only days after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-un-commission-must-examine-human-rights-in-north-korea.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to examine human rights abuses, particularly in light of the decrease in the number of individuals escaping into China and reports by successful escapees of increasing crackdowns on escape attempts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While Gul and Turkish <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13746679">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] continue to reaffirm the law's purpose of protecting online privacy, many have waged harsh criticism against the legislation, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2014/02/the-last-chance-to-stop-turkeys-harsh-new-internet-law.html">calling</a> [<em>New Yorker</em> report] it harmful, Draconian, and the latest strike against freedom of expression in Turkey.

In addition to stricter government oversight, the law also requires service providers to collect and retain individual data for up to two years. 

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world.

The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom.

While authorities have reportedly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/us/violent-crimes-declined-in-first-half-of-2013-fbi-says.html?_r=0">attributed the reductions to more effective law enforcement</a> [NYT report], the FBI urges those using the data to account for various factors:<blockquote>Individuals using these [crime] tabulations are cautioned against drawing conclusions by making direct comparisons between cities. Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction. It is important to remember that crime is a social problem and, therefore, a concern of the entire community. The efforts of law enforcement are limited to factors within its control. The data user is, therefore, cautioned against comparing statistical data of individual agencies.</blockquote>Reports indicate that the FBI's data continues a 25-year decline in violent crime and property crime within the US.

<p>In October 2012 the FBI released its annual report on violent and property crime, which found that the number of violent crimes reported to law enforcement <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/fbi-violent-crime-drops-again-in-2011.php">decreased</a> [JURIST report] for the fifth consecutive year and the number of property crimes reported decreased for the ninth consecutive year. Also in October 2012 the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-violent-property-crime-rates-increased-in-2011-doj.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that both violent crime and property crime rates increased from 2010 to 2011. In June 2012 the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fbi-reports-another-year-of-decrease-in-violent-crime.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report documenting that the overall rate of violent crimes has decreased throughout the nation. In December 2011 The FBI announced that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/fbi-reports-decrease-in-violent-crime-for-2011.php">violent crime in the US has dropped</a> [JURIST report], continuing a trend lasting for the past four-and-a-half years. The 2011 figures for January through June were compiled by the Bureau's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) in a preliminary semiannual report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to ruling on the constitutionality of the special orders, the court <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/thailand-unrest-protesters-besiege-prime-ministers-office">upheld</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the state of emergency declared by the <a href="http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/">Cabinet of Thailand</a> [official website] in January, finding that action was within the power of the executive branch. The court's decision comes just a day after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26224510">violence erupted</a> [BBC report] in Bangkok as police attempted to clear protest sites throughout the city. At least four individuals were killed and dozens more were injured in the clashes.

<p>Thailand has been embroiled in severe political turmoil since November when protesters took to the street to contest the government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile]. Earlier this month Thailand's <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.or.th/english/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects-bid-to-annul-election.php">rejected petitions</a> [JURIST report] filed by both the ruling and opposition parties accusing each other of attempting to overthrow the country's government during recent elections. An anti-government protest leader was killed in Bangkok on Sunday. In January Suthin Thararin, a protest leader for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PDRCThailand">People's Democratic Reform Committee</a> (PDRC) [Facebook page], <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">was shot to death</a> [JURIST report] in front of the Sri Eiam Temple in Bangkok while demonstrators blocked a voting station. The shooting came just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency, granting it broad powers to curtail the political unrest, including the ability to censor media, impose a curfew and detain suspects without charges. These powers are in addition to those granted in November when the prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-prime-minister-invokes-special-security-law-amidst-protests.php">invoked</a> [JURIST report] a special security law known as the Internal Security Act, which conferred broader powers on police forces attempting to contain the protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Miranda, a partner of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">The Guardian</a> [media website] journalist Glenn Greenwald, reportedly alleged that UK authorities <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140219/NEWS06/302190004/U-K-court-Snowden-journalist-s-partner-detention-lawful">violated international law</a> [AP report] protecting free expression when they invoked UK terrorism legislation to detain him and seize classified documents from his person in August. Miranda argued the detention effectively branded journalists as terrorists. The court reportedly reasoned that, because Miranda possessed highly classified UK documents at the time of his detention, UK authorities responded appropriately and in proportion to the risk presented.

<p>Protection of free expression remains a key concern for international human rights advocates. In September two independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-experts-warn-uk-on-press-intimidation.php">stressed</a> [JURIST report] the UK's obligation to ensure that investigative journalists are allowed protection from intimidation and punishment. Frank La Rue, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, put the concerns of press freedom before those of national security secrets, stating that "[t]he press plays a central role in the clarification of human rights abuses." Therefore, says La Rue, "The protection of national security secrets must never be used as an excuse to intimidate the press into silence and backing off from its crucial work in the clarification of human rights violations." The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson, then urged that a debate take place to officially determine what official access of data should be available to the public. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, called the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/documents/billdocs/2013-14/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Bills/6523.pdf">Real Hope Act</a> [text, PDF], was passed in the state's House of Representatives by 75 to 22 votes with strong bipartisan support after nearly six years of campaigning. The new legislation includes $5 million in additional State Need Grant funding to help cover the approximately 1,000 undocumented immigrant students in Washington. The bill has been sent to <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Jay Islee</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/news/releases/article.aspx?id=203">who has promised</a> [statement] to sign it into law: "This is a landmark achievement for the 2014 session," said the Governor in a statement. I appreciate the hard work of the legislators and students who have been working on this for so long and who helped pass this bill. I look forward to signing this bill and celebrating a big step forward for thousands of young Washingtonians."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. In December New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will allow undocumented students to be eligible for in-state tuition rates to attend state colleges. In April Oregon's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/oregon-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public universities at the same tuition rate as in-state residents. In March a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">permanently blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime. Last year Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/alabama-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to overturn a recent decision striking down provisions of Alabama's controversial <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law </a>[HB 56, PDF]. In December 2012, Thrash lifted a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. Thrash's order was in line with an August ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] that provision of the law, but it remains to be seen how police will enforce the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since Mexican <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-12242685">President Felipe Calderon</a> [BBC profile] launched a crackdown on drug cartels in 2008, Mexico has faced a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/us-mexico-marijuana-idUSBREA1I03I20140219">wave of violence</a> [Reuters report] that has resulted in an estimated 70,000 deaths and 26,000 disappearances. PRD members plan on introducing a similar bill in the Mexican House next week. However, it is unclear whether the bill will ultimately be approved given that PRD is only the third largest party in Mexico's congress.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">Marijuana legalization</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial in the US and abroad.

Also last week Italy's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/italy-constitutional-court-strikes-down-tough-marijuana-sentencing-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a harsh marijuana sentencing law.

In January, Florida's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/florida-voters-to-decide-on-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a citizen initiative to vote on the legality of medical marijuana.

US District Judge Terence Kern on Tuesday dismissed inmate Michael Taylor's suit after Tulsa pharmacy The Apothecary Shoppe agreed to not prepare pentobarbital or any other drug for use in the execution. Missouri's execution protocol calls for pentobarbital, but state officials maintain that the state would be able to carry out the February 26 execution of Michael Taylor, who was sentenced to death for the kidnap, rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl, without having to make significant changes to state protocol. It is unclear whether the state has obtained a different drug or an alternative source for pentobarbital. Taylor's attorneys <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2014/02/18/4831828/missouri-execution-on-track-governor.html">filed a motion</a> [<em>Kansas City Star</em> report] in federal court to stay the execution, arguing that a change in the protocol or the pentobarbital supplier a week before the scheduled execution would violate Taylor's right to due process of the law. The state must respond in writing to Taylor's motion for a stay of execution by noon on Thursday. 

<p>There is a shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs in the US, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols. Earlier this week the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/georgia-supreme-court-to-rule-on-challenge-to-execution-drug-secrecy-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to withhold the identities of the manufacturers of Georgia's lethal injection drugs. Last week a federal judge in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] a trial to review the constitutionality of the state's new execution protocol, which delayed the prisoner's execution for 90 days. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain; his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">the prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though homosexuality has long been criminalized in Uganda, the new law imposes harsher penalties, including life sentences for "aggravated homosexuality," and criminal sanctions for those who fail to report homosexuals to the authorities. UNAIDS urged authorities in Uganda to reject the bill and expressed concern over the public health implications of the law, citing studies that show homosexuals are less likely to utilize testing, prevention, and treatment services when they face the possibility of incarceration and discrimination. Globally, gay men are 13 times more likely to become infected with HIV, and, according to 2012 estimates, there are approximately 1.5 million people living in Uganda with HIV. UNAIDS called upon Uganda to repeal the law and replace it with measures that address homophobia and protect homosexuals from violence.

<p>Uganda's anti-homosexuality law has garnered international attention since it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in December and is viewed by many as a reaction to the growing support of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US and other Western nations. Roughly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25463942">two-thirds of African nations</a> [BBC report] criminalize homosexuality, according to a report published by Amnesty International earlier this year. Last November, the Ugandan bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/controversional-uganda-anti-gay-bill-to-pass-by-end-of-2012-ap-report.php">bolstered by religious leaders</a> [JURIST report] who urged Uganda's parliament to pass the bill. In February 2013, Ugandan MP David Bahati announced that clauses mandating the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality" would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-to-drop-death-penalty-from-bill-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] from the controversial bill. In 2010 US President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined the US Congress in <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">denouncing the bill</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

At least 25 individuals have been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kiev-explodes-into-chaos-at-least-25-reported-dead-in-ukraine-protests/2014/02/19/aacecc60-9967-11e3-b88d-f36c07223d88_story.html">reported dead</a> [WP report] and more than 240 injured, in protests that escalated when individuals began a march on Parliament Tuesday morning, before a scheduled debate regarding reinstatement of the country's 2004 Constitution.

Ban stated that "[p]reventing further instability and bloodshed is a paramount priority," while Pillay urged, &#8220;Ukraine needs a dialogue between these opposing voices that respects the country's legal obligations, political commitments based on international human rights standards, and the recommendations made by the international human rights system." Pillay further reiterated a call for respect of the right to peaceful assembly. 

<p>Ongoing protests in Kiev have continued for more than two months, prompting reactions from all sides of the conflict. Earlier in February leaders of Ukraine's anti-government protests <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-opposition-calls-for-constitution-change.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Yanukovich for further concessions, including a return to the earlier constitution that would limit presidential powers, and a revival of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/facilitating-trade/free-trade/">EU free trade agreement</a> (FTA) [existing EU FTAs]. In January the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters. The statement came the day after Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">offered amnesty to protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested and agree to meet certain conditions. The amnesty bill was passed 232-11 and gave protesters 15 days to comply, but has been rejected by the opposition.

Pavlov, an associate of opposition figure Mukhtar Ablyazov, whose extradition was originally <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/french-court-orders-extradition-of-khazakstans-former-energy-minsiter.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] in January by a French court, has been detained by Spanish authorities since 2012 on charges of financial and terrorism-related crimes. Various sources have informed AI that the Council of Ministers has given final approval to the extradition, though no decision has yet been made public. Although the Kazakhstani government has apparently offered Spain diplomatic assurances that Pavlov will not be tortured upon his return, "[a]ssurances of humane treatment from governments that routinely torture are useless," said Julia Hall, criminal justice expert for AI. After a decision by the Council of Ministers, Pavlov will have an opportunity to challenge the legality of his extradition to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], which can require Spain to temporarily stop the extradition.

<p>Kazakhstan has recently drawn international criticism for its human rights record. In November a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-a-court-in-kazakhstan.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of an outspoken opposition leader accused of inciting dissent in an attempt to overthrow the government. In September Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed that oil workers in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. In August HRW urged Kazakhstan to ensure that the trials of Kozlov, another political activist, and an oil worker <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">comport with international legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for fair trials. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-urges-kazakhstan-to-allow-independent-probe-into-december-unrest.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into the December unrest between oil workers and an oil company. In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-demands-kazakhstan-justify-charges-against-political-activists.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan publicly disclose the reason for bringing new charges against a group of labor activists and an oil worker who participated in the December unrest.

While the appellate court did reaffirm the FCC's authority to regulate broadband access under Section 706 of the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.pdf">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> [text, PDF], at issue was whether Internet service providers could charge a company to ensure that customers receive service to that company's website. FCC Chairman <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/leadership/tom-wheeler">Tom Wheeler</a> [official profile] stated:<blockquote>In its <span class="casename">Verizon v. FCC</span> decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit invited the Commission to act to preserve a free and open Internet. I intend to accept that invitation by proposing rules that will meet the court's test for preventing improper blocking of and discrimination among Internet traffic, ensuring genuine transparency in how Internet Service Providers manage traffic, and enhancing competition. Preserving the Internet as an open platform for innovation and expression while providing certainty and predictability in the marketplace is an important responsibility of this agency.</blockquote> The FCC will now <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/19/uk-usa-fcc-internet-idUKBREA1I1RA20140219">develop new rules</a> [Reuters report] to require Internet traffic transparency from service providers and to ensure no unfair limitations upon a consumer's ability to use the Internet. The new rules are expected to be released in late spring or early summer.

<p>Internet providers have challenged the FCC's net neutrality rules in the past. In April 2011 the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-fcc-net-neutrality-rules.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the FCC to dismiss a challenge to the new net neutrality rules. In January 2011 MetroPCS, the fifth-largest cell phone company in the US, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging net neutrality rules. In 2010 the DC Circuit also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the FCC's net neutrality rules in the case of <span class="casename">Comcast v. FCC</span>, holding that the FCC lacks authority to require broadband providers to treat all Internet traffic equally. Following the <span class="casename">Comcast</span> decision, some commentators have <a href="/hotline/2009/09/dc-circuits-ruling-in-comcast-case.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that because providers, and cable operators in particular, have never possessed bottleneck monopoly power previously that the FCC should be more willing to avoid placing restrictions on them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay pointed out that reports of killings and violence are continuing in the CAR and stated that the majority of the human rights violations are being committed by anti-Balaka elements that deliberately target Muslims. Referring to these attacks, Pillay elaborated:<blockquote>The extent of destruction is devastating. Doors, window frames and roofs are burned or removed. Even the walls are being reduced to rubble with the clear aim of discouraging any Muslim from returning. ... The level of cruelty and disregard for life and dignity is horrifying, with public mutilation of bodies, amputation of body parts and genitals, beheadings and at least one case of cannibalism, spreading further terror among the Muslim population.</blockquote>Pillay also expressed concern about anti-Muslim hate speech and encouraged the leaders to remember that they could be held accountable for crimes they order, solicit or induce. 

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital last March. Last week, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ethnic-cleansing-occurring-in-central-african-republic-ai.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to take immediate and effective action to halt the spread of sectarian violence and "ethnic cleansing" within the western part of the CAR. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also in January, the UN reported that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier in January, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December the <a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum, scheduled for November 9, 2014 <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/spain-parliament-rejects-catalonia-secession-push-22596014">was voted down</a> [AP report] by 272 deputies from the country's primary political parties, with  43 votes from Catalonian nationalist groups and other parties in favor. According to The President of the Generalitat of Catalonia <a href="http://www.president.cat/pres_gov/president/ca/index.html">Artur Mas</a> [official website, in Catalan] the referendum <a href="http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/AppJava/notapremsavw/detall.do?id=236549">will contain</a> [press release] a single two part question: "Do you want Catalonia to become a State?" and in case of an affirmative response, "Do you want this State to be independent?"

<p>The fight for <a href="http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/domain-spain-how-likely-catalan-independence">Catalan independence</a> [World Affairs backgrounder] has run concurrently with a recent push for Scottish independence from the UK. In November the <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/">Scottish Parliament</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/scotland-lawmakers-approve-independence-referendum-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to hold a Scottish independence referendum. The bill outlines the <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_Bills/Scottish%20Independence%20Referendum%20Bill/b25as4-amend.pdf">referendum rules</a> [text, PDF]. Both independence opponents and supporters in parliament supported the bill, which will permit a 16-week campaign period and impose financial limits on campaigners to create a level playing field. If Scotland became independent it would have to reapply for <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] membership, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-report-warns-scotland-independence-would-require-reapplication-to-eu.php">report released</a> [JURIST report] in February by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury">HM Treasury</a> [official website], the UK's economic and finance ministry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://legis.sd.gov/Legislators/Legislators/Roster.aspx?Body=H&CurrentSession=True">South Dakota House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill on Wednesday that would prohibit individuals from having abortions based on the gender of the fetus. Representative <a href="http://www.jennahaggar.com/">Jenna Haggar</a> [personal website] is the lead sponsor of the bill, which opponents <a href="http://www.centredaily.com/2014/02/19/4046300/lawmakers-ok-abortion-ban-for.html">argue</a> [AP report] will be impossible to enforce. The bill would make gender-based abortion a Class 6 felony, carrying a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $4,000 fine, for doctors that knowingly perform the abortion. The bill passed on a 60-10 vote and will move to the Senate for a vote. South Dakota already <a href="http://legis.sd.gov/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=34-23A">requires</a> [legislative materials] women seeking an abortion to wait three days after consulting her doctor. Another South Dakota abortion law requires pregnant women to undergo counseling that discourages abortions prior to obtaining one. This law is currently being <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-blocks-parts-of-south-dakota-abortion-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] in federal court. 

<p>There has been much controversy surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. In January the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Center for Reproductive Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/advocacy-groups-sue-to-protect-abortion-access-in-alaska.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Alaska Superior Court challenging a new regulation that seeks to prevent Medicaid from covering elective abortions. In November a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/jurist-the-us-district-court-1.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law regulating abortion facilities. Also in November Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/arizona-ag-asks-us-supreme-court-to-reinstate-abortion-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to reinstate an Arizona law and overturn the holding of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that would strip Medicaid funding from doctors and clinics that perform abortions. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-arizona-race-based-abortion-law.php">dismissed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Arizona's race based abortion laws. In May a federal court struck down the state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">20-week abortion ban</a> [JURIST report]. Some scholars have contended that lawsuits challenging state regulations excluding abortion from comprehensive insurance plans could be the vehicle through which courts can reframe the <a href="/forum/2012/04/mary-ziegler-praeger.php">constitutional basis of abortion rights</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The couples argued that the ban violates their constitutional rights of equal protection and due process. <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1251655436464&ssbinary=true">Amendment 43</a> [text, PDF] of Colorado's state constitution, passed by voters in 2006, defines marriage as being "only a union between one man and one woman." Although the state legislature did pass a law last year which allows for same-sex civil unions, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/20/us-usa-gaymarriage-colorado-idUSBREA1J04C20140220">the lawsuit states</a> [Reuters report] that the legal status granted by the law does not give gay and lesbian couples the same legal status as heterosexual married couples. Four of the couples named as plaintiffs have been legally wed in other states, but because Colorado does not recognize their marital status their relationships are viewed as civil unions by the state. The filing of the lawsuit comes after the striking down of same-sex marriage bans in several other states, including <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/documents/213cv217_memdec.pdf">Utah</a>, <a href="http://www.nmcompcomm.us/nmcases/nmsc/slips/SC34,306.pdf">New Mexico</a> and <a href="http://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/Bostic-Decision.pdf">Virginia</a> [opinions, PDF]. Utah's ruling, as well as a similar one from Oklahoma, are <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25180991/nine-couples-seek-overturn-colorados-marriage-ban">scheduled to be reviewed</a> [<em>Denver Post</em> report] by the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] in Denver.

<p>In November a Colorado same-sex couple<a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-couple-seeks-to-overturn-state-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php"> filed a lawsuit</a> in the Adams Country District Court after they were denied a marriage license from the Adams County Clerk's office in Colorado. In March Colorado <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/governor/">Governor John Hickenlooper</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">signed </a>[JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/35CE5FDC5F040FF487257A8C0050715D?Open&file=011_rer.pdf">Colorado Civil Union Act</a> [text, PDF], which will allow civil unions for same-sex couples in the state. The legislation explicitly provides same-sex couples with many of the benefits held by married couples, including dependent insurance coverage and the ability to adopt a partner's child. Issues surrounding<a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/"> same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US, in light of two recent US Supreme Court rulings regarding same-sex marriage. In<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/"> US v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] the Court overturned Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. The ruling did not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, but it entitles couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages to certain federal benefits. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] the court ruled that the petitioners lacked standing to appeal the district court's order striking down<a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf"> Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's same-sex marriage ban. Legal scholars <a href="/forum/2013/10/theodore-seto-windsor-fallout.php">argue </a>[JURIST commentary] that the recent decisions will open the door to increased litigation due to the rulings' effects on federal and state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/FloorDocs/102/PDF/Slip/LB1161.pdf">LB 1161</a> [text, PDF] was passed by the Nebraska legislature in 2012 and amended the Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act (MOPSA) allowing an alternative method for oil pipeline carriers to seek review and approval of a proposed pipeline route through Nebraska, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nebraska-judge-strikes-down-legislatures-move-allowing-keystone-xl-route/2014/02/19/5601e916-99a7-11e3-b88d-f36c07223d88_story.html">effectively granting</a> [<em>WP</em> report] the state's governor the power to select and approve pipeline routes. Confining her opinion to a determination of the constitutionality of the law, Lancaster County Judge Stephanie Stacy found that the state legislature's stripping of routing power away from its Public Service Commission and granting it to Governor <a href="http://www.governor.nebraska.gov/">Dave Heineman</a> [official website] was a violation of <a href="http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/articles.php?article=IV-20">Article IV section 20</a> [text] of the State constitution. The decision permanently enjoins the state government from "acting pursuant to the Governor's January 22, 2013 approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline route." The defendants in the case, including Heineman, have <a href="https://vipasuite.com/resources/dyn/files/1163065z985f9dcf/_fn/021914+Notice+of+Appeal.pdf?disposition=inline">filed an appeal</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://supremecourt.ne.gov/">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> [official website].  

<p>The proposed Keystone XL pipeline has generated significant controversy. The proposed <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/keystone-xl-map/">expansion</a> [<em>WP</em> report] of the existing Keystone pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of heavy crude oil daily from the tar sand producing regions of Alberta, Canada to refining facilities on the Gulf of Mexico. The planned $5.4 billion pipeline would extend from Alberta to Steele City, Kansas where the XL would tap into the existing pipeline system. In January the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] concluded in its <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline-environmental-impact-statement/789/">final environmental assessment</a> [text] of the Keystone XL pipeline that construction and operation of the pipeline would be unlikely to alter global greenhouse gas emissions. Under US law <a href="http://www.transcanada.com/index.html">TransCanada</a> [official website], the company seeking to build the pipeline, must receive a permit from the US Department of State because the project crosses the US-Canada border. According to the State Department, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-2004-05-10/pdf/WCPD-2004-05-10-Pg723.pdf">Executive Order 13337</a> [text; PDF] grants the Secretary of State "the power to decide whether a project serves the national interest before granting a Presidential Permit." If a Presidential Permit is granted construction of the project can commence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge/Kaplan">Lewis A. Kaplan</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/19/lawyers-allowed-to-question-911-mastermind/5620953/">gave his approval</a> [AP report] in a written order for hundreds of written questions to be submitted to the self-proclaimed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=september+11">September 11</a> [JURIST news archive] mastermind. The interview, according to Abu Ghaith's attorney Stanley Cohen, will help the defense decide whether Mohammad would be an appropriate witness for the trial. In a later hearing, Kaplan expressed skepticism that the defense lawyers had fully explained why questioning Mohammed before the trial was necessary, despite their arguments that he was the most qualified person alive to tell them if Abu Ghaith knew of any al Qaeda terrorist operations. 

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda operatives are making their way through the US judicial system. In April Judge Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-sets-january-trial-date-for-bin-ladens-son-in-law.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] that the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith would take place in January, citing the US budget sequester as the reason for delay. In March Abu Ghaith <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bin-laden-son-in-law-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-of-al-qaeda-involvement.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to conspiracy to kill US citizens. Last January the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">vacated the conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, Osama bin Laden's media secretary. In 2012 Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri<a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php"> pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges. His charges include taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, and conspiring to do such acts. He made his first appearance in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York after being extradited from the UK. Osama Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] by US military personnel in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to air pollution <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/directive.htm">legislation</a> [materials], nitrogen dioxide limits should have been met by January 1, 2010, unless given an extension until January 1, 2015. The directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air in Europe requires member states to remain in compliance with with hourly and annual limit values for nitrogen dioxide. Should a member state's nitrogen dioxide levels fall above those requirements, the state has a duty to create a plan that would minimize the time spent above mandated levels. Though the UK was granted an extension, the requirements provide that the extension will only be granted with countries that have a credible and workable plan for meeting air quality standards by January 1, 2015. Because the UK failed to produce such a plan, the Commission determined that it was in breach of its duties and sent formal notice to the UK. The UK must respond within two months. Nitrogen dioxide, emitted by road vehicles, power generation, industrial activity and other sources, is harmful to the environment and human health. Other parts of Europe are also facing legal action due to their air quality, and the Commission is currently taking action against 17 states in which there are serious air quality problems. The Commission is responsible for ensuring that EU law is applied throughout all member states.

<p>In May 2010 the <a href="http://supremecourt.uk/">UK Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/uk-supreme-court-finds-government-violating-eu-air-quality-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government has been failing to meet EU air quality standards and reached out to the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] for guidance. This was the first time that the court has addressed the problem with air pollution in the UK, which may contribute to as many as <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/01/uk-britain-pollution-idUKBRE9400DQ20130501">29,000 early deaths a year</a> [Reuters report]. The court specifically addressed the violation of the air quality directive concerning nitrogen dioxide, determining that the UK exceeds the limit in 40 out of 43 of its air quality zones. The European Commission decided to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/european-commission-to-pursue-legal-action-against-uk-for-air-pollution.php">pursue legal action</a> [JURIST report] against the UK for air pollution in 2010 after the Commission rejected the UK's request for an exemption of the Greater London Area because it failed to show that it would reach the limit value by 2011. The EC <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/european-commission-launches-actions.php">first launched actions</a> [JURIST report] for clean air law violations in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontprisoncells.jpg" alt="Prison cells" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] New York has agreed to reforms that would reduce the use of solitary confinement and ban solitary confinement for prisoners under 18 years old, according to <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/releases/Solitary_Stipulation.pdf">court documents</a> [opinion, PDF] released on Wednesday. Under the agreement, the state will immediately halt the use of solitary confinement for youth, pregnant inmates, and developmentally disabled and intellectually challenged prisoners. The state will also adopt sentencing guidelines for the first time and set maximum limits on the length of isolation. The reforms come in response to a <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/releases/PeoplesvFischer_Complaint_FINAL.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] filed against the state in December 2012, which alleged that the state was "arbitrarily sentencing tens of thousands of incarcerated individuals to months and years of extreme isolation and solitary confinement for alleged infractions that often present no threat to prison safety." The suit claimed that state solitary confinement policies gave corrections officers wide discretion in imposing isolation and punish a disproportionate number of black prisoners. The suit also alleges that the isolation causes physiological and psychological damage. The findings from the NYCLU's report <a href="http://www.boxedinny.org/library/">"Boxed In"</a> [report, materials] provided the basis for the lawsuit. Lead plaintiff Leroy Peoples, who served 780 consecutive days in isolation for nonviolent behavior after prison officials determined he filed false legal documents, stated that the agreement "is an important step toward dignity and decency." In response to the reforms, the NYCLU has agreed to suspend its lawsuit against the state.

<p>The legality of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=solitary+confinement">solitary confinement</a> [JURIST news archive] has been an ongoing debate in the US, with many calling for comprehensive <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast]. In October UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-us-to-release-prisoner-from-indefinite-solitary-confinement.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to immediately end the solitary confinement imposed in 1972 on <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/cases/usa-the-angola-3">Albert Woodfox</a> [AI backgrounder]. In September Mendez stated in a report to the UN General Assembly that governments should <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/governments-torture-expert-condemns-solitary-confinement-for-juveniles-mentally-disabled.php">ban solitary confinement</a> [JURIST report] for juveniles and prisoners with mental disabilities. Mendez told the assembly members that governments should impose solitary confinement only in exceptional circumstances and for short periods of time. In June at least 400 inmates at Pelican Bay State Prison in California <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/california-inmates-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-solitary-confinement.php">initiated a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] in protest of solitary confinement. Inmates of Pelican Bay's Security Housing Unit (SHU), a long-term isolation ward where one-third of the prison's population is held in solitary confinement, are the instigators of the strike, and most of the strikers from other prisons are inmates in solitary confinement. In January 2011 the Washington Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that holding death row inmates in solitary confinement indefinitely <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/washington-supreme-court-upholds-indefinite-solitary-confinement-for-death-row-prisoners.php">is not an impermissible increase</a> [JURIST report] in the severity of punishment. In 2009, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/aclu-challenges-federal-prison-solitary.php">filed suit</a> against the US government, challenging the establishment of isolated cells within federal prisons that were allegedly created in violation of federal law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Had al Darbi gone to trial, he faced a potential sentence of life imprisonment. However, the plea agreement stipulates that he is to serve no more than 15 more years behind bars, in addition to the 12 years he has already served. Al Darbi will continue to be detained at Guantanamo until he is officially sentenced. After that point, he will likely be transferred to serve the rest of his sentence at a prison in Saudi Arabia. As part of his cooperation with prosecutors, al Darbi is expected to testify in the upcoming case against fellow Saudi detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri </a>[JURIST news archive].

<p>This is the latest in al Darbi's legal proceedings. In 2012, the detainee was accused of numerous <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/jurist-the-us-department-of.php">terrorism charges </a>[JURIST report], including conspiracy, aiding and abetting attacks on civilians, and aiding and abetting terrorism based on his former work as a weapons instructor, contact with Osama bin Laden and support of bombing civilian oil tankers. Al Darbi dodged similar charges in 2009 when the Obama administration contemplated closing Guantanamo Bay. Those proceedings were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/military-judge-grants-further-delay-in.php">delayed several times</a> before being dismissed, but not before al Darbi announced his <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/saudi-guantanamo-bay-detainee-plans.php">plan to boycott</a> [JURIST reports] the military commission as a "sham" and a "crime against humanity." The original <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/military-commission-charges-confirmed.php">two charges were filed in 2008</a> [JURIST report] after it was alleged that al Darbi had formerly conspired in support of terrorism. Al Darbi received his first infamous attention in 2007 when the Department of Defense revealed that he is the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/latest-charged-guantanamo-detainee-is.php">brother-in-law</a> [JURIST report] of Khalid al Mihdar, a 9/11 hijacker.

The controversial surveillance program, which allegedly targets individuals based on religious affiliation, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.muslimadvocates.org/">Muslim Advocates</a> [advocacy website] in June 2012. The Muslim Advocates alleged that the NYPD has engaged in surveillance of Muslim schools, including kindergarten and elementary schools, as well as entire communities, including the Muslim community in Newark, New Jersey. The lawsuit sought injunctive relief barring the NYPD from continuing surveillance operations based solely on religion. The judge dismissed this challenge on the basis that monitoring some members of the Muslim community is a necessary step in monitoring the state for terrorist activity. Additionally, the judge stated that any harm caused to the community was not caused by the state's surveillance, but rather by an AP series that <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/ap-nypd-has-secretly-labeled-mosques-as-terrorist-groups.php">detailed confidential NYPD reports</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The NYPD has come under scrutiny recently for alleged discriminatory surveillance. In September New York City Mayor <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com/">Michael Bloomberg</a> and Police Commissioner <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/administration/headquarters_co.shtml">Raymond Kelly</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/new-york-city-asks-court-to-dismiss-nypd-muslim-surveillance-suit.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that the NYPD spied on mosques and on a Muslim preacher but requesting that the court dismiss the complaint. JURIST guest columnist Samar Warsi in May <a href="/hotline/2012/05/samar-warsi-muslim-surveillance.php">questioned</a> [JURIST comment] the NYPD policies stating: "It is vital to be cautious when government officials use glittering generalities such as 'national security' and 'counterterrorism' to legitimize acts and policies in clear contravention of basic constitutional guarantees." In May New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa concluded that the NYPD's surveillance program <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US#.T8-ZXMXcyDQ">did not violate the Constitution</a> [AP report]. Chiesa had launched an investigation into the program after a series of AP articles sparked outrage in New Jersey in February. In March Raymond Kelly adamantly <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_03_remarks_to_fordham_law_school_alumni.shtml">denied</a> [speech; <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/pr/pr_2012_03_18_ny_times_is_wrong.shtml">press release</a>] that the surveillance programs were unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As of August 2013, Australia transfers all individuals seeking asylum to a holding camp in Papua New Guinea. From here, they are processed and eventually resettled outside of Australia. This detention can be lengthy, as the Australian government assesses the cases. According to Australia, this is meant to deter people-smugglers. However, following violence at the camp in Manus Island that left one individual dead, the OHCHR has called for Australia to reconsider that policy. A spokesperson for the office said of Australia's asylum policy: <blockquote>The practice of detaining migrants and asylum-seekers arriving by boat on a mandatory, prolonged and potentially indefinite basis, without individual assessment, is inherently arbitrary. Moreover, alternatives to immigration detention should always be considered.</blockquote>The violence stemmed from 35 asylum seekers breaking out of the camp followed by rioting the next day. 

<p>Immigration continues to be a contentious issue in Australia. Earlier this month an Australian human rights agency <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/australia-to-investigate-effects-of-detention-on-undocumented-immigrant-children.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] an inquiry into how the government was treating immigrants. In August the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-experts-australia-refuee-detention-a-human-rights-violation.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that Australia's indefinite detention of 46 recognized refugees on security grounds amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In November 2009 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/australia-pm-issues-apology-to-migrant.php">issued an apology</a> [JURIST report] to poor and underprivileged British children who were sent to Australia and other former British colonies over the last century with the supposed intention of giving them a better life, but were instead subjected to childhood of abuse and hard labor. In July 2005 Australia <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/australia-softens-controversial.php">abandoned mandatory detention</a> [JURIST report] for some undocumented immigrants, one of the most criticized provisions of its immigration law, releasing dozens of children. Australia's courts also paved the way for more than 1,000 asylum-seekers to avoid deportation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.doj.state.or.us/Pages/index.aspx">Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum</a> [official website] said in a filing on Thursday that her office will not defend Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage. Rosenblum <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/02/20/six-attorneys-general-wont-defend-their-own-states-gay-marriage-bans/">said</a> [<em>WP</em> report] that the ban cannot survive a federal constitutional challenge under any standard of review. Rosenblum <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/21/us-usa-oregon-gaymarriage-idUSBREA1K02O20140221">went on to say</a> [Reuters report] that there was no rational basis to refuse to honor same-sex marriage commitments the same way the state honors opposite-sex marriages. The <a href="https://www.nationformarriage.org/">National Organization for Marriage</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.nomblog.com/38947/#sthash.lsmE0wSo.dpbs">criticized</a> [press release] Rosenblum for "shamefully abandoning" her duty to defend the laws of the state, not just the laws she agrees with. Rosenblum's decision not to defend Oregon's same-sex marriage ban comes on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/oregon-couples-challenge-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the ban.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges before numerous state and federal courts. Earlier this month Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">declared</a> that her office would no longer be pursuing its legal defense</a> of the state's same-sex marriage ban, stating that recent decisions in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had rendered the state's arguments untenable. In January Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his office will no longer defend legal challenges to the commonwealth's ban on same-sex marriage. In July Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] at a press conference that she will not defend Pennsylvania's statutory ban on same-sex marriage. In 2013 California Attorney General Kamala Harris <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/california-ag-urges-supreme-court-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an amicus curiae brief with the US Supreme Court arguing that the ban on same-sex marriage imposed by the state's Proposition 8 [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+8">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional and should therefore be overturned. In 2012 Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/illinois-ag-files-notice-in-support-of-challenge-to-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] notice with the Cook County Circuit Court stating that her office will present arguments in support of two lawsuits filed in opposition of the state's same-sex marriage ban.<br />

Haitian authorities reopened a criminal case against Duvalier three years ago after he returned to the country from a 25-year exile in France. The charges against Duvalier include murder and torture of political opponents and corruption. However, the case has been stalled for almost a year while a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the statute of limitations had expired. Duvalier assumed the role of president at 19 and ruled for 15 years. During this time, the army and paramilitary forces have been blamed for hundreds of murders and disappearances. Following widespread riots, Duvalier fled to France in 1986, effectively ending his family's rule in Haiti.

<p>The international community has continued to pressure Haiti to move forward in this case. Last month human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/rights-groups-condemn-slow-pace-of-case-against-former-haiti-dictator.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the pace of the proceedings against Duvalier. Last March Duvalier <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-haiti-dictator-appears-before-court-after-fourth-summons.php">appeared before a Haitian court</a> [JURIST report] for the first time after previously rebuffing summonses for alleged human rights abuses from 1971-1986. The lawyer for the plaintiffs criticized the previously rebuffed summonses as evidence of Haiti's failing justice system. The legal proceedings began with Duvalier's lawyer requesting that the proceedings take place behind closed doors. The summons followed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/haiti-court-orders-former-president-duvalier-to-appear-at-human-rights-hearing.php">previous order</a> [JURIST report] by a Haitian appeals court for Duvalier to appear for the hearings, a directive which the ex-president failed to follow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protestors were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/21/anti-kremlin-putin-protesters-guilty-verdict-court">arrested</a> [<em>UK Guardian</em> report] the night before Vladimir Putin's inauguration to his third term as president. At the protest in 2012, police <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/21/russia-convicts-anti-putin-protesters_n_4830312.html">cut off access</a> [AP report] to the public square where the rally was to be held. As a result, protesters began throwing bottles and rocks at the police, and the police ended up detaining more than 400 protesters that night. In response, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/russian-president-signs-controversial-protest-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a controversial bill that greatly increased the penalty for protesters who violate demonstration regulations. When the court convicted the eight protesters on Friday, the police detained about 200 protesters for attempting to violate public order outside of the courthouse. Boris Nemtsov, an opposition leader, believes that all eight protesters will receive jail time for their convictions. Nemtsov said that the trial was politically motivated.

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently. In November a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/russia-court-allows-government-to-seize-assets-of-putin-critic.php">ruled</a> that the Russian government could seize the assets of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of Putin, after Navalny was charged with money laundering and theft.In October a Russian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/russia-court-upholds-opposition-leaders-conviction-suspends-sentence.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Navalny's embezzlement conviction but suspended his five-year jail sentence, allowing him to walk free. In June the UN released a letter from human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-concerned-russia-ngos-being-unfairly-targeted-by-prosecutors.php">voicing their concern</a> [JURIST report] that two Russian non-governmental organizations have been charged by Russian prosecutors following their involvement with the UN Committee against Torture. In May a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/russia-court-rejects-appeal-by-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by members of the feminist punk group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">Pussy Riot</a> [JURIST news archive] against their sentence for a protest against Putin. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The men, aged 88, 92 and 94, are currently being <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26282592">detained</a> [BBC report] in the Hohenasperg prison hospital. They are being charged as accessories to murder, an example set by the successful <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/germany-arrests-auschwitz-guard-suspects-22596013">prosecution</a> [AP report] of John Demjanjuk, the first individual to be convicted in Germany on the basis of being a guard at a Nazi concentration camp. This is the latest development in Germany's renewed efforts to bring justice to Nazi-era war criminals, and comes five months after German prosecutors announced that it would be opening investigations into about 30 suspected former Nazis. Following the arrests several other raids were executed, reportedly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/germany-auschwitz-guards-arrests-raids">discovering</a> [AFP report] a significant amount of Nazi-era documents.

<p>German officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] several investigations into Nazi-era war criminals after the<a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php"> conviction </a> [JURIST report] of Demjanjuk in 2011. Most recently on January 8, 2014 German officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/germany-court-drops-case-against-92-year-old-former-nazi.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] they would be dropping charges against Siert Bruins, a former member of the Nazi Waffen SS accused of executing a Dutch resistance fighter in 1944, citing gaps in the available evidence. That same day German officials announced that murder charges had been <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/germany-prosecutors-charge-former-nazi-with-murder.php">filed </a> [JURIST report] against another former Nazi, identified only as "Werner C" for his alleged involvement in a 1944 massacre in southern France. He is accused of having murdered 25 individuals personally, and aided his fellow SS members in the murders of another 642. In August 2013 the German prosecutor specializing in Nazi era war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/germany-prosecutor-auschwitz-investigation-almost-complete.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the office's Auschwitz investigations were nearly complete.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was jointly <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20140220arizona-controversial-religion-bill-could-land-brewer-desk.html">written</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] by the conservative <a href="http://www.azpolicy.org/">Center for Arizona Policy</a> and the <a href="http://www.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> [advocacy websites], a Christian legal organization. The voting occurred largely along party lines, with state Republicans generally voting in favor of the bill. It will now go to Governor Jan Brewer, who will have five days to sign the bill into law. The Arizona House Minority Leader released a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/press/House/51leg/2R/PR-CAMPBELL_1062.DOC.htm&Session_ID=112">statement</a> [text] on Thursday urging Brewer to veto the bill, stating that it unfairly targets the LGBT community and promotes extremism and discrimination. The Arizona <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/21/us-usa-gays-arizona-idUSBREA1K06M20140221">reportedly</a> [Reuters report] stated that the bill is "unnecessary and discriminatory," has nothing to do with God or faith, and simply allows businesses and private individuals to use religion as a means to discriminate.

<p>LGBT rights continue to be a divisive issue both in the US and abroad, with the primary focus on the rights of such individuals to <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">marry</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In January four Arizona same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/arizona-couples-file-lawsuit-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriages. In December a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] Utah's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, and a similar decision was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/new-mexico-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] by the New Mexico Supreme Court just a few days previously, following an August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-mexico-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal.php">order</a> [JURIST report] to district court clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In June 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal statute defining marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman that precluded same-sex couples legally married under state law from receiving federal benefits afforded to heterosexual couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote followed Yanukovich's statement that he would not be resigning despite current escalating violence. At least 25 individuals <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kiev-explodes-into-chaos-at-least-25-reported-dead-in-ukraine-protests/2014/02/19/aacecc60-9967-11e3-b88d-f36c07223d88_story.html">have been reported dead</a> [WP report] and more than 240 injured, in protests that escalated when individuals began a march on Parliament in opposition of Yanukovich. The protests began peacefully in November, but became violent after the now repealed protest laws increased police power in cracking down on demonstrators. There will be an election in May to determine Yanukovich's replacement. His removal is aimed at achieving a peaceful resolution to the protests.

<p>Ongoing protests in Kiev have continued for more than two months, prompting reactions from all sides of the conflict. This week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-officials-urge-peaceful-resolution-to-ukraine-crisis.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a peaceful resolution. Earlier in February leaders of Ukraine's anti-government protests <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-opposition-calls-for-constitution-change.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Yanukovich for further concessions, including a return to the earlier constitution that would limit presidential powers, and a revival of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/facilitating-trade/free-trade/">EU free trade agreement</a> (FTA) [existing EU FTAs]. In January the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Right</a>s (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters. The statement came the day after Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">offered amnesty to protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested and agree to meet certain conditions.<br />

The <a href="http://www.opcw.org/">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> (OPCW) [official website] set the deadline for all Syrian chemical weapons to be destroyed by June 30. While the OPCW did not comment on the plan, several organizations are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/21/us-syria-crisis-chemicals-idUSBREA1K1D220140221">critical</a> [Reuters report] of the delay.

The OPCW <a href="http://www.opcw.org/news/article/director-general-need-to-pick-up-pace-in-removing-chemicals-from-syria-1/">reported</a> [press release] that two shipments of Syria's chemical weapons have been made within the month of January, however, that the disposal process must be completed faster. Syria has admitting to possessing 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for almost three years. The conflict has been highlighted by countless human rights violations and use of chemical weaponry, which has created mounting pressure among the international community to find an end to the conflict. In February, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-syria-un-rights-experts.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that both sides have been committing human rights violations. The day before, Syria <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/syria-signs-agreement-to-dispose-of-chemical-weapons.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to dispose of their chemical weapons. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to the Security Council, which highlights the severe suffering faced by children in Syria during the period between March 2011 and November 2013. The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have killed and tortured extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children, as well. </p>]]></content:encoded>

At least 25 individuals have been reported dead and more than 240 injured in protests that escalated when individuals began a march on Parliament to oppose Yanukovich. The protests began peacefully in November, but became violent after the now-repealed protest laws increased police power by cracking down on demonstrators. On Saturday, the <a href="http://iportal.rada.gov.ua/en/news">Ukrainian parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-votes-to-remove-president.php">voted to remove</a> [JURIST report] President Viktor Yanukovich. The vote followed Yanukovich's statement that he would not be resigning despite current escalating violence. 

<p>Ongoing protests in Kiev have continued for more than two months, prompting reactions from all sides of the conflict. This week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-officials-urge-peaceful-resolution-to-ukraine-crisis.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a peaceful resolution. Earlier in February leaders of Ukraine's anti-government protests <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-opposition-calls-for-constitution-change.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Yanukovich for further concessions, including a return to the earlier constitution that would limit presidential powers, and a revival of the EU free trade agreement (FTA). In January the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters. The statement came the day after Yanukovich <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">offered amnesty to protesters</a> [JURIST report] who were arrested and agree to meet certain conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2013, the security council <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/U.N._may_extend_eased_Somalia_arms_embargo_despite_concerns_-_diplomats.html?cid=37999938">voted to partially lift</a> [Reuters report] the embargo, allowing the Somalian government to purchase small arms to defend against Islamist forces. This year, reports indicated that the Somalian government was abusing the less restrictive embargo by diverting weapons to militants linked to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Sources report that the eased restrictions are set to expire in early March, whereupon the fully restrictive embargo will go back into force without UN intervention. The security council reportedly plans to continue parts of the less restrictive embargo, while increasing reporting requirements for certain arms purchases. 

<p>The illegal flow of weapons to militant groups continues to be an international problem. In February 2009 Amnesty International (AI) called for the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-calls-for-arms-embargo-on.php">place an arms embargo</a> [JURIST report] on Israel and Hamas, responding to the UN's report that both parties used foreign-supplied weapons during the recent fighting in Gaza. The UN found that weapons from more than 20 countries were used during the Gaza conflict, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of children and other civilians. In December 2008 the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-bans-alleged-terrorist-front-group.php">added</a> [JURIST report] the name of a Pakistani charity seen as a front for the group being blamed for the Mumbai terror attacks to its list of entities subject to asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo as a terrorist organization. In November 2008 former Argentine President Carlos Menem was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/argentina-court-formally-charges-ex.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] with illegally trafficking arms to Croatia and Ecuador, contrary to a 1991 UN embargo against Croatia and a 1995 Organization of American States (OAS) ban on selling arms to Ecuador. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 2-1 decision, the federal court affirmed a lower court's ruling that denied Notre Dame's request for a temporary injunction from the federal health law's contraception requirement. Notre Dame argued that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] compromise allowing religiously-affiliated nonprofits to let third party insurance companies Aetna and Meritain provide birth control to students and employees is inadequate, because it forces the university to comply with something it believes to be immoral. The PPACA allows religiously-affiliated nonprofits to opt out of paying for contraception, but requires them to send forms alerting a third party insurer that will have to pay. The government will then reimburse the third-party administrator's costs. "What does Notre Dame want us to do?" said Judge Richard Posner, writing for the majority.<blockquote>We imagine that what the university wants is an order forbidding Aetna and Meritain to provide any contraceptive coverage to Notre Dame staff or students pending final judgment in the district court. But we can't issue such an order; neither Aetna nor Meritain is a defendant. ... Furthermore, while a religious institution has a broad immunity from being required to engage in acts that violate the tenets of its faith, it has no right to prevent other institutions, whether the government or a health insurance company, from engaging in acts that merely offend the institution.</blockquote>After failing to win the injunction, Notre Dame instructed its insurance plan administrator to inform school employees that they are eligible for the separate contraception arrangement while the full legal challenge continues in court. 

<p>Laws regulating contraception have been subject to various challenges at both the federal and state level. Last month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-grants-contraceptive-mandate-exemption.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] enjoining the US Department of Health and Human Services from requiring that the Little Sisters, a Roman Catholic order, fill out a formal government document in order to secure exemption from the PPACA contraceptive mandate. Also last month, an Oklahoma state court judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/oklahoma-judge-blocks-emergency-contraception-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the state's emergency contraception law unconstitutional. In November a divided three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ppaca-contraceptive-mandate-unconstitutional-dc-circuit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the contraceptive mandate imposed by the PPACA violates the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. In October the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-health-care-law-contraception-mandate.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] claims by Eden Foods that it should be exempt on religious grounds from the contraception mandate PPACA. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/third-circuit-rules-business-cannot-challenge-birth-control-mandate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Friday that family-owned, profit-making businesses cannot challenge the new federal health care law's birth control mandate on religious grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A group of UN independent experts on Saturday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14190&LangID=E">called on </a>[press release] the government of Iran to halt the startling increase in the number of hangings since the start of 2014. According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OFCHR) [official website], at least 40 persons were hanged in the beginning of January 2014, and 625 executions were reportedly carried out in 2013. "We are dismayed at the continued application of the death penalty with alarming frequency by the authorities, despite repeated calls for Iran to establish a moratorium on executions," Independent experts Ahmed Shaheed and Christof Heyns said. While majority of the executions were for those convicted of drug-related offenses, a number of individuals were executed for 'enmity against God' or alleged acts against national security. "I would like to recall once again that, if the death penalty is to be used at all in countries which have yet abolished it, international law requires that it may be imposed only after proceedings that met the highest level of respect of fair trial and due process standards," said Christof Heyns. "The government of Iran has legal and moral obligations to respect the right to life, which is the most fundamental of all human rights." 

<p>Iran's harsh death penalty policy and treatment of prisoners has been questioned by human rights groups. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/iran-has-executed-40-people-in-two-weeks-claims-amnesty-international.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Iran executed 40 people in the first two weeks of 2014, and called on the government of Iran to abolish the death penalty. In January 2013, UN human rights experts called for Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-experts-urge-iran-not-to-execute-ahwazi-activists.php">halt the executions</a> [JURIST report] of five Ahwazi activists condemned on charges of "enmity against God, corruption on earth and causing propaganda against the government". The UN General Assembly in November 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-committee-expresses-concern-for-human-rights-in-iran.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over human rights violations in Iran that include hanging as a method of execution, public executions, and executions of minors. In October 2012 Iran <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/10-executed-in-iran-despite-pleas-by-human-rights-groups-ai.php">executed ten members of drug smuggling gangs</a> [JURIST report] despite pleas by the UN and Amnesty International to stay executions for non-violent crimes. Iran has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">accused of "execution binging"</a> [JURIST report] as far back as January 2011 when the <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [advocacy website] claimed they were "executing one prisoner every eight hours".</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reports indicate that first-time offenders will face up to 14 years in prison, while those charged with "aggravated homosexuality" will face life in prison. The law also requires Ugandans to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/world/europe/ugandan-president-to-sign-antigay-law.html?_r=0">report homosexual activity</a> [NYT report] to the authorities or face criminal sanctions. Homosexuality has long been illegal in Uganda, but parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/uganda-parliament-passes-antigay-legislation.php">passed this measure</a> [JURIST report] in December to impose harsher penalties on homosexual activity. Ugandan authorities have reportedly rationalized the law, notwithstanding international disapprobation, based upon the need to protect the nation's youth and general population from the "emerging internal and external threats to the traditional heterosexual family." Museveni previously <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uganda-president-refuses-to-sign-anti-gay-legislation.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] the bill as too harsh and sought a compromise with parliament.

<p>The bill's history has garnered international attention since it was passed in December, and many see it as a reaction to major legislative reforms in support of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US and other Western nations.

After US District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman's ruling, which only applies to Cook County, <a href="http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/Pages/default.aspx">Cook County Clerk David Orr</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/newsroom/newsfromclerk%5CPages/Same-sexmarriagelicensestobeissuedimmediatelyinCookCounty.aspx">announced</a> [press release] that marriage licenses would begin to be issued immediately at the downtown Bureau of Vital Records and that they would be available at all offices starting Monday. Marriage licenses are valid for 60 days, and the $60 license fee will be waived for couples already in possession of an Illinois civil union license. Coleman's order <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-21/news/chi-judge-same-sex-couples-can-marry-now-in-cook-county-20140221_1_mercedes-santos-theresa-volpe-marriage-licenses">did not address</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] converting prior civil union dates to marriages, however, so couples wishing to do so will have to wait until June.

<p>In November a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-allows-illinois-same-sex-couple-to-marry.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Cook County Clerk to immediately issue a marriage license to same-sex couple Vernita Gray and Patricia Ewert, who had petitioned for an immediate marriage license due to Gray's battle with terminal breast cancer. Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Recently several state attorney generals have <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">declined to defend</a> [JURIST report] their states' same-sex marriage bans. Last week the Indiana Senate approved a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-amendment-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">prohibit same-sex marriage in the state</a> [JURIST report]. If given final legislative approval the measure will go before voters in 2016.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Amid protests over suspected <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/turkey-tightens-control-over-judiciary-201421514231731579.html">government corruption and violence inside parliament</a> [Al Jazeera report] the ruling <a href="http://www.siyasetakademisi.org/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] pushed the bill though parliament, thereby granting the Justice Ministry greater control over the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HSYK) [official website]. The law comes amid growing controversy that has forced high-level officials, including members of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's cabinet, to <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">resign</a> [JURIST report]. The law also stems from the arrests of the sons of the interior minister and two other cabinet members in relation to the corruption investigation. The controversy has sparked protests, to which police have responded with force. Since the graft scandal broke, the Turkish government has transferred or dismissed thousands of police officers and hundreds of judges and prosecutors. 

<p>In February the Turkish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-tighten-internet-restrictions.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation to heighten Internet restrictions, granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without the court's approval. In December Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 10 new members of his cabinet following the resignation of three members under investigation for graft. The controversy has highlighted some of the issues surrounding Turkey's judicial system. Also in December a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-court-rejects-release-of-detained-kurdish-lawmakers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] bids to release two members of the parliament for the Kurdish Peace and Democratic Party (BDP), Gulser Yildirim and Ibrahim Ayhan. Yildirim and Ayhan have been detained since 2010 when they were each charged with links to the militant <a href="http://www.pkkonline.com/en/">Kurdistan Workers Party</a> (PKK) [party website]. This decision came after Turkey's top court <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/152694/lengthy-detentions-39-unconstitutional-39-turkey-39-s-top-court-rules.html">ruled</a> [Turkish Weekly report] that the long-term detention of another member of parliament of the opposing party pending trial was in contradiction to the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his statement, Avakhov said that an official case had been opened for the mass murder of peaceful citizens and that Yanukovich and other officials <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26320004">had been declared wanted</a> [BBC report], going on to say that Yanukovich was last seen in the Crimean peninsula before dismissing much of his security detail and going to an unknown location.

A vast majority of Ukraine's elected parliament voted for the new government, including members of Yanukovich's party, and acting President Oleksandr Turchinov has said that a new coalition government may be formed as soon as Tuesday. 

<p>The Ukrainian parliament on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-votes-to-remove-president.php">voted to remove Yanukovich</a> [JURIST report] from office following a statement from the president that he would not be resigning despite current escalating violence. Ongoing protests in Kiev have continued for more than two months, prompting reactions from all sides of the conflict. Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-officials-urge-peaceful-resolution-to-ukraine-crisis.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for a peaceful resolution. Earlier in February leaders of Ukraine's anti-government protests <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-opposition-calls-for-constitution-change.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Yanukovich for further concessions, including a return to the earlier constitution that would limit presidential powers, and a revival of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/facilitating-trade/free-trade/">EU free trade agreement</a> (FTA) [existing EU FTAs]. In January the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters.

The Supreme Court denied the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/022414zor_19m2.pdf">petitions</a> [order list, PDF], two of which were filed by the <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website], without opinion. In <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C11/11-10959-CV0.wpd.pdf">NRA v. Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ban-on-selling-handguns-to-minors.php">report</a>], the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] upheld a law prohibiting federally licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to anyone under the age of 21. In <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Natl_Rifle_Assn_of_America_Inc_v_McCraw_719_F3d_338_5th_Cir_2013_">NRA v. McCraw</a> [opinion], the Fifth Circuit affirmed a Texas statutory scheme that prohibits 18-20-year-olds from carrying firearms in public. Finally, in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Lane_v_Holder_703_F3d_668_4th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">Lane v. Holder</a> [opinion], the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] held that the plaintiffs lacked <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to challenge a federal regulation restricting interstate transfers of hand guns. Paul Clement, who filed one of the appeals on behalf of the NRA, expressed frustration that the Supreme Court has been reluctant to hear Second Amendment cases since 2008, when it struck down a Washington, DC, gun ban in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have been litigated in federal court. In January a federal district court in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's new <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">gun control law</a> [JURIST report]. That same month a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/chicago-gun-sales-ban-ruled-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] part of Chicago's gun ordinance banning the licensed sale of firearms in the city. Also in January a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-most-of-new-york-gun-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] most of state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">new gun control law</a> [JURIST report], among the most restrictive in the country, but struck down a provision prohibiting owners to load more than seven rounds into a magazine. In May 2013 a group of Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">filed a federal law suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a series of gun control laws <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1146_nk5h.pdf">United Air Regulatory Group v. EPA</a> [transcript, PDF], which was consolidated with six other cases, the court has limited the grant of review to the following issue: Whether the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF] for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases. Stationary sources are typically electricity-generating utility plants and major factories, and the permitting requirements in question involve the EPA's authority under the Clean Air Act's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/title1.html">Title I</a> and <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/title5.html">Title V</a> [texts] to issue permits for construction or modification and operation of stationary sources. In the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website], a three judge panel <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Coalition_for_Responsible_Regulation_Inc_v_EPA_684_F3d_102_401_US">upheld</a> [opinion, text] the EPA's determination that greenhouse gases were an endangering pollutant that the EPA was obliged to regulate. The DC Circuit court declined to review the decision <em>en banc</em>, and the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-to-rule-on-greenhouse-gas-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] last October.

<p><span class="casename">United Air Regulatory Group v. EPA</span> is not the only <a href="/dateline/2013/11/jordan-asch-environmental-law.php">controversial case</a> [JURIST op-ed] involving the EPA and the Clean Air Act crossing the Supreme Court's agenda. In December the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-hears.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the consolidated cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1182_0pl1.pdf">Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation and American Lung Association v. EME Homer City Generation</a> [transcript, PDF]. There, the court is considering the authority of the EPA under the Clean Air Act to issue a regulation limiting power plants' emissions that cross state lines. The questions before the court are (1) whether the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the challenges on which it granted relief; (2) whether states are excused from adopting state implementation plan (SIPs) prohibiting emissions that "contribute significantly" to air pollution problems in other states until after the EPA has adopted a rule quantifying each state's interstate pollution obligations; and (3) whether the EPA permissibly interpreted the statutory term "contribute significantly" so as to define each upwind state's "significant" interstate air pollution contributions in light of the cost-effective emission reductions it can make to improve air quality in polluted downwind areas, or whether the act instead unambiguously requires the EPA to consider only each upwind State's physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind air quality problem. JURIST Guest Columnist John Robinson Jr. <a href="/dateline/2014/01/john-robinson-environmental-law.php">examined</a> [JURIST op-ed] the consolidated cases and the EPA's efforts to address cross-state air pollution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protesters were <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/21/anti-kremlin-putin-protesters-guilty-verdict-court">arrested</a> [<em>Guardian report</em>] the night before Vladimir Putin's inauguration to his third term as president. At the protest in 2012, police <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/21/russia-convicts-anti-putin-protesters_n_4830312.html">cut off access</a> [AP report] to the public square where the rally was to be held. In response, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/russian-president-signs-controversial-protest-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a controversial bill that greatly increased the penalty for protesters who violate demonstration regulations. Hundreds of supporters crowded the courthouse yard to condemn the Kremlin's restriction of opposition. When the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/anti-kremlin-protestors-convicted-in-russia.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] the protesters on Friday, the police detained about 200 individuals for attempting to violate public order outside of the courthouse. More than 400 more protesters were then detained on Monday for holding a rally outside the Kremlin. The seven individuals have been in custody awaiting trial for almost two years. Evidence in court consisted mainly of police testimony and rally video footage. The eighth defendant in the case received a suspended sentence and remains under house arrest. 

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently. In November a Moscow court ruled that the Russian government could <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/russia-court-allows-government-to-seize-assets-of-putin-critic.php">seize the assets</a> [JURIST report] of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of president. In October a Russian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/russia-court-upholds-opposition-leaders-conviction-suspends-sentence.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Navalny's embezzlement conviction but suspended his five-year jail sentence, allowing him to walk free. In June the UN released a letter from human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-concerned-russia-ngos-being-unfairly-targeted-by-prosecutors.php">voicing their concern</a> [JURIST report] that two Russian non-governmental organizations have been charged by Russian prosecutors following their involvement with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CAT/Pages/CATIndex.aspx">UN Committee against Torture</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, the Secretary-General urged all parties involved to respect human rights, and to communicate openly in order to advance reform. He offered his readiness to assist in any way possible to prevent future attacks. 

<p>Thailand has been embroiled in severe political turmoil since November when protesters took to the street to contest the government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13723451">Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile].

In January Suthin Thararin, a protest leader for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PDRCThailand">People's Democratic Reform Committee</a> (PDRC) [Facebook page], was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">shot to death</a> [JURIST report] in front of the Sri Eiam Temple in Bangkok while demonstrators blocked a voting station. The shooting came just five days after the Thai government<a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php"> declared</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency, granting it broad powers to curtail the political unrest, including the ability to censor media, impose a curfew and detain suspects without charges. These powers are in addition to those granted in November when the prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-prime-minister-invokes-special-security-law-amidst-protests.php">invoked</a> [JURIST report] a special security law known as the Internal Security Act, which conferred broader powers on police forces attempting to contain the protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These reasons <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2014/02/24/Putin-clamps-down-tighter-on-NGOs/UPI-12131393258089/?spt=rln&or=1">include</a> [UPI report] allegations of extremism and suspected violations of the law, and the inspections may be ordered by the heads of authorized agencies, or requested by prosecutors and election commissions. According to the Russian <a href="http://minjust.ru/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Russian], of the 6,947 NGOs inspected in 2013, only 206 of the audits were <a href="http://rapsinews.com/legislation_news/20140224/270797196.html">unscheduled</a> [RAPSI report].

Since the NGO law <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-activists-to-appeal-ngo-law-to-europe-rights-court.php">took effect last November</a> [JURIST report], Russian activists have vowed to challenge it.

The amendment was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-virgina-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] by federal judge Arenda Wright, but the ruling was stayed until after the government's appeal could be heard. Virginia <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/">Attorney General Mark Herring</a> [official website] has stated his opposition to the ban, but claims the appeal will "ensure that higher courts can swiftly rule on the critical issues in this case."

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community.

The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/convictions-italians-thrown-cia-case-22653121">five agents</a> [AP report] included the former chief of Italy's <a href="http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/">SISMI Intelligence service</a> [official website, in Italian], Nicolo Pollari, his deputy, and three other agents. Pollari was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/milan-court-convicts-italian-spy-chief-for-role-in-cias-extraordinary-rendition-program.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by a Milan court of appeals in February 2013 to 10 years in prison. Court officials did not offer public comment on the judgment, but Italian news sources <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/24/us-italy-cia-idUSBREA1N1HY20140224">reported</a> [Reuters report] the Italian agents could not be prosecuted because of state secrecy laws. Monday's ruling could affect the upcoming trials of three Americans, who were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/italy-court-convicts-3-americans-for-2003-rendition-kidnapping.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] within one week of Pollari last February for their role in the kidnapping and rendition of Nasr. The Americans' appeal is scheduled for March 11 in the Court of Cassation.  

<p>The rendition of Nasr has resulted in substantial judicial activity in Italy. In December 2013 an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/italy-court-convicts-egyptian-cleric-of-terror-charges.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Nasr to six years in prison after being convicted <em>in absentia</em> of terror charges. Last September a former Italian intelligence chief <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-cia-chief-requests-pardon-from-italy-president.php">requested a pardon</a> from <a href="http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/ex-presidenti/Napolitano_1/nap-biografia1.htm">Italian President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official website, in Italian] after a US Air Force Colonel was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/italy-pardons-us-colonel-in-cia-extraordinary-rendition-case.php">granted a pardon</a> in April from Napolitano [JURIST reports]. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-judge-convicts-23-former-cia.php">original convictions</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 arose out of a three-year trial, in which 23 former CIA agents were sentenced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kasonkomona, a well-known activist for LGBT rights in highly-conservative Zambia, where homosexuality is illegal, was arrested in April 2013 after speaking out on a television program for "soliciting in a public place for immoral purposes." The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26342543">magistrate found</a> [BBC report] that the state had failed to make a sufficient case against Kasonkomona and he was released. The ruling is seen as a victory for gay rights in Africa in the wake of increasing anti-homosexuality legislation.

<p>Homosexuality is illegal in about 40 countries in Africa. Uganda, in particular, is facing controversy over a recently passed law that strengthens harsh penalties for homosexuality to include life in prison.

Citing an alleged failure of domestic authorities to properly investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes, Pillay reportedly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/25/us-srilanka-un-rights-idUSBREA1O0YZ20140225">stated</a> [Reuters report] that an independent international inquiry is necessary to bring perpetrators to justice. While expressing concern over the lack of investigation into crimes committed during the conflict, Pillay also brought attention to crimes that have perpetuated past the end of the conflict including violence against women and religious minorities. Sri Lankan authorities have <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/southasia/2014/02/sri-lanka-rejects-call-war-crimes-probe-20142254460713165.html">rejected</a> [Al Jazeera report] the calls for international inquiry, defending their country's own processes. President Mahinda Rajapaksa issued a set of comments to Pillay's report, reportedly referring to the recommendations for inquiry as, "arbitrary, intrusive and of a political nature." This report comes in advance of a UN Human Rights Council debate in March, where the US is expected to introduce resolutions against Sri Lanka to put pressure on the government to comply with any investigation attempts.

<p>An advance copy of the report was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] to the Sri Lankan government on February 16 without any immediate response. This came just three days after the United National Party, Sri Lanka's main opposition group <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/sri-lanka-opposition-party-demands-domestic-war-crimes-investigation.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a statement demanding a domestic investigation into war crimes perpetrated on both sides of the conflict. On February 5 an independent report by the Australian legal advocacy group Public Interest Advocacy Center was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/investigation-reveals-possible-war-crimes-in-sri-lanka.php">released</a> [JURIST report] detailing reports of bombing civilian targets, extrajudicial executions, denial of humanitarian aid, and sexual violence.

The report accused state officials of ordering law enforcement officers to use improper suppression measures, including improper use of physical force, illegal detention, torture of prisoners, use of water cannons in near-freezing temperatures and other extreme measures. The resolution further alleged the use of "organized criminal groups" to attack, kidnap, torture, kill, and destroy the property of individuals based solely on their political beliefs, calling the actions "unprecedented." However Ukraine is not a signatory to the ICC's empowering treaty, and so the court has no automatic jurisdiction there unless the government formally <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/02/25/ukraine-crisis-icc-idINDEEA1O09720140225">invites</a> [Reuters report] their involvement. Then prosecutors for the court will determine whether to proceed with an investigation. Once an investigation is begun Ukraine will have no say over who is investigated or prosecuted.  

<p>Yanukovich was last seen in the Crimean peninsula after state officials on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ousted-president.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a warrant for his arrest, implicating him in the "mass murder" of civilians during the recent protests. The Ukrainian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-votes-to-remove-president.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday to remove him from power, after his repeated refusals to resign in response to the escalating violence. There has been substantial international concern over the mounting crisis in the country, on February 19 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made a statement <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-officials-urge-peaceful-resolution-to-ukraine-crisis.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] both sides of the conflict to reach a peaceful resolution and end the violence. This followed a January 31st statement by the office that <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for an investigation of allegations of torture against protesters. A day earlier the Verkhovna Rada passed a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">granting</a> [JURIST report] conditional amnesty to many protesters, a move that failed to conciliate the opposition groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report is based on 12 leaked official documents going back to 1993, which reveal explicit government policies imposing restrictions on movement, marriage, childbirth, home repairs and construction of houses of worship, and other aspects of everyday life for the Rohingya. Additionally, confidential enforcement guidelines empower security forces to use abusive methods to implement "population control" measures. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26333580">basis for discrimination</a> [BBC report] by the Buddhist-majority government against the Rohingya Muslims is the official recognition of the Rohingya as foreign migrants, not citizens, and a general fear that the Muslim family size may overcome the Buddhist majority in the country.

<p>A history of domestic prosecution of the Rohingya in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar</a> [JURIST news archive] is well publicized, but Tuesday's report is the first time that official document evidence has been released, according to the executive director of Fortify Rights Matthew Smith. In January a team of UN humanitarian experts led by <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valerie Amos</a> [official website] called for an immediate investigation into alarming levels of violence in the Rakhine state last month, which resulted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25866350">killings</a> [BBC report] of at least 40 Rohingya Muslims. Also last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-thailand-must-end-trafficking-of-rohingya-asylum-seekers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to end human trafficking of Rohingya asylum-seekers. Last October the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/asiaregion/pages/mmindex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar</a> [official website], Tomas Ojea Quintana, <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-conflict-in-rakhine-continues-to-inspire-sectarian-violence-in-myanmar.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that sectarian violence is contributing to wider anti-Muslim sentiments in Myanmar, threatening the positive changes undertaken by the country in the past two years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

California</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that police may search a home without a warrant over the objection of one occupant if that occupant has been removed from the premises. The Court of Appeals of California <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8926647036229045680&amp;q=People+v.+Fernandez,+208+Cal.App.4th+100&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39">concluded</a> [opinion] that Supreme Court precedent established in 2006 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15354777432474595853&amp;q=georgia+v+randolph&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39">Georgia v. Randolph</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/supreme-court-limits-police-searches.php">report</a>] "does not require exclusion of the evidence obtained in the warrantless search of defendant's home." In a majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the court agreed:<blockquote>In this case, we consider whether <em>Randolph</em> applies if the objecting occupant is absent when another occupant consents. Our opinion in <em>Randolph</em> took great pains to emphasize that its holding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is physically present. We therefore refuse to extend Randolph to the very different situation in this case, where consent was provided by an abused woman
well after her male partner had been removed from the apartment they shared.</blockquote>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas filed concurring opinions. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. One of the main issues in this case was whether defendant's objection barred his wife from giving a valid consent to the police to search the defendant's home without a warrant. The defendant argued that his objection to search cannot be nullified by his subsequent arrest because it would create possibilities of state abuse. The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-adds-5-cases-to-next-years-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case last May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fiore</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that when the conduct of the defendant, a Georgia police officer, occurred entirely in Georgia, the mere fact that his conduct affected plaintiffs with connections to Nevada does not authorize jurisdiction over him in Nevada. The decision overturns the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Fiore_v_Walden_688_F3d_558_9th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion/1">concluded</a> [opinion] that the Constitution permitted courts in Nevada to exercise jurisdiction over a deputized Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who lived and worked in Georgia and seized money from a pair of Nevada gamblers connecting through the Atlanta airport. Gina Fiore and Keith Gipson were traveling to Nevada. They were searched in a layover in Atlanta, Georgia, where their money was seized as evidence of drug transactions. The money was actually legal gambling winnings, but Fiore and Gipson sued the Georgia law enforcement agent in Nevada. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether due process permits a Nevada court to exercise jurisdiction in this case. Citing <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/444/320/case.html">Rush v. Savchuck</a> [opinion], the court ruled that no matter how significant plaintiff's contacts with the forum may be, those contacts cannot be "decisive in determining whether the defendant's due process rights are violated." Moreover, the minimum contacts test looks to the defendant's contacts with the forum state itself, not the defendant's contacts with persons who reside there. Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jurisdiction-labor-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] for the case in November. Counsel for Walden argued that the "plaintiff-centered approach is inconsistent with this Court's precedence which emphasize that the defendant himself must have meaningful contacts with the forum State." The Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-jurisdiction-venue.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This announcement comes in the wake of two massive data breaches at major retailers Target and Neiman Marcus late last year. <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/story/retailers-can-wait-tell-you-your-card-data-have-been-compromised">Accusations</a> [NPR report] that the companies reported their breaches with undue delay raised questions about how quickly businesses should be required to notify their customers. Holder, lamenting that this type of crime is "becoming all too common," stated that the Department of Justice is working closely with the US Secret Service and the FBI to investigate cybercrimes and asserted that a national standard requiring quick reporting of such crimes "would empower the American people to protect themselves if they are at risk of identity theft" and "would enable law enforcement to better investigate these crimes." Holder also wants the proposed legislation to address the accountability of businesses who fail to keep their customers' personal and financial information safe while providing exemptions for responsible businesses that may experience "harmless breaches."

<p>Holder's proposed legislation is the latest effort on the federal level to reduce the prevalence of identity theft in the US. Although approximately <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/story/retailers-can-wait-tell-you-your-card-data-have-been-compromised">46 states</a> [advocacy website] have data breach notification standards, they vary in how much time they require companies to notify customers of such breaches. In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ola/witness/02-04-14-cmr-raman-testimony-re-privacy-in-the-digital-age-preventing-data-breac.201427115.pdf">statement</a> [text] before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman, pushing for the new federal legislation, reported "cybercrime has increased dramatically over the past decade" resulting in the access and exploitation of the personal information of others. Raman warned of millions of Americans potentially falling victim to identity theft every year. On February 12, President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/12/statement-president-cybersecurity-framework">stated</a> [press release] that "cyber threats pose one of the gravest national security dangers that the United States faces." He went on to announce the launch of the "Cybersecurity Framework," a guide for companies to control cyber risk. The Framework is the result of a year-long effort of the <a href="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> [official website] working closely with the private sector to educate organizations and businesses on best practices and standards to "better manage cyber risk" to our country's economy. The <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=42">Bureau of Justice</a> [official website] defines identity theft "as the unauthorized use or attempted use of existing accounts ... or personal information to open a new account or for other fraudulent purposes" and reports that roughly "seven percent of persons age 16 or older were victims of identity theft in 2012." The majority of these incidents were the result of stolen credit card or bank account information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [transcript, PDF]. The case addresses the issue of whether a defendant who owes restitution for a fraudulently obtained loan returns a portion of the loan money by giving the lenders the collateral property that secures the money. Petitioner Benjamin Robers submitted fraudulent loan documents for two houses that materially misrepresented his income and ability to repay loans. Robers eventually defaulted on the two mortgages, and the houses were foreclosed and resold for less than the value of the mortgages. Robers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3663A">Mandatory Victims Restitution Act</a> (MVRA) [18 USC &#167;3663A, text], must pay restitution equal to the difference between the amount of money he fraudulently took from the banks and the amount of any property he returned to the lenders. Both the lower court and the Seventh Circuit held that under the MVRA, Rober must pay restitution equal to the difference in value between the mortgages and the actual sale price. 

<p>Counsel for Robers argued in front of the Supreme Court that the amount owed in restitution should be based on the appraised value of the homes on the date of the foreclosure rather than their value on the date that the lenders sold the properties. In response, the government argued that the MVRA "focuses on ... how much of the property that was lost has been returned to the victim before sentencing." According to the government, the property lost was the money lent due to Rober's fraudulent mortgage, and so restitution should be valued when the houses are sold and money is returned to the victim: "When the property that was lost was a car, you don't get an offset for returning pineapples. When the property that was lost was money, you don't get an offset for returning the house." </p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitutionally entitled to contest a grand jury's finding of probable cause underlying a pre-trial seizure of assets. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=677+F.3d+1316&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=13470602727197466954&scilh=0">ruled against</a> [opinion] the availability of such hearings because "defendants are not entitled to try the entire case twice," before the trial and then again in front of a judge and jury. The Supreme Court was asked to consider whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendments</a> [text] give a defendant the right to challenge the evidentiary support of the underlying charges in a pre-trial adversarial hearing when a post-indictment, ex parte restraining order freezes assets needed by a criminal defendant to retain counsel of choice. Relying on precedent, the Court found that the freeze placed on the Kaleys' money is valid because "a defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to spend another person's money for legal fees."  "The grand jury gets to say&#8212;without any review, oversight, or second-guessing&#8212;whether probable cause exists to think that a person committed a crime," Justice Elena Kagan wrote, affirming the Eleventh Circuit's ruling for the majority.<blockquote>If the question in a pre-trial forfeiture case is whether there is probable cause to think the defendant committed the crime alleged, then the answer is: whatever the grand jury decides. ... Congress of course may strike its own balance and give defendants like the Kaleys the kind of hearing they want. ... But the Due Process Clause, even when combined with the defendant's Sixth Amendment interests, does not command those results.</blockquote>
Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, dissented: "few things could do more to 'undermine the criminal justice system's integrity' than to allow the Government to initiate a prosecution and then, at its option, disarm its presumptively innocent opponent by depriving him of his counsel of choice&#8212;without even an opportunity to be heard."]]></content:encoded>

In November a Moscow court ruled that the government could <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/russia-court-allows-government-to-seize-assets-of-putin-critic.php">seize Navalny's assets</a> [JURIST report]. Charges for theft and money laundering were filed in October against Navalny and his brother. No trial date has been set, but the penalties include up to 10 years imprisonment for theft and money laundering. Navalny has criticized the charges as an improper attempt to silence people who dissent from the governmental authority. The seizure of assets occurred in connection with those charges. Investigators are accusing both men of defrauding two firms, a cosmetic firm and a cargo delivery firm, of more than 30 million rubles combined. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Apple argues that the case management order that brought the case together in the Southern District of New York only applied to pretrial activity. They suggest that the class action should be moved to Northern California where it originated in 2011, and that the state action should be moved to the Western District of Texas where it is based. The brief states, "The [New York] Court never entered an order consolidating the class actions and States' action for any purpose other than pretrial proceedings." The brief also criticizes last year's ruling, stating that the judge's finding was a "radical departure" from modern anti-trust law that will "chill competition and harm consumers" if allowed to stand. Apple is currently set for a May 2014 trial for damages, which could amount to approximately $840 million.

<p>Apple has been defending itself in a lawsuit over anti-trust violations <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/10/us-apple-ebooks-idUSBREA191YP20140210">brought</a> [Reuters report] by 33 state attorneys general and class action attorneys representing consumers from 16 states. Earlier this month, the Second Circuit court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-appeals-court-denies-apples-motion-to-block-antitrust-monitor.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Apple requesting a temporary hold on the duties of the court appointed external compliance officer Michael Bromwich. This ruling came a month after Apple <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/apple-seeks-to-disqualify-compliance-monitor-in-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">sought to disqualify</a> [JURIST report] Bromwich for exceeding his mandate. Bromwich was installed by Judge Cote of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in October. In addition to installing Bromwich, Cote had also <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-judge-issues-injunction-against-apple-in-e-book-price-fixing-case.php">entered an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Apple in September, preventing the company from future anti-trust violations in connection with e-book price fixing. This all comes on the heels of a July <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/federal-judge-finds-apple-guilty-of-e-book-price-fixing.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by Cote, who found that Apple violated the Sherman Act and various state statutes in an e-book price fixing conspiracy. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] accused Apple of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/turkeys-president-approves-law-tightening-grip-judiciary-102556181--finance.html">new law</a> [Reuters report] grants the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.tr">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] greater control over the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HSYK) [official website, in Turkish], an independent body responsible for appointing members of the judiciary. The bill was signed into law amidst <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/news-339715-turkey-to-bid-farewell-to-rule-of-law-if-president-approves-hsyk-law.html">rising controversy</a> [Today's Zaman report] since the law was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-approve-bill-increasing-control-over-judiciary.php">approved by parliament</a> [JURIST report] on February 15. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-pass-bill-increasing-control-over-judiciary.php">given final parliamentary approval</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week and has sparked protests over suspected government corruption. The main opposition <a href="http://www.chp.org.tr/en/">Republican People's Party</a> (CHP) [party website] is expected to file a challenge to the law in <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr">Turkey's Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Turkish]. 

<p>Turkish lawmakers have been on the defensive in recent months as the government faces allegations of corruption and authoritarianism. In February the Turkish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-president-approves-controversial-internet-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation to heighten Internet restrictions, granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without the court's approval. In December <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Prime Minister Recep Tayipp Erdogan </a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 10 new members of his cabinet following the resignation of three members under investigation for graft. Also in December a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-court-rejects-release-of-detained-kurdish-lawmakers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] bids to release two members of the parliament for the Kurdish Peace and Democratic Party (BDP), Gulser Yildirim and Ibrahim Ayhan, who have been detained since 2010 when they were each charged with links to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). </p>]]></content:encoded>

The police reported Begg is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/25/four-arrested-birmingham-suspicion-syria-terror-offences">suspected</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]  of attending a terrorist training camp and facilitating terrorism overseas.

Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer affirmed the Fifth Circuit's holding that the SLUSA does not preclude the plaintiffs' state-law class action suits because the certificates of deposit sold by Stanford International Bank does not a "covered security" within the meaning of the Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Samuel Alito. 

<p>The Supreme Court's ruling is the latest legal development arising out of Stanford's Ponzi scheme. In August a federal judge in Florida <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-against-sec-over-stanford-ponzi-scheme.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] over the agency's alleged failure to report Stanford's Ponzi scheme to the <a href="http://www.sipc.org/">Securities Investor Protection Corporation</a> (SIPC) [official website]. In June 2012 Stanford was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/financier-stanford-sentenced-to-110-years-for-ponzi-scheme.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 110 years in prison for his Ponzi scheme.

The lawsuit includes two same-sex couples; one wishing to marry in the state of Texas and the other seeking to have Texas recognize their prior marriage, which took Massachusetts. Judge Orlando Garcia granted the couples' preliminary injunction enjoining the state from enforcing the ban on same-sex marriage on the grounds that the ban violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it deprives same-sex couples of their fundamental rights without furthering any legitimate interests. Garcia is the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/texas-gay-marriage-ban-struck-down">sixth federal judge</a> [MSNBC report] to strike down a state ban on same-sex marriage since the US Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report] last summer, which invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). 

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the american legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. Earlier this week Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-appeals-ruling-against-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal ruling against the state's same-sex marriage ban. Last week Oregon's Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] her intention not to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court. Since July attorneys general in <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Nevada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Pennsylvania</a> [JURIST reports] have made similar decisions not to defend bans on same-sex marriage. Also last week, a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-allows-same-sex-marriage-licenses-in-cook-county-illinois.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same sex couples in Cook County could be issued marriage licenses immediately, rather than wait until June, when the state's same-sex marriage law goes into effect. A federal judge in Kentuckey <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-must-recognize-same-sex-marriages-performed-out-of-state.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that the state must recognize valid out-of-state same-sex marriages. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Apel</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1382">18 USC &#167; 1382</a> [text], which prohibits a person from reentering a military installation after a commanding officer has ordered him not to reenter, may be enforced on a portion of an installation that is subject to a public roadway easement and that contains a designated protest area. A protester, John Apel, was barred from a military base in California, but continued to protest on a public roadway on government-owned land outside the entrance. He was convicted of three counts of trespassing. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] reversed Apel's convictions. Wednesday's Supreme Court decision, which was delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, effectively vacated that of the Ninth Circuit. The court held:<blockquote>Where a place with a defined boundary is under the administration of a military department, the limits of the "military installation" for purposes of &#167;1382 are coterminous with the commanding officer's area of responsibility. Those limits do not change when the commander invites the public to use a portion of the base for a road, a school, a bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the commander reserves authority to protect military property by, among other things, excluding vandals and trespassers.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, as did Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The case is now on remand to the district court.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-military-protest-case.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in December. Apel's attorney argued that the federal statute in fact was applied only if there is exclusive federal possession. He further noted that any other interpretation would infringe upon an individual's First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court however continuously advised the respondent's counsel to focus on the easement issue rather than the First Amendment. Justice Antonin Scalia noted that respondent's counsel keeps "sliding into the First Amendment issue, which is not the issue on which we granted certiorari. We're only interested in whether the statute applies." Apel's counsel claimed that the US wants the benefit of having an easement so that the state would be responsible for maintenance and liabilities while assuming control over the public road as it would within the base. However, he argued that "[o]nce they've created a public road, once they've created a designated protest zone, it is different, functionally, than the rest of the base."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay reported that since December, these attacks have killed more than 40 individuals, four of whom were children. Also of concern is the fact that buildings such as hospitals, clinics and schools have been shelled during some of these attacks. Although Yemeni forces have claimed that they have been attacked by armed groups, Pillay responded that these claims "can never justify the use of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks." Another area of concern involved the non-action of the investigation committee that was established by President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in response to the December 27 <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-condemns-deadly-drone-strike-in-yemen.php">shelling of a funeral procession</a> [JURIST report] that killed 21 Yemeni civilians and injured 30 others. Pillay urged the committee to release any findings and recommendations that resulted from its investigation. Also noted was the fact that approximately 50,000 Yemeni civilians are currently in need of humanitarian assistance, and additionally that a number of civilians may be trapped in various towns due to ongoing violence. Pillay called on commanders to ensure that troops respect international law, and called on Yemeni authorities to allow UN agencies immediate access in order to deliver humanitarian aid, as well as to ensure that civilians wishing to leave conflict areas are safely able to do so.

<p>The UN and other advocacy organizations have repeatedly urged the Yemeni government to investigate possible human rights violations and to reform the country's laws in accordance with international human rights standards. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] in November called on Yemen's National Dialogue Conference (NDC) to <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/hrw-urges-yemen-to-rescind-immunity-law.php">endorse proposed legislation</a> that would strike down a 2012 law <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">providing blanket immunity</a> [JURIST reports] to former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13179385">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ali+Abdullah+Saleh">news archive</a>]. The new legislation would allow Saleh to be prosecuted for any crime, including any human rights violations. HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-urges-yemen-to-include-womens-rights-in-constitution.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the NDC in September to incorporate stronger protections for women's rights into its new constitution. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-yemen-to-stop-executing-juvenile-offenders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to stop seeking and enforcing the death penalty for juvenile offenders. The group accused the Yemeni government, which has the fifth highest number of executions in the world, of executing at least 15 individuals since 2007 for crimes committed while under the age of 18. HRW also <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-yemen-failed-to-probe-anti-government-protester-deaths.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Yemeni authorities in February for failing to investigate top officials for the shooting deaths of 45 anti-government demonstrators who were killed in March 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Oleg Makhnytsky <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-requests-international-arrest-warrant-yanukovych-164116565.html">reported</a> [AFP report] that the former president was "the subject of an international arrest warrant." It is unknown at this time whether Ukrainian officials have additionally made a formal request to Interpol for Yanukovich's arrest. Meanwhile, the current interim government is expected to be formally approved by the Ukrainian parliamentary body <a href="http://rada.gov.ua/en/">Verkhovna Rada</a> [official website] on Thursday, and <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-protesters-nominate-legislator-pm-203850776.html">interim leaders have proposed</a> [AP report] that Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who has formerly served as economy minister, foreign minister and parliamentary speaker, become Ukraine's new prime minister. 

<p>Ukraine's interim officials have rapidly worked to alter the state of affairs within the government in the few days since Yanukovich fled from Kiev. The Ukrainian parliament voted on Tuesday to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-parliament-votes-to-send-ousted-president-before-icc.php">adopt a resolution</a> [JURIST report] referring Yanukovich and other high-ranking state officials to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Yanukovich was last seen in the Crimean peninsula after state officials on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ousted-president.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a warrant for his arrest, implicating him in the "mass murder" of civilians during the recent protests. The Ukrainian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-votes-to-remove-president.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday to remove him from power, after his repeated refusals to resign in response to the escalating violence. There has been substantial international concern over the mounting crisis in the country, and on February 19 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made a statement <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-officials-urge-peaceful-resolution-to-ukraine-crisis.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] both sides of the conflict to reach a peaceful resolution and end the violence. This followed a January 31 statement by the office that <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into allegations of torture against protesters. A day earlier the Ukrainian parliament passed a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ukraine-parliament-passes-amnesty-law-for-protesters.php">granting</a> [JURIST report] conditional amnesty to many protesters, a move that failed to conciliate the opposition groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Brewer's decision has been <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/issues/press-releases/2014-02/4420">applauded</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website].

<p>LGBT rights continues to be a divisive issue, both in the US and abroad, with the primary focus being on the <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">right of same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Also Wednesday a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Texas' same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional. In January four Arizona same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/arizona-couples-file-lawsuit-to-overturn-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn the state's constitutional ban on same-sex marriages. In December a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] Utah's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, and a similar decision was <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/new-mexico-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] by the New Mexico Supreme Court just a few days prior, following an August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/new-mexico-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-legal.php">order</a> [JURIST report] to New Mexico district court clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal statute defining marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman, and which precluded same-sex couples legally married under state law from receiving federal benefits afforded to heterosexual couples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also regulates electronic cigarettes for the first time. Electronic cigarettes will have to comply with packaging and advertising rules, and makers of e-cigarettes will also have to notify EU member state governments prior to introducing new products. Makers of e-cigarettes will also report annual sales volumes to their EU member state. EU lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/european-lawmakers-approve-new-regulations-on-smoking.php">approved draft versions</a> [JURIST report] of the new regulations in October. The warning labels will include graphic pictures and text and cover the front and back of the package. The law also bans smoking tobacco products with flavors, although the menthol flavor will not be phased out until 2020. 

<p>The EU is not the first to face the issue of graphic warning labels for cigarette packagining. In August 2012 the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that requires cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and bans brand logos. In the US, there is debate over the constitutionality of graphic cigarette warning labels. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] graphic warnings in August 2012, holding that the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration's</a> (FDA) [official website] rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the agency's statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy. However, in March 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sixth-circuit-upholds-cigarette-warning-labels.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [opinion, PDF] of graphic cigarette warning labels, ruling that portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] is a valid restriction of commercial speech and also upheld the FDA's regulations requiring more prominent graphic health warning labels on packaging struck down in an earlier ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Octane prevailed in federal district court but was <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Icon_Health__Fitness_Inc_v_Octane_Fitness_LLC_496_Fed_Appx_57_Fed">denied attorneys' fees</a> [opinion, PDF] by the Federal Circuit Court, which affirmed that the suit was not "exceptional" because it held that, absent litigation or patent misconduct, attorneys fees would only be granted if a patent holder brought an "objectively baseless" claim in "subjective bad faith." Octane <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/246465_Brief.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF] for <em>certiorari</em>, and the Supreme Court granted the petition in October.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-1163_iieq.pdf">Highmark v. Allcare Health Management Systems</a> [transcript, PDF], the Supreme Court is considering whether a district court's finding that a patent case is exceptional based on its judgment that a suit is "objectively baseless" is entitled to deference in higher courts. <a href="http://www.allcarehealthsystems.com/privacy.aspx">Allcare Health Management Systems</a> notified <a href="https://www.highmark.com/hmk2/index.shtml">Highmark</a> [corporate websites] of patent infringement concerning a method of data entry and management used in medical treatment situations. Highmark then sought a declaratory noninfringement judgment and Allcare counterclaimed. Highmark prevailed in the district court and then moved to be granted attorneys' fees for  an exceptional cases. The district court granted attorneys' fees for two of the claims, but the Federal Circuit Court <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Highmark_Inc_v_Allcare_Health_Mgmt_Sys_Inc_687_F3d_1300_104_USPQ2">reviewed the claims <em>de novo</em></a> [opinion, PDF] and reversed one of awards.

Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Karlsruhe court</a> [official website, in German] ruled on Wednesday that the 3% voting threshold for political parties to enter the the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] is unconstitutional. The German government lowered the voting threshold from 5% to 3% last year, but the top court <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26351565">ruled</a> [BBC report] by a 5-3 vote that it should be abolished altogether. The ruling will allow smaller parties like the far-right Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), Free Voters, Pirates and Ecological Democratic Party to obtain seats in the May 2014 election. Most countries in the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] do not have a voting threshold in place, but eight member states retain a threshold. The court reasoned that the threshold was no longer necessary in order to preserve the European Parliament's ability to function. If there had been no threshold in the last election, the far-right NPD would have gained a seat in the European elections. NPD has been accused of <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/german-high-court-judge-revives.php">promoting neo-Nazi ideals</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Besides Germany, several countries have faced issues dealing with neo-Nazi movements and propaganda. In 2013 an Austrian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/austria-court-convicts-three-neo-nazis-for-glorifying-nazism.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three neo-Nazis of glorifying Nazism over the Internet, sentencing them to as many as nine years in prison. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial/Tribunal_Supremo?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court of Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/spain-high-court-overturns-convictions-of-Nazi-propaganda-disseminators.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of four individuals charged with distributing neo-Nazi propaganda, reasoning that disseminating Nazi ideology is not a crime unless used to incite violence or certain danger, or create a hostile climate. In July 2010 a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-jails-neo-nazis-for-hate-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 neo-Nazis, including a group leader and several teenagers, to jail terms for committing hate crimes against ethnic minorities in the country. Also in 2010 a criminal court in France <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-court-convicts-neo-nazi-group.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of a neo-Nazi group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Frank Rosenow <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-germany-president-trial-idUSBREA1Q16V20140227">informed the court</a> [Reuters report] of Wulff's acquittal, saying that there was insufficient proof that the former president had accepted illegal payments. Wulff, who has insisted on his innocence since his resignation in 2012, chose to clear his name at trial rather than settle out of court. Prosecutors argued that Wulff, who was premier of the state of Lower Saxony at the time of the alleged offense, allowed a filmmaker to pay for his hotel stay and meals during a visit to the Oktoberfest beer festival in 2008, amounting to about 719 euros, and that he agreed to lobby to provide financial support for a film in exchange. The favors that led to the corruption charges were accepted two years before he began his 20-month presidential term.

<p>In November Wulff <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/germany-ex-president-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in Hanover, denying allegations of corruption. German <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/DE/Startseite/startseite_node.html">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website, in German] selected Wulff to fill the largely ceremonial role of president in 2010. In 2011 German media sources accused Wulff of accepting a &#8364;500,000 (USD $650,000) low interest home loan from the wife of German businessman Egon Geerkens. Wulff reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17072479">gave false statements</a> [BBC report] about the loan in front of parliament, leading to his resignation in February 2012. Corruption has been an issue in Germany in the past. In 2007 Germany <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/germany-to-toughen-anti-corruption-law.php">introduced draft legislation</a> [JURIST report] to tighten anti-corruption laws on the heels of scandals at Volkswagen AG and Siemens AG. The law sought to increase public prosecutors' power to investigate corruption of a broader range of implicated employees, and to allow employees of foreign corporations to be indicted in Germany.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit alleges that the plaintiffs and their relatives <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26340359">were taken</a> [BBC report] to Japan where they were forced to work in coal mines during the War. According to the BBC, the top Japanese government spokesman <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/meibo/daijin/suga_e.html">Yoshihide Suga</a> [official profile] has stated that there are no issues of liability for Japanese companies because of the 1972 <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint72.html">Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China</a> [text] establishing diplomatic ties between both countries. 

<p>The Chinese court's decision to hear this case is the most recent episode in a fight for compensation that has been going on for decades.

The lawsuit, originally filed in 1999, sought nearly seven million dollars in compensation from the Chinese government and six companies. Also in 2007 a Japanese district court <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/japan-court-denies-compensation-to-wwii.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] demands for compensation by 22 South Korean women, as well as the surviving relatives of other women, who were forced to work at a Japanese military hardware factory during World War II.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egypt's Cairo Criminal Court convicted 26 people on Wednesday charged with forming a terrorist group with the intent to attack the <a href="http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/">Suez Canal</a> [official website]. The group was charged with planning attacks on ships in the Suez Canal as well as security buildings, foreign tourists, Christians and police. Most of the defendants <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/egypt-sentences-26-death-alleged-suez-plot">received</a> [AP report] death sentences and tried in absentia, but it is likely they will receive a retrial when arrested. One of the present defendants was younger than 18, and thus did not receive a death sentence. In 2012 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-court-sentences-14-islamists-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 militants to death on similar charges of attacks on police and civilians in the Sinai Peninsula. Eight of the fourteen are still in prison and the rest were tired in absentia. 

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. On Tuesday Egypt's Prosecutor General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-refers-muslim-brotherhood-members-for-mass-criminal-tribunal.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] 504 members of the Muslim Brotherhood for a mass trial. Earlier this month Egypt's deposed president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/morsi-trial-adjourned-after-brief-court-appearance.php">appeared</a> in court in his <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Morsi-to-stand-trial-for-espionage.php">trial</a> [JURIST reports] for espionage and conspiring to commit acts of terrorism. Morsi's trial signifies Egypt's political transition from the authority of the Muslim Brotherhood into a new regime. Morsi appeared before the court earlier this month, but the trial was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/trial-of-ousted-egypt-president-resumes.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] to give a committee of media members time to inspect video evidence the court declassified for the trial. In recent months, hundreds of members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been convicted on criminal charges, with <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-court-convicts-113-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-in-three-trials.php">113 supporters sentenced</a> in January, and <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-court-sentences-139-protesters-in-mass-trial.php">139 sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI's investigation was specifically focused on the evidence of the unlawful shootings of 22 Palestinian civilians by Israeli soldiers. The shootings arose from the Palestinians' continuing <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/trigger-happy-israel-s-use-of-excessive-force-in-the-west-bank">protests</a> [AI report] against the Israeli government for their occupation of Palestinian territories and illegal construction of a barrier within the West Bank. With this report, AI is urging the Israeli government to open investigations into the wrongful killings of these Palestinians in order to seek a remedy for the possible violations of both Israeli and international law.      

<p>Israel has been criticized recently for potential human rights violations, particularly with respect to the conflict in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaza">Gaza</a> [JURIST news archive] and the West Bank. Recently the UN has <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/israel-to-cease-use-of-live-ammunition-against-civilians-un.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] for Israeli forces to cease its use of live ammunition against civilians that may constitute excessive use of force in the West Bank. In December <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] accused the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes.php">Israeli Defense Forces of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] after a November aerial bombing raid killed 12 civilians in Gaza. In response, UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found in favor of appellant Cindy Lee Garcia, reversing a US District Court's denial of Garcia's request for an injunction to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/actress-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-anti-islam-film-film-from-youtube.php">remove the film</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-19572912">Innocence of Muslims</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Garcia, who appears in the film, says her performance was intended for a different film, but her voice was dubbed over with an anti-Islamic epithet and incorporated into <em>Innocence of Muslims</em>. The film soon garnered worldwide news coverage accompanied by violent anti-American <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-court-sentences-8-christians-to-death-in-symbolic-trial-over-anti-islam-film.php">protests</a> [JURIST report] throughout the Middle East. An Egyptian cleric ordered the deaths of everyone involved with the film, and Garcia began receiving death threats. Garcia sought removal of the film, claiming the posting "infringed her copyright in her performance." Google argued that an injunction would violate its First Amendment right to free speech, to which the appeals court responded, "the First Amendment doesn't protect copyright infringement" and since Garcia will likely succeed on her pending copyright claim and risks "irreparable harm" without an injunction, the "balance of equities and the public interest favor her position."

<p>Since its release in July 2012, <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has generated considerable unrest in the Muslim world accompanied by serious tensions between the US and Middle East. The film, depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a fool and a womanizer, enraged many of the world's faithful Muslims and led to violent <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/26/uk-google-youtube-film-idUKBREA1P1H920140226">protests</a> [Reuters report] in Egypt, Libya and other Middle East countries as well as Asia and Africa. The unrest included an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/doj-files-first-criminal-charges-in-attack-on-us-diplomatic-mission-in-libya.php">killing</a> [JURIST report] US Ambassador Christopher Stevens along with three other Americans. Earlier this month, Thomas Joscelyn of the <a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org">Foundation for Defense of Democracies</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/HM/HM05/20140211/101734/HHRG-113-HM05-Wstate-JoscelynT-20140211.pdf">testifying</a> [text, PDF] before a House Committee hearing on Al Qaeda's expansion in Egypt, stated that the film was used "as a pretext for terrorism." Joscelyn stated that "multiple known al Qaeda actors seized upon the ...  video as a pretext to justify protests and assaults on US diplomatic facilities." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Following his February 12 <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/KYMarriage.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF], <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> Judge John Heyburn also <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026804579409391467921838?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304026804579409391467921838.html">granted</a> [AP report] a request to allow additional couples seeking full marriage rights to intervene in the case. In response, the state <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/209672911/Beshear-Conway-request-stay-in-ruling">filed</a> [text] a stay of his order pending any appeal, requesting that the court stay the effective date granting relief for 90 days. According to Heyburn's prior ruling, Kentucky's <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/233a.htm">constitutional amendment</a> [text] defining marriage as between "one man and one woman" is a violation of <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/intro.htm">Kentucky law</a> [text] and the Equal Protection Clause under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution since the language treats same-sex couples "differently in a way that demeans them." Kentucky <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/bio/Pages/default.aspx">Attorney General Jack Conway</a> [official website] has 30 days to determine whether to file an appeal of the decision. The <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-rules-kentucky-must-recognize-same-sex-marriages-performed-out-of-state.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] makes Kentucky the tenth state to strike down same-sex marriage bans.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. Earlier this week a judge for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a similar Texas constitutional amendment violates the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process. Also this week Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-appeals-ruling-against-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal ruling against the state's same-sex marriage ban. Last week Oregon's Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] her intention not to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court. Since July attorneys general in <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Nevada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Pennsylvania</a> [JURIST reports] have made similar decisions not to defend bans on same-sex marriage. Also last week, a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-allows-same-sex-marriage-licenses-in-cook-county-illinois.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same sex couples in Cook County could be issued marriage licenses immediately, rather than wait until June, when the state's same-sex marriage law goes into effect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the preface to the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013, Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">John Kerry</a> [official website] wrote that the DOS will "continue to press governments to uphold fundamental freedoms. We remain committed to advocating on behalf of civil society and speaking out for the protection of human rights for all individuals." The preface also highlighted some of the major human rights violations and existing legislative restrictions, calling attention to Syria, Russia, China, Ukraine, Cuba, Egypt and South Sudan. The introduction to the report recognizes that there have been important human rights developments in the following areas: civil society and the freedoms of association and assembly; free expression and press freedom; security force abuses; labor rights; and vulnerable groups, such as religious and ethnic minorities, women and children, LGBT persons and communities, and persons with disabilities. The human rights violations occurring as a result of the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian war</a> [JURIST backgrounder] were mentioned as standing apart from the rest of the major developments due to their scope and human cost. Other notable mentions include: consequences of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arab+spring">Arab Spring</a>; anti-activist suppression in countries such as China and Cuba; establishment of the rule of law in <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a>, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burma+political+prisoners">release of political prisoners in Myanmar</a>, and Russia's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gay+rights+russia">anti-LGBT legislation</a> [JURIST news archives and backgrounders. The report was submitted to the Congress by the DOS in compliance with Sections 116(d) and 502B(b) of the<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-32"> Foreign Assistance Act of 1961</a> (FAA) [text].

<p>The DOS issues its yearly reports on human rights practices to Congress under a legal mandate [22 USC &#167; 2151n] and has filed similar reports for 2012, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-state-department-releases-2011-annual-rights-reports.php">2011</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">2010</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">2009</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">2008</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">2007</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/rice-says-us-allies-among-worst-human.php">2006</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/us-rights-reports-name-north-korea.php">2005</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/state-department-raps-middle-east.php">2004</a>, 2003, <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/state-department-human-rights-reports.php">2002</a> [JURIST reports] and previous years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is charged with unsanctioned protest, inciting chaos and resisting arrest. Beyond these charges, Navalny was already serving a jail sentence for protests earlier this week and is accused of embezzlement. The latest arrest came in connection with anti-corruption protests against the conviction anti-Kremlin activists. Opponents of the ruling claim this is yet another attempt by the Russian government to silence one of its more vocal opponents.

The ruling was based on Lipschis' early stages of incipient dementia, making him unable to comprehend the criminal trial. While Lipschis acknowledges being a member of the SS at Auschwitz, he maintains he only served as a cook and is not guilty of any war crimes. Lipschis was deported from the US in 1983 for lying about his Nazi affiliations when immigrating to the US. Prosecutors charged Lipschis with 10,500 counts of accessory to murder. The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/german-court-rules-former-auschwitz-guard-unfit-for-trial.php">released</a> [JURIST report] Lipschis in December based on these preliminary concerns, but has now made its final determination. Lipschis' prosecution has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/german-court-rules-auschwitz-guard-suspect-unlikely-fit-for-trial/article15803558/">progressed further</a> [AP report] than most prosecutions of former Nazi members in German courts.

<p>German courts have been willing to extend the charge to those found to have worked in death camps since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction of John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST report] in 2011. Lipschis was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in May. Despite the ages of the accused, German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the holocaust. Like Lipschis, Demjanjuk was also deported from the US. Demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in prison but was released early due to old age and died in September 2011 while <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/accused-hungary-nazi-dies-while-awaiting-appeal.php">awaiting an appeal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month the court ruled that the San Diego law violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Harris criticized the opinion saying, "Local law enforcement must be able to use their discretion to determine who can carry a concealed weapon." Harris also promised to do everything in her power to restore the law enforcement's discretion. The California state law requires individuals to show good cause, and allocates the authority to local law enforcement to grant and deny permits based on good cause. If the Ninth Circuit's opinion takes effect, officials throughout the state may have to abandon the good cause requirement for granting permits. 

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have been litigated in federal court. Earlier this month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-gun-rights-cases.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] three new petitions that would address the scope of the Second Amendment. In January a federal district court in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's new <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">gun control law</a> [JURIST report]. That same month a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/chicago-gun-sales-ban-ruled-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] part of Chicago's gun ordinance banning the licensed sale of firearms in the city. Also in January a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-most-of-new-york-gun-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] most of state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">new gun control law</a> [JURIST report], among the most restrictive in the country, but struck down a provision prohibiting owners to load more than seven rounds into a magazine. In May 2013 a group of Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">filed a federal law suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a series of gun control laws <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In an <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14292&LangID=E">official statement</a> [press release], Pillay expressed serious concern at the amount of violence that has taken place since the unrest began, as officials have reported 13 deaths and another 140 injuries since the beginning of the conflict. Pillay urged the government of Venezuela to respect freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, stating: <blockquote>The inflammatory rhetoric from all sides is utterly unhelpful and risks escalating the tense situation in the country... It is time for all sides to move beyond verbal aggression and towards meaningful dialogue. This crisis will only be resolved if the human rights of all Venezuelans are respected.</blockquote>It is unclear whether the Venezuelan government will respond to Pillay's plea.

<p>The statement by Pillay comes only two weeks after the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-office-calls-for-peaceful-resolution-of-venezuela-protests.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] all parties involved in the protests to open dialogue to resolve the situation in response to three deaths that had occurred earlier that week. Such violent demonstrations have been partially motivated by Venezuela's current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25745959">economic difficulties</a> [BBC backgrounder] and disdain towards current <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.ve/gobierno_presidente.html">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official website, in Spanish]. In September Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/venezuela-withrdraws-from-international-human-rights-court.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights despite criticism from activists and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-high-commissioner-asks-venezuela-to-stay-in-human-rights-court.php">calls by the UN</a> [JURIST report] for the country to remain a member. In August the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/venezuela-supreme-court-dismisses-presidential-election-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by candidate Henrique Capriles challenging the results of the presidential election that placed Maduro as the successor to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a> [JURIST news archive]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

On Cinco de Mayo 2010, a teacher at <a href="http://liveoakhs.ca.campusgrid.net/home">Live Oak high School</a> [school website] asked for certain students to remove their American Flag t-shirts or leave school due to ongoing hostility between white and Mexican students. The administrators and teachers justified this action with the argument that students were in danger and that physical conflict could erupt. The federal appeals court ruled that the school's actions were not unconstitutional, finding that administration acted properly under the reasonable belief that their students' safety was in question. The court also ruled that the school was allowed to target only students with American flag t-shirts with the understanding that a school may confront any student who wears a  symbol that could cause significant disruptions to the educational environment.

<p>First Amendment rights of students remain a controversial issue. In 2011 the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that schools <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-rules-schools-cannot-punish-students-for-speech-outside-school.php">cannot punish students</a> [JURIST report] for speech or writing created outside the school environment. The Supreme Court has addressed freedom of speech in schools most recently in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2006/morvfre">Morse v. Frederick</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>].

A high school student was suspended after he displayed a banner with the message "Bong hits 4 Jesus" during a televised parade on a school day.

The suit <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/28/us-apple-ipcom-idUSBREA1R0T720140228">alleged</a> [Reuters report] USD $2.1 billion in damages against  Apple for infringement of European patent <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument;jsessionid=C51F6CB00DB2334D2E14A18C7D6C31FE.espacenet_levelx_prod_0?FT=D&date=20100317&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP&CC=EP&NR=1841268B1&KC=B1&ND=4">EP1841268</a> [text, in German], which manages access to overloaded wireless communication channels.

The <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verPrincipal.php?idioma=en_us">Brazil Supreme Court</a> [official website] overturned racketeering convictions of several former leaders of the <a href="http://www.pt.org.br/">Workers Party</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on Thursday by a 6-5 vote, which will result in lessened prison sentences. The convictions of corruption and money-laundering in the nation's largest political corruption case will not be affected by the decision. The court found that the racketeering charges lacked enough proof. Jose Dirceu, former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5346744.stm">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's</a> [BBC profile] chief of staff, received a sentence of two years of house arrest instead of his former sentence of 7 years and 11 months in prison. Jose Genoino, a former Workers Party president, and Delubio Soares, a former Workers Party treasurer, received lessened sentences as well. <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/senadores/dinamico/paginst/senador846a.asp">Senator Aloysio Nunes</a> [official website, in Portuguese], a leader of the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), said that the reduced sentences will not diminish the historical significance of the trial. 

<p>In September the Brazil Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/brazil-top-court-grants-new-trial-in-corruption-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that 12 of 25 defendants found guilty in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24967116">Mensalao scandal</a> [BBC backgrounder] had the right to a new trial. The court's decision outraged many who viewed the earlier convictions as an end to an impunity and wanted the case to end quickly. In 2012 Dirceu was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/brazil-high-court-sentences-ex-presidential-aid-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of using public funds to pay coalition parties for political support. The 2012 trials of those involved in the scandal were thought to be a turning point in the country's fight against corruption. In 2011 Brazilian Judge Patricia Acioli, known for taking a hard line against corrupt officials and militia death squads, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-judge-who-jailed-corrupt-officials-killed.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] outside of her home by two masked men on motorbikes. Acioli was one of three judges executed in Brazil in the past eight years for their investigations into organized crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sepulveda called on Guinea-Bissau to "move the country's politics away from short-term power struggles," and address "the consistent decline of investment in critical social services such as health and education, dramatically impairing the chances of further development." The statement made particular mention of the problems facing women and children in the impoverished West African nation, who face less access to health services, lower income, and higher incidence of HIV/AIDS.

<p>Guinea-Bissau has faced continuing political instability since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974.

The state <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/209603995/3-13-cv-00750-52">requested</a> [text] a stay of 90-days, but Judge John Heyburn II granted only 21 days for the state to implement the new rule. According to Heyburn's prior ruling, Kentucky's <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/233a.htm">constitutional amendment</a> [text] defining marriage as between "one man and one woman" is a violation of <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/intro.htm">Kentucky law</a> [text] and the Equal Protection Clause under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution since the language treats same-sex couples "differently in a way that demeans them." In granting the stay, Heybrun reasoned:<blockquote>The public interest is twofold: that the Constitution be upheld; and that changes in the law be implemented consistently without undue confusion. Confusion could result from state or local officials being unaware of their precise responsibilities. However, the implementation of the order without confusion is possible with reasonable effort. The Court concludes that a limited stay allows the state proper time to administratively prepare for compliance with the Order.</blockquote>Based on this ruling, Kentucky will now be required to recognize same-sex marriages starting on March 20, 2014. Heyburn noted in particular that the ruling does not involve the issuance of marriage licenses, so the requested extended stay would not be necessary.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. The original ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-orders-kentucky-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday. Earlier this week a judge for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a similar Texas constitutional amendment violates the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process. Also this week Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-appeals-ruling-against-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal ruling against the state's same-sex marriage ban. Last week Oregon's Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] her intention not to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court. Since July attorneys general in <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nevada-drops-defense-of-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Nevada</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/virginia-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/pennsylvania-ag-will-not-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Pennsylvania</a> [JURIST reports] have made similar decisions not to defend bans on same-sex marriage. Also last week, a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-allows-same-sex-marriage-licenses-in-cook-county-illinois.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same sex couples in Cook County could be issued marriage licenses immediately, rather than wait until June, when the state's same-sex marriage law goes into effect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The CHP claims the law is an attempt by the controlling party to avoid the consequences of the recent graft inquiry. Amid protests over suspected government corruption and violence inside parliament, the ruling <a href="http://www.siyasetakademisi.org/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] pushed the bill though parliament, thereby granting the Justice Ministry greater control over the <a href="http://www.hsyk.gov.tr/">Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors</a> (HSYK) [official website]. The controversy has sparked protests, to which police have responded with force. Since the graft scandal broke, the Turkish government has transferred or dismissed thousands of police officers and hundreds of judges and prosecutors. The law, which was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-pass-bill-increasing-control-over-judiciary.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, has already been used to appoint at least nine senior judges. In addition to appointing judges, the law would allow the Justice Ministry to fire or reassign thousands of administrative staff including secretaries-general, inspectors, audit judges and administrative staff

<p>In February the Turkish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-lawmakers-tighten-internet-restrictions.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation to heighten Internet restrictions, granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without the court's approval. In December Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-pm-replaces-cabinet-members.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 10 new members of his cabinet following the resignation of three members under investigation for graft. The controversy has highlighted some of the issues surrounding Turkey's judicial system. Also in December a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/turkish-court-rejects-release-of-detained-kurdish-lawmakers.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] bids to release two members of the parliament for the <a href="http://www.pkkonline.com/en/">Kurdish Peace and Democratic Party</a> (BDP), Gulser Yildirim and Ibrahim Ayhan. Yildirim and Ayhan have been detained since 2010 when they were each charged with links to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) [party website]. This decision came after Turkey's top court <a href="http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/152694/lengthy-detentions-39-unconstitutional-39-turkey-39-s-top-court-rules.html">ruled</a> [Turkish Weekly report] that the long-term detention of another member of parliament of the opposing party pending trial was in contradiction to the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The landmark ruling makes the first time in Pakistan's history that individuals have been tried and sentenced for the murder of a journalist. The two men receiving the death sentence were charged  <em>in absentia</em>, and the remaining four were sentenced to life in prison. The defendants are associated with the <a href="http://www.mqm.org/default.aspx">Muttahida Quami Movement</a> (MQM) [official website, in Urdu], a linguistic party that claims to support to 'realism and practicalism,' but the MQM denies any involvement. One of the men convicted in the case posted a confession to YouTube, claiming he was asked to follow Babar home from work by an activist from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). According to <a href="http://pfuj.pk">Pakistan's Federal Union of Journalists</a> (PFUJ) [official website], approximately 90 journalists have been killed in the last decade in different parts of Pakistan.

<p>Protection of free expression remains a key concern for international human rights advocates and nations around the world. In January two former Serbian senior secret service members were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/serbia-ex-secret-service-officials-arrested-for-1999-killing-of-activist.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] under suspicion that they planned the 1999 killing of anti-government journalist Slavko Curuvija. The <a href="http://www.cpj.org">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-deadliest-nations-for-journalists.php">published</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.cpj.org/reports/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-most-deadly-nations-for-journalis.php">report</a> [text] in December, finding Syria the most dangerous nation in the world for journalists, with Egypt and Iraq just behind. The CPJ's report found that of the estimated 70 journalists <a href="http://www.cpj.org/killed/2013/">killed worldwide</a> [CPJ database] in 2013, 29 were in Syria. Last September, two independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-experts-warn-uk-on-press-intimidation.php">stressed</a> [JURIST report] the UK's obligation to ensure that investigative journalists are allowed protection from intimidation and punishment. In August, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-philippines-must-take-action-over-journalist-killings.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Philippine government to act in order to bring the killers of three local journalists to justice and stop further violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Baldo completed a 10-day visit to Mali earlier this month and reported the justice system faces difficulties in prosecuting alleged perpetrators of serious crimes committed by armed groups during the occupation of the northern part of the country in 2012. Baldo encouraged the government to establish a special investigation unit to expedite investigations because many crimes remained unpunished. He stated: "It is up to the Government to develop a vision to cope with the failure of Malian justice and mobilize technical partners for logistics, security and financial support," and he explained it is critical that judges and police officers be deployed in places where the crimes were committed. Baldo also called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma/background.shtml">UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali</a> (MINUSMA) [UN backgrounder] and the international community to assist the government in supporting judges and their teams so that they can effectively conduct investigations on the ground, including materials, logistics, protection, and substantial resources necessary to visit the sites and locations where products are possible violations.

<p>Following the armed rising against the Malian government in early 2012, the nation has been the subject of international concern regarding war crimes committed by the Malian government and opposing forces. Last week, JURIST Guest Columnist Eric Leonard, the Henkel Family Chair in International Affairs at Shenandoah University, <a href="/hotline/2014/02/eric-leonard-us-icc.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that US President Barack Obama's recent memorandum regarding US troops in Mali represents a step backwards in the relationship between the US and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. In November General Amadou Haya Sanogo, the leader of the March 2012 coup, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/former-mali-junta-detained-for-murder.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of murder, complicity to murder, assassination and kidnapping. Last March, Malian Tuareg rebels <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mali-rebels-call-for-icc-investigation.php">called on the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged war crimes committed by Malian government forces during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier that day, Russian lawmakers <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-russia-ukraine-crimea-20140302,0,62155.story#axzz2upPi6HNC">unanimously authorized</a> [LAT report] the use of armed forces to protect their national interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine, after Russian troops had already taken positions in Crimea, a region of Ukraine that houses Russia's Black Sea fleet. While recognizing the need to protect minority Russian populations within the country, Obama called on Russia to "de-escalate tensions" by withdrawing forces and refraining from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine. "If Russia has concerns about the treatment of ethnic Russian and minority populations in Ukraine, the appropriate way to address them is peacefully through direct engagement with the government of Ukraine," Obama said to Putin, and stated that the US is prepared to facilitate a dialogue between Russia and the Ukrainian government. Obama also made clear that Russia's continued violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity will negatively impact Russia's standing in the international community. In light of Russia's continued violation of international law, the US will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8 summit, which will take place this summer in Sochi.

<p>Members of the EU have also condemned Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Finland's Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen on Saturday called the situation in Ukraine "very grave" and <a href="http://on.wsj.com/MDUv7l">urged</a> [WSJ report] "all parties, including Russia, to try to calm things down." The UK <a href="http://on.wsj.com/ME8Pwq">announced</a> [WSJ report] that they are "deeply concerned" at Russian's parliament's authorization of military action on Ukrainian soil," and summoned the Russian ambassador in the UK to register their deep concerns. The Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk on Saturday afternoon said "Europe and the world will not tolerate any aggression." and <a href="http://on.wsj.com/MEde2y">called to</a> [WSJ report] "pressure Russia for peace because it is this player who seems to be most interested in destabilizing situation in the region." Russia has not confirmed it deployed thousands of troops to the Crimea region despite reports that armed forces wearing Russian military uniforms without insignia are patrolling key infrastructure sites. </p>]]></content:encoded>

UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] will present his assessment report on the possibility of transforming the African-led peacekeeping force in the CAR into a UN peacekeeping mission before March 5. "It is urgent that the Security Council authorizes this UN peacekeeping operation," said AI Africa Director of Research and Advocacy Netsanet Belay. "They must be given a robust mandate to protect civilians." After successive missions to CAR, the AI has revealed that the African led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA) is under-resourced and ill equipped. Further, MISCA's poor coordination with French troops has failed to end the killings of civilians and the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim community in the country. "We witnessed peacekeeping soldiers being deployed to areas where they had no idea of what was going on, or even where they were. Their morale was low, their equipment poor, and many complained that they have not been paid for months." said Belay. "The Security Council must take decisive action. This is a matter of the greatest urgency&#8212;every day counts. Hundreds of thousands of people are suffering. Saving peoples lives must prevail over politics." 

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital last March. Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="jurist.org/paperchase/2014/02/un-car-leaders-personally-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">prompted</a> [JURIST report] CAR leaders to remember their legal obligations and stressed that they are personally accountable for human rights violations. In February AI <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ethnic-cleansing-occurring-in-central-african-republic-ai.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to take immediate and effective action to halt the spread of sectarian violence and "ethnic cleansing" within the western part of the CAR. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also in January the UN reported that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in the CAR. Earlier in January the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR. In December the <a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/unicef-report-brutal-killings-occurring-in-the-central-african-republic.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing horrific attacks against children in CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Convention was breached, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/icj-croatia-accuses-serbia-genocide-22748584">Croatia argues</a> [AP report], when forces from the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia tried to drive Croats out of parts of the country after Zagreb's 1991 declaration of independence. Serbs <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26415503">occupied the city of Vukovar</a> [BBC report] during a 1991-95 war that left the city devastated, and several hundred Vukovar citizens were murdered by the Yugoslav army and Serb maramilitaries in 1991. Croatia would also like the court to order Serbia to pay compensation. In response to the charges, Serbian representative Sasa Obradovic called the crimes that were committed in the 1990s "horrific," but said that they did not constitute genocide. Serbia has filed a counter claim over the 1995 expulsion of 230,000 Serbs from Croatia. 

<p>Investigations of war crimes related to the Bosnian-Serbian conflict are still ongoing and suspects are still being arrested and prosecuted. In January the appeals chamber for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/convicted-serbian-war-criminals-receive-reduced-sentences.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the criminal convictions of four Serbian senior officials stemming from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnia+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last September the ICTY allowed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Momcilo+Krajisnik">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [JURIST news archive], the former speaker for the Bosnian Serb parliament, to return to Bosnia after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-head-of-bosnian-serb-parliament-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report]. In August Danish judge Frederik Harhoff was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/danish-judge-removed-from-war-crimes-tribunal-for-bias.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] from the ICTY over claims of bias in a letter he wrote criticizing the court. The ICTY was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_827_1993_en.pdf">created</a> [text, PDF] in 1993 by UN Resolution 827 to adjudicate the alleged war crimes perpetrated in the region of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The ICTY's term of prosecution has been extended until December 2014. Since its inception, the ICTY has convicted numerous war criminals for atrocities committed in the widespread violence of the Balkan region. The tribunal has been working through an immense caseload for the past 20 years and has recently delegated much of the war crime adjudication to the courts of individual Balkan nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/integrity-staffing-solutions-inc-v-busk/">Integrity Staffing Solutions v. Busk</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will address whether time spent passing through post-work security screenings is compensable in the form of overtime pay pursuant to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-8">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> [text]. On appeal from the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], the plaintiffs are warehouse workers at various sorting facilities connected to online retailer <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> [corporate website] who were required to pass through security screening procedures after work without pay.

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/omnicare-inc-v-laborers-district-council-construction-industry-pension-fund/">Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will address a circuit split with respect to whether plaintiffs can plead that a statement of opinion is "untrue" for purposes of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_act_of_1933">Security Act of 1933</a> [text] by alleging that the opinion itself is objectively wrong, or whether plaintiffs must also allege that the statement was subjectively false, which requires allegations that the speaker's actual opinion was different from the one expressed. Petitioner <a href="http://www.omnicare.com">Omnicare</a> [corporate website] is a publicly traded corporation that is the US' largest provider of pharmaceutical care services for the elderly. Respondents are a class of investors who allege Omnicare issued them stock under a registration statement with "an untrue statement of a material fact."</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/warger-v-shauers/">Warger v. Shauers</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will address whether <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_606">Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b)</a> [text] permits a party, seeking a new trial on the basis of juror dishonesty during <em>voir dire</em>, to introduce juror testimony with respect to statements made during deliberations that tend to show the alleged dishonesty. During <em>voir dire</em> in a personal injury suit, a potential juror pledged to remain impartial but later revealed her bias toward the defendant during jury deliberations. Another juror submitted an affidavit detailing the juror's statements, and the plaintiff sought a new trial. The <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit</a> [official website] affirmed the district court's order, denying the plaintiff a new trial. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/north-carolina-board-of-dental-examiners-v-federal-trade-commission/">North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will examine whether, for purposes of the state-action exemption from federal antitrust law, an official state regulatory board created by state law may properly be treated as a "private" actor because, pursuant to state law, a majority of the board's members are also market participants who are elected to their official positions by other market participants. This case stems from a <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decision, in which the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] filed an administrative complaint alleging anticompetitive activities against a North Carolina board of dentistry after it ordered unlicensed practitioners to cease and desist from providing teeth-whitening services in the state. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/holt-v-hobbs/">Holt v. Hobbs</a>[SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court will address whether the <a href="http://adc.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Arkansas Department of Corrections</a> [official website] "no beard growing" policy violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21C">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [text] or the First Amendment, and whether a half-inch beard would satisfy the security goals sought by this policy. The petitioner is a Muslim male detained in the state's prison who sought to enjoin the state from requiring that he shave his beard on grounds that he is exempt from the policy because of his religion. In a handwritten <em>pro se</em> petition for <em>certiorari</em>, the petitioner sought the court's review after the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the district court did not err when it refused to recognize the petitioner's argument for a religious exception exemption from the state's policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The incident began around 9:00 AM local time, a time when crowds gather in the area, when gunmen entered the court complex and opened fire before the detonation of two suicide blasts. The attack comes shortly after the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) promised a month-long ceasefire and the government pledged to suspend air strikes against militants. A TTP spokesperson has announced that TTP <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26412921">was not involved</a> [BBC report]. Ahrar-ul-Hind, a small group that told AFP it had no links with TTP has claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that they operate independently from TTP and do not favor the ceasefire or peace talks. A spokesperson for the group stated that their main issue with the talks was the lack of mention of the implementation of Sharia law.

<p>Suicide attacks targeting major public areas have been far from uncommon in recent years. Last month the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-rose-by-14-percent-in-2013.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] the 2013 Annual Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict which found a total of 8,615 civilian casualties in 2013, a 14 percent increase since 2012. In 2010 a suicide bomber <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iraq-interior-ministry-targeted-in-car.php">detonated</a> [JURIST report]a car bomb outside of the Forensics Lab of the Iraqi Ministry of Interior's Criminal Investigation Department, killing 21 people and injuring at least 80 others. Earlier that year an Iraqi court sentenced 11 men to death for the August 19 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8208976.stm">bombing of the foreign and finance ministries</a> [BBC report] in Baghdad that left close to 100 dead. Also in 2010 Russia faced twin suicide bombing attacks on Moscow subway stations, prompting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/russia-president-calls-for-amended.php">propose amending</a> [JURIST report] the country's terrorism legislation. In 2009 Taliban insurgents targeting the Afghan Ministry of Justice, the Prisons Directorate and other government buildings in <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/afghan-justice-ministry-attacked-by.php">coordinated attacks</a> [JURIST report] on the capital city of Kabul, killing an estimated 28 people and injuring more than 60. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, <a href="http://repository.uchastings.edu/ca_ballot_props/1006/">Proposition 89</a> [text], entitled the "Governor's Parole Review," was passed in 1988 to allow the governor to reverse approved paroles in murder cases. In deeming both laws unconstitutional, the judge said that it was an abuse of power to require longer sentences than those in place when the prisoners actually committed the crimes.

<p>This is the most recent case in a changing environment of sentencing guidelines. Last month New York announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/new-york-agrees-to-reform-solitary-confinement-law.php">reform sentencing</a> [JURIST report] in a way that would reduce the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=solitary+confinement">solitary confinement</a> [JURIST news archive] and ban solitary confinement for prisoners under 18 years old. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-rules-on-mandatory-sentencing-for-drug-dealers.php">relaxed sentencing guidelines</a> [JURIST report] for drug dealers. In October three companies behind private juvenile detention and treatment facilities involved in a northeastern Pennsylvania <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sentencing+scandal">juvenile justice scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/pennsylvania-detention-facilities-settle-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a civil lawsuit for $2.5 million.

The <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Clinics/VVA_PTSD_3.3.14_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], which names the US <a href="http://www.army.mil/">Army</a>, <a href="http://www.navy.mil/">Navy</a> and <a href="http://www.af.mil/">Air Force</a>  [official websites] as defendants, argues that veterans who were given "undesirable" discharges for conduct attributable to undiagnosed PTSD should have had their discharge status subsequently upgraded. According to the complaint, such veterans are deprived of disability compensation they would otherwise be entitled to. The plaintiffs in the case are represented by the <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/academics/veteranslegalservicesclinic.htm">Veterans Legal Service Clinic at Yale Law School</a> [advocacy website]. 

<p>The issue of upgrade petitions for Vietnam veterans with PTSD has been ongoing, and, since 1993, only <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/vietnam-veterans-sue-military-ptsd-22753292">4.5 percent</a> [AP report] of PTSD discharge upgrades have been granted for Vietnam veterans. In 2012 students of the Yale Veterans Clinic filed another class action lawsuit in federal court dealing with discharge upgrades for PTSD. However, the lead plaintiff ultimately signed a <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140303/new-haven-vietnam-veteran-with-ptsd-others-file-class-action-lawsuit">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the Army granting him the discharge upgrade before a class was certified, prompting the current class action suit. US <a href="http://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/">Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut</a> [official website] held a press conference at Yale Law School where he <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140303/new-haven-vietnam-veteran-with-ptsd-others-file-class-action-lawsuit">indicated his support</a> [New Haven Register report] for the plaintiffs and stated that the "veterans are long overdue present day appreciation of modern mental health in the timely review of their discharge upgrade appeals." </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-10882_7758.pdf">Hall v. Florida</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/supreme-court-adds-two-new-cases-to-docket.php">report</a>] the court will decide "whether the Florida scheme for identifying mentally retarded defendants in capital cases violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/00-8452P.ZO">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [text, PDF]," a case in which the Supreme Court found it unconstitutional to execute mentally retarded individuals. Florida currently employs a cut-off scheme in which anyone who tests below a certain number on an IQ test is found to be mentally retarded and thus exempt from execution. Petitioner, Freddie Lee Hall, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1978, and his IQ test score was above Florida's cutoff. The judgment against Hall was later <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Hall_v_State_109_So_3d_704_Fla_2012_Court_Opinion">affirmed</a> [opinion] by the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/index.html">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>The institution of the death penalty in the US has been under scrutiny recently. Last month Washington Governor <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Jay Inslee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/washington-governor-announces-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">announced a moratorium on executions</a> [JURIST report] in the state. Earlier in February Florida's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/florida-high-court-orders-a-review-of-new-lethal-injection-drug.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an evidentiary hearing to determine if the sedative midazolam should remain in the state's lethal injection procedure. Also in February a judge for the <a href="http://www.lamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website] declared that the scheduled execution of 70-year-old Christopher Sepulvado by lethal injection <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">would be delayed</a> [JURIST report] for 90 days to permit time to expand the state's execution protocol to include a new two-drug mixture. The review of lethal injection procedures in a number of states stems from the prolonged <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of convicted murderer Dennis McGuire in January. In December, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-794_j42l.pdf">White v. Woodall</a> [transcript, PDF]  <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-hears-international-child-abduction-death-penalty-cases.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on jury instructions in a death penalty case in which the defendant chose not to testify and requested, and was denied, that the jury be instructed to not draw adverse inferences from his decision not to testify. JURIST Guest Columnist Laura Kagel explores the case of Warren Lee Hill, Jr. and the <a href="/forum/2012/08/laura-kagel-hill-execution.php">tensions between mental disability and execution</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the state of Georgia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Lewis Kaplan of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] instructed Abu Ghaith to face prospective jurors, in order to determine whether any of the prospective jurors recognized him or had previously heard of him. Abu Ghaith, who is the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/osama-bin-laden-son-in-law-goes-on-trial-in-nyc/">highest profile al Qaeda figure</a> [AP report] to face trial on US soil, is <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Indictment-S13-98-Cr-1023-Stamped.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] of conspiring to kill Americans and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and faces a potential life sentence.

The court's denial will will let stand lower court rulings that the ordinances are unconstitutional and prohibited from taking effect in their proposed locations of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/city-of-hazleton-v-lozano/">Hazleton, Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-516.htm">Farmers Branch, Texas</a> [case dockets].

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years when many states passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Last month Washington state legislators <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/washington-state-lawmakers-pass-financial-aid-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to make college students who were brought to the US illegally by their parents eligible for need-based college financial aid. In December New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/nj-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will allow undocumented students to be eligible for in-state tuition rates to attend state colleges. In April Oregon's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/oregon-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing undocumented immigrants to attend public universities at the same tuition rate as in-state residents.

In her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14301&LangID=E">opening remarks</a> [press release], the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged states to take a proactive approach to the protection of human rights, especially in light of recent protests, stating:<blockquote>Streets, airwaves, entire countries are buzzing with demands for economic, social and political justice. More and more, people are confidently laying claim to their rights. This Council has given space to them and the civil society that represents them in its deliberations, panels, and side events. Vigilance however is important. While we must continue to ensure civil society engagement at the international level, this is no guarantor that it will be complemented at the national level. We need to work together to ensure that the space, voice and knowledge of civil society is nurtured in all our countries.</blockquote>At the conclusion of Pillay's statement, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] also gave remarks, highlighting the recently launched <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/rightsupfront/">Rights Up Front Initiative</a> [official website], an action plan designed to ensure that human rights considerations are the <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/rightsupfront/doc/dsg-press-conference.html?statID=2068">highest priority in UN activities</a> [press release], seeking to respond to human rights violations before they become "mass atrocities". 

<p>The UNHRC has previously reported on widespread human rights violations occurring in <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/children-suffer-trauma-from-syrian-war-un-rights-experts.php">Syria</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-iran-abuses.php">Iran</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-expert-urges-myanmar-to-protect-human-rights.php">Myanmar</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-commission-finds-serious-violations-in-north-korea.php">North Korea</a> [JURIST reports]. In February, UN human rights investigators <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-north-korea-rights-violations-may-constitute-crimes-against-humanity.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] on abuses in North Korea to the UNHRC for debate in its March session. The 372-page report detailed widespread crimes against humanity that the investigators believe should be brought to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Also in February, Pillay asked the UNHRC to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe.php">set up an independent probe</a> to ensure accountability for the war crimes committed during the 26-year <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations-and-networks/sri-lankan-conflict/p11407">Sri Lankan Civil War</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">news archive</a>] that ended in 2009. In November, the president of the UNHRC, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/Presidency.aspx">Remigiusz Henczel</a> [official website], presented an annual report, claiming the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-human-rights-council-presents-annual-report.php">achieved significant progress</a> [JURIST report], adopting "107 resolutions, decisions and President's statements" within the last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In what is being called a victory for immigrants' rights, the state will no longer defend the provision that allowed police officers to demand proof of citizenship or legal residency during routine traffic stops and to detain individuals to determine their immigration status. The law is based on the model provided by Arizona's divisive 2011 immigration law, <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">SB 1070</a> [materials].

BP had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/business/energy-environment/court-says-bps-spill-agreement-is-binding.html?_r=0">argued</a> [NYT report] that the settlement agreement allowed many business to collect payments without having to prove that the damage was caused either by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill or by BP's conduct, saying that the agreement forces BP to pay for damages it did not cause. However, Judge Leslie Southwick, writing for the majority, dismissed that claim, stating that the terms of the agreement do not require claimants to submit evidence establishing a causal relationship. The ruling further <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/04/us-bp-idUSBREA230IR20140304">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the terms of the agreement were not subject to alteration by BP, that they were the result of agreements between the parties and were approved by the district court, and that BP would have to abide by them. The dissenting judge <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-04/bp-must-live-with-oil-spill-settlement-terms-court-rules-1-.html">claimed</a> [Bloomberg report] that enforcing the settlement agreement in this manner improperly allowed parties to collect damages for unrelated claims, and raised significant constitutional issues with respect to the parties' standing. 

<p>BP's legal troubles relating to the Deepwater Horizon spill have been <a href="/sidebar/2014/02/brent-coon-bp-settlement.php">continuous</a> [JURIST op-ed] and expensive, as BP has already paid billions of dollars to settle both civil and criminal claims. In January the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-multibillion-dollar-settlement-for-bp-oil-spill.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a previous argument made by BP, that the settlement should be invalidated because the possible inclusion of individuals not injured by BP's conduct rendered class certification improper. The US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-rules-proof-of-direct-causation-unnecessary-for-bp-oil-spill-claimants.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in December that proof of direct causation was not necessary for the settlement agreement and did not require its invalidation. However the Fifth Circuit in October did <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-rejects-judges-interpretation-of-bp-oil-spill-settlement.php">reverse</a> [JURIST report] and remand a previous district court decision that it said allowed recovery for "artificial and inflated claims."</p>]]></content:encoded>

FMR LLC</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the whistleblower provision <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1514A">18 USC &#167; 1514A</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/soa2002.pdf">Sarbones Oxley Act of 2002</a> (SOX) [text, PDF] protects employees of private contractors and subcontractors performing work for a public company, just as it shelters employees of the public company. The opinion references the "mischief" that Congress was responding to with the passage of SOX in 2002, including the retaliatory practices against employees that questioned fraudulent practices within Enron and Arthur Anderson. With this backdrop, the court upheld whistleblower protection for private contractors of a public employee, citing the numerous provisions in SOX aimed at controlling the conduct of accountants, auditors, and lawyers who work with public companies. The court stated: "Given Congress' concern about contractor conduct of the kind that contributed to Enron's collapse, we regard with suspicion construction of &#167; 1514A to protect whistleblowers only when they are employed by a public company, and not when they work for the public company's contractor."           

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-adds-5-cases-to-next-years-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case in May after the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13679670161776916145&q=LAWSON+v.+FMR+LLC,+670+F.3d+61+&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that privately-employed contractors and subcontractors, may retaliate against their own employees, but are prohibited from retaliating against employees of the public companies with which they work. The Supreme Court's opinion on Tuesday reversed and remanded the ruling from the First Circuit. The lawsuit originated when plaintiffs Jackie Lawson and Jonathan Zang initiated proceedings against their former employers, privately held companies offering advisory and management services to the Fidelity family of mutual funds, under the larger FMR LLC corporate structure. The Fidelity funds themselves have no employees. Lawson was employed by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, a subsidiary of FMR LLC, and Zang was employed by a different FMR LLC subsidiary. Lawson was employed by FMR for 14 years. After she raised concerns about Fidelity cost-accounting methods she was subjected to a series of adverse actions, ultimately resulting in her constructive discharge. Zang was employed by FMR for eight years and he claimed a retaliatory discharge after he raised concerns about inaccuracies in a draft of SEC registration statement concerning Fidelity funds.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26432122">ruling</a> [BBC report] was based on connections between Hamas, the Islamist ruling party of Palestine, with the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>], a similar Egyptian organization from which it split in the 1980s that was <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">also branded a terrorist organization</a> [JURIST report] and banned in September.

Hamas has condemned the ruling, claiming that it is a "political decision" that "reflects a form of standing against Palestinian resistance."

<p>The Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-convicts-alleged-terrorist-group.php">convicted 26 people</a> [JURIST report] in February of forming a terrorist group with the intent to attack the <a href="http://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/">Suez Canal</a> [official website].

Siegel</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a bankruptcy court improperly exceeded its authority by ordering legally exempt funds to be used to pay attorney's costs. The case revolved around a Chapter 7 bankruptcy claim filed by California resident Stephen Law, in which his home was valued at over $300,000, with $75,000 of that amount being legally exempt from bankruptcy proceedings under California law. Alfred Siegel was appointed trustee of the bankruptcy claim. He later discovered that Law had fraudulently represented certain liens on the property in order to protect the $75000, and claimed the money as compensation for the added costs of discovering the fraud. The bankruptcy court agreed, and its decision was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court reversed, saying that the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority by using it to "sanction abusive litigation practices." The court <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/national/248376551.html">held</a> [AP report] that the bankruptcy court had no authority to override a state law exemption to penalize a dishonest party.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-presidential-recess-appointments.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January. Law argued that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522">&#167; 522</a> [text] of the Bankruptcy Code shows a congressional intent to exempt certain assets from bankruptcy collection, regardless of whether the debtor has acted in bad faith. Siegel contended that bankruptcy courts may revoke such exemptions to prevent abuses of the judicial process. The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-to-rule-in-housing-discrimination-case.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case last June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Georgia House approved the bill on Monday by an overwhelming majority of 171-4. <a href="http://www.house.ga.gov/representatives/en-US/Member.aspx?Member=185&Session=23">Rep. Allen Peake</a> (R) [official website] of Macon, Georgia, sponsored the bill, and his support for the issue was <a href="http://www.macon.com/2014/03/03/2969881/medical-marijuana-bill-passes.html">inspired</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] in part by a constituent's four-year-old daughter that suffers from an extreme seizure disorder. The bill contains several provisions directed to study the benefits of medical cannabis to treat conditions related to seizures, as well as cancer and glaucoma. Further, it will allow Georgia's five medical research universities to cultivate cannabis in order to extract cannabidiol (CBD), a non hallucinogenic cannabidoiol, from the plant. The bill will now travel to the Georgia state Senate, where Peake believes the bill may be tightened before it becomes law because it includes many groundbreaking provisions.

The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], asserted that Sprint knowingly submitted false "reimbursement of expenses" claims from January 1, 2007 to July 31, 2010, amounting to $21 million in overcharged expenses. The complaint alleged that by including these expenses, Sprint violated a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] order requiring broadband and Internet phone companies to cover the costs of providing mandatory wiretap access to law enforcement authorities as required by the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/communications-assistance-law-enforcement-act">Communications Assistance in Law Enforcement Act</a> (CALEA) [text]. The complaint stated that Sprint's invoices did not specifically identify its invoiced expenses, and that "federal law enforcement agencies were unable to detect that Sprint was requesting reimbursement of these unallowable costs." A spokesperson for Sprint <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/03/us-usa-sprint-complaint-idUSBREA2229B20140303">indicated </a>[Reuters report] Monday that the company was in full compliance with the law that they would defend the matter in court. 

<p>A similar lawsuit was filed against Sprint in 2009, but the case was <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1030096/att.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF; Law 360 <a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/486605/at-t-sprint-dodge-fca-suit-over-wiretap-services">report</a>] last November by a federal district court citing lack of subject matter jurisdiction and issues of standing. In June 2006 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-fcc.php">upheld CALEA</a> [JURIST report], which requires telecommunications companies to allow law enforcement officials access to their networks for wiretapping and other purposes. In May of that year, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/fcc-requires-broadband-internet-phone.php">voted to require</a> [JURIST report] broadband and Internet phone companies to cover the costs of providing wiretap services, settling the year-long dispute. The FCC made wiretap access mandatory in an order in September 2005. A coalition of privacy and technology groups <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/federal-internet-wiretapping-rule.php">challenged the requirement</a> [JURIST report] later that year, citing privacy concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rickard</a> [transcript, PDF] on whether the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in denying qualified immunity to police offers who were found to have used unreasonable force against a suspect. The case was brought on appeal by six officers who claimed qualified legal immunity to a civil lawsuit filed by the daughter of a man killed when he lost control of his vehicle after being shot by police officers following a high-speed pursuit along the border of Arkansas and Tennessee. Counsel for petitioners argued that they "were not given fair warning that the use of force in this case, if it was prohibited, was prohibited, and they retain immunity, and the Sixth Circuit must be reversed." Counsel for respondent argued that there are material issues of fact that remain in dispute, and that those issues should be determined by a jury. Counsel for the US also argued on the petitioner's behalf.

<p><span class="casename">Plumhoff v. Rickard</span> is closely related to the US Supreme Court's 2007 decision in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Scott_v_Harris_550_US_372_127_S_Ct_1769_167_L_Ed_2d_686_2007_Cour">Scott v. Harris</a> [text]. In this case, the court held that police did not use excessive force in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] when they rammed a car during a high-speed pursuit in order to stop a suspect who, as a result of the incident, was rendered quadriplegic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in his near 500-page ruling that the punishment inflicted against Chevron did not justify the means, and that the Ecuadorian court's judgement "was obtained by corrupt means." Kaplan reported that fraudulent evidence had been introduced in the case, and that lawyers arranged to write the opinion against Chevron themselves by coercing a judge. Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president, <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/03042014_uscourtdeclaresecuadorjudgmentagainstchevroncorporationfraudulentunenforceable.news">stated</a> [press release] regarding the judgment, "We are confident that any court that respects the rule of law will likewise find the Ecuadorian judgment to be illegitimate and unenforceable." Lawyers for Ecuadoreans reported that they will be filing an appeal, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ny-judge-rules-chevron-ecuador-case-22765862">saying</a> [AP report] the decision "constitutes a mockery of the rule of law and will not serve to reduce the risk the oil company faces in the imminent collection of the sentence dictated against it by the Ecuadorean justice system."</p>

<p>This is the newest result in one of the pending cases against Chevron. An Ecuadorian court in November <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ecuador-high-court-halves-judgment-against-chevron.php">ordered Chevron</a> [JURIST report] to pay USD $9.51 billion in fines and legal fees, which significantly reduced the court's earlier judgement. In June of 2012 Ecuador <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-ecuadorian-plaintiffs-in-the.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Chevron in Canada. Earlier, in February, the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/02/ecuador-court-rejects-injunction-on-chevron-fine.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an arbitration decision by The PCA which had the effect of temporarily enjoining the $18.2 billion judgment that was upheld in January after an <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/chevron-appeals-ecuador-courts-18-billion-fine.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] until a final judgment was made by the PCA. A month earlier, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/second-circuit-allows-ecuador-courts-18-billion-judgment-against-chevron.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] the injunction against enforcement of the multi-billion judgment granted to Chevron by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, reasoning that judgment-debtors like Chevron can challenge a foreign judgment's validity under the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act only defensively and in response to an attempted enforcement which was not initiated by the plaintiffs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge John Heyburn of the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-orders-kentucky-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in February that Kentucky's <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/233a.htm">constitutional amendment</a> [text] defining marriage as between "one man and one woman" is a violation of <a href="http://www.lrc.ky.gov/legresou/constitu/intro.htm">Kentucky law</a> [text] and the Equal Protection Clause under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution. In his statement Beshear voiced the view that controversy over same-sex marriage "will be and should be ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court." The governor also advocated for a stay of the ruling during the appeal process stating that without it the "opportunity for legal chaos is real." Heyburn on March 1 <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-stays-enforcement-of-kentucky-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] 21 days for the state to implement the new rule after the state requested a stay of 90 days. Beshear's decision to seek outside counsel in the case comes after <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Attorney General Jack Conway</a> [official website] informed the governor that he would <a href="http://nation.time.com/2014/03/04/kentuckys-attorney-general-explains-why-he-wont-defend-gay-marriage-ban/">not continue defending</a> [TIME report] the state's ban on gay marriage.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Texas constitutional amendment similar to the one in Kentucky violates the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process. Also in February Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-appeals-ruling-against-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a federal ruling against the state's same-sex marriage ban. A week before Oregon's Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] her intention not to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage in court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] on Tuesday refused to block the state's ban on same-sex marriage pending outcome of a trial. Judge Barbara Crabb refused to grant the <a href="https://aclu-wi.org/">American Civil Liberties Union's</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] motion to enjoin enforcement of the ban on grounds that doing so would merely <a href="http://chippewa.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-proposes-speedy-trial-for-gay-marriage-lawsuit/article_8d1a328a-b1d6-51c6-87a6-101c7587967b.html">delay the case's final disposition</a> [<em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> report]. According to media sources, the judge reasoned that the entrance of an injunction would invariably lead to a challenge by the state, which would in turn force the court to stay the injunction's enforcement. The judge urged the parties to instead pursue a quick resolution of the case without the injunction. Article XIII, Section 13 of the <a href="http://docs.legis.wi.gov/constitution/wi/XIII/13">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [text] defines marriage as between one man and one woman and bars recognition of same-sex marriages that occur in other jurisdictions. Additionally, Wisconsin's <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/765/30">marriage evasion law</a> [text] makes it a criminal offense to leave the state and enter a marriage contract that is prohibited under Wisconsin law. The lawsuit was filed on behalf <a href="https://aclu-wi.org/story/meet-couples-our-marriage-lawsuit">four same-sex couples</a> [ACLU profiles] in order to have the state of Wisconsin permit marriage for same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages that occur in other jurisdictions. The ACLU argues that Wisconsin's marriage laws violate the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the US Constitution and run counter to the US Supreme Court holding in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report].  

<p><a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly polarizing issue in the American legal community. Numerous challenges to same-sex marriage bans have arisen before state and federal courts in recent months. In January a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/virginia-same-sex-marriage-suit-granted-class-action-status.php">certified a class action</a> [JURIST report] lawsuit challenging Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage.

Three other abortion bills were also passed by the House Tuesday. The first increases the waiting period before an abortion can be performed to 48 hours from the current 24 hours. The second, <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2014rs/PrintFiles/HB493-int.pdf">HB 493</a> [text, PDF], calls for a minimum 48-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed for woman who learns her fetus has a terminal condition that will result in death outside the womb. During that period the woman would be required to learn about prenatal hospice options, of which, according to <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppse/">Planned Parenthood Southeast</a> [advocacy website], there are none in Alabama. The third bill would place new restrictions on minors seeking abortion permission from a judge. Under the new bill parents of the minor would be allowed to participate in the proceedings. All four bills will go to the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Alabama State Senate</a> [official website].

The commission's official report, which is premised upon interviews and investigations occurring between July 2013 and January 2014, details widespread attacks on civilians via "siege warfare" within a climate of prevailing impunity. The commission reports that more than 250,000 Syrians are besieged in Syria, where they are subjected to "relentless shelling and bombardment" and denied basic necessities like food and medical care. The commission reports that the government has used "incendiary" and chemical weapons, especially sarin gas, against civilians and combatants on multiple occasions. According to the commission, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] "bears responsibility" for continually "allowing" the warring parties to violate international law with impunity. The report is slated to go before the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] on March 18.

<p>The Syrian Civil War has persisted for almost three years. The conflict has been highlighted by countless human rights violations and use of chemical weaponry, which has created mounting pressure among the international community to find an end to the conflict. In February, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-syria-un-rights-experts.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that both sides have been committing human rights violations. The day before, Syria <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/syria-signs-agreement-to-dispose-of-chemical-weapons.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to dispose of their chemical weapons. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to the Security Council, which highlights the severe suffering faced by children in Syria during the period between March 2011 and November 2013. The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have killed and tortured extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children, as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tuesday was the fifth anniversary of his <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] on five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, torture, rape, extermination, and forcible transfer). In the open letter addressed to the UN Security Council and the International Criminal Court, the groups expressed "grave concern" about al-Bashir's continued impunity, and accused the international community of failing to impose consequences for al-Bashir's atrocities and letting the Sudanese government continue its crimes in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur</a> [BBC backgrounder] and the rest of Sudan. Al-Bashir has continuously stated that he will not turn himself in to stand trial. He has traveled to many African countries during this time, all of whose governments have refused to arrest him. The open letter stated, "The failure to hold Bashir accountable not only has devastating effects inside Sudan, but it also sends the wrong message to leaders like Syrian President Assad and others perpetrating extreme violence throughout the world."

<p>In September Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/ai-un-members-should-demand-sudan-president-surrender-to-icc.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] members of the UN to demand al-Bashir turn himself in to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has continually faced difficulties in enforcing its arrest warrant against al-Bashir, in part because of the lack of support by neighbor states. In July the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/icc-urges-nigeria-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Nigeria to arrest al-Bashir while he was in their jurisdiction. In June 2012 former ICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said that economic or other aid <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/reject-aid-for-countries-that-refuse-to-arrest-al-bashir-icc.php">should be refused</a> [JURIST report] to those countries that assist al-Bashir in evading the arrest warrant that was issued against him in 2010. In July 2010 the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] al-Bashir with three counts of genocide. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Republican-backed <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/51leg/2r/bills/hb2284h.htm">measure</a> [HB 2284, text], which passed in the House 34-22, would delete a provision in a state law that mandates that an administrative warrant be obtained from a judge to inspect any of the nine licensed abortion clinics in Arizona. The state does not require a warrant to inspect other medical facilities. Supporters of the bill say that this is not a pro-life versus pro-choice issue, but about the healthiness of a facility where medical procedures are being performed. However, opponents of the measure, including Arizona state Representative <a href="http://otondofor4.com/">Lisa Otondo</a> [official website], believe the bill to be unconstitutional, and will be challenged in court if it becomes law. The measure must still be approved by the state Senate and signed by <a href="http://www.governor.state.az.us/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] before it can become law and join the 10 other states that currently allow for such surprise inspections. 

<p>There has been much controversy surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. Last month the South Dakota House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/south-dakota-house-passes-bill-prohibiting-gender-based-abortions.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit individuals from having abortions based on the gender of the fetus. In January the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Center for Reproductive Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/advocacy-groups-sue-to-protect-abortion-access-in-alaska.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Alaska Superior Court challenging a new regulation that seeks to prevent Medicaid from covering elective abortions. In November a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana issued a <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/jurist-the-us-district-court-1.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law regulating abortion facilities. Also in November Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/arizona-ag-asks-us-supreme-court-to-reinstate-abortion-law.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to reinstate an Arizona law and overturn the holding of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which in August <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that would strip Medicaid funding from doctors and clinics that perform abortions. In October a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-arizona-race-based-abortion-law.php">dismissed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Arizona's race based abortion laws. In May a federal court struck down the state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">20-week abortion ban</a> [JURIST report].

Republic of Argentina</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], an international arbitration case that raises the question of whether, in disputes involving a multi-staged dispute resolution process, a court or the arbitrator determines whether a precondition to arbitration has been satisfied. The case involves a Bilateral Investment Treaty between the UK and Argentina, signed into law in 1990. The treaty provides that a dispute between an investor and a host stat will be resolved in the host state's courts, and if no timely resolution is reached, then the case proceeds to arbitration. British investor BG Group invoked the arbitration clause against Argentina without first filing in Argentine court. The panel found that it had jurisdiction and awarded damages to BG Group. Argentina then filed a motion in federal court to vacate the award. Though the district court denied the Argentina's motion to vacate the award, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Republic_of_Argentina_v_BG_Group_PLC_665_F3d_1363_DC_Cir_2012_Cou">reversed</a> [opinion] in 2012 and vacated the award, prompting the appeal to the US Supreme Court. Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer reversed the DC Circuit holding that, while Argentina was entitled to court review of the arbitrator's decision, the actions of the arbitrator were lawful.

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that defendants have to know in advance that their accomplices would use or carry a gun while committing a crime in order to be convicted under federal gun laws. Justus Rosemond was charged, among other things, for using a gun in connection with a drug trafficking charge, or aiding and abetting that offense in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">18 USC &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1)(A) and 2</a> [text]. At trial, a federal jury convicted and sentenced Rosemond to 14 years. The Court took up Rosemond's case to determine whether the aiding and abetting charge requires proof of intentional facilitation or encouragement of the use of a firearm, or simple knowledge that the principal used a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in which the defendant also participated. In resolving the circuit split, the majority found that intent is critical: "the &#167; 924(c ) defendant's knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge&#8212;or otherwise said, knowledge that enables him to make the relevant legal (and indeed, moral choice)," Justice Elena Kagan wrote.<blockquote>When an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate's design to carry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan, or in unsuccessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows his intent to aid an <em>armed</em> offense. But when an accomplice knows nothing of a gun until it appears at the scene, he may already have completed his acts of assistance; or even if not, he may at that late point have no realistic opportunity to quit the crime. And when that is so, the defendant has not shown the requisite intent to assist a crime involving a gun.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, filed a partial dissent, accusing the the majority of confusing the concepts of intent and motive:<blockquote>[The Court] seems to assume that, if a defendant's <em>motive</em> in aiding a criminal venture is to avoid some greater evil, he does not have the <em>intent</em> that the venture succeed. But the intent to undertake some act is of course perfectly consistent with the motive of avoiding adverse consequences which would otherwise occur.</blockquote> By converting what has been an affirmative defense into a part of the required <em>mens rea</em>, Alito argued that the court "fundamentally alters the prior understanding of mental states that form the foundation of substantive criminal law, and places a strange and difficult burden on the prosecution." ]]></content:encoded>

Alvarez</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that under the Hague Convention, the one-year period for filing a petition for a child's abduction to another country is not subject to equitable tolling. The court stated that to invoke the remedy under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the parent seeking to have the child returned to the country must file a petition within one year of the abduction. In the court's opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas stated, "We do not apply equitable tolling as a matter of some independent authority to reconsider the fairness of legislative judgments balancing the needs for relief and repose." The court also opined that the Hague Convention continues to direct the court to order a child's return after a year has passed, "unless it is demonstrated that the child is settled in its new environment." Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, filed a concurring opinion. 

<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-hears-international-child-abduction-death-penalty-cases.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in December. While the US Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits all previously held the one-year period may be equitably tolled, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in this case that the one-year period is not subject to equitable tolling and the settled defense is still available even where, as here, the abducting parent conceals the location of the child.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Individuals reported to <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/mcclatchy-newspapers/">McClatchy Newspapers</a> [official website] that this request may be based on monitoring by the CIA of various Senate Intelligence Committee computers that were used while preparing the study. The in-depth study concerns the CIA's alleged use of <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/03/05/CIA-inspector-general-seeks-probe-of-agency-conduct-over-Senate-report/UPI-93101394035636/">harsh interrogation methods</a> [UPI report] on certain suspected terrorists who are held in secret overseas prisons. The study also allegedly speaks of various ways in which the CIA misled the George W. Bush administration regarding the interrogation methods. Various senators have received inquiries regarding the study, however, have not provided much more information than that there is currently an internal review occurring within the CIA.

<p>The CIA has received strong criticism regarding its overseas detention programs and techniques in recent years. Egyptian cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nasr">Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive], who was kidnapped in Milan as part of the CIA's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive], was sentenced to six years in prison in December by an Italian court after being convicted <em>in absentia</em> of terror charges.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-317_e18f.pdf">Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. Johnson Fund, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF] the court will decide whether the <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Erica_P_John_Fund_Inc_v_Halliburton_Co_718_F3d_423_5th_Cir_2013_C">Fifth Circuit's ruling</a> [text] is contradictory both to prior Supreme Court precedents and to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23</a> [text] by requiring plaintiffs in securities fraud cases to show loss causation to obtain class certification, or whether that causation should be brought at trial. The Supreme Court ruling will settle a circuit split between the Fifth Circuit and the <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/088033p.pdf">Third</a>, <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2010/D08-20/C:09-2154:J:Easterbrook:aut:T:fnOp:N:524994:S:0">Seventh</a> and <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1155522.html">Second Circuits</a> [opinions, PDF]. In deciding this case, the Supreme Court will determine what role causation of loss plays in the stage of certifying a class during a fraud-on-the-market securities case, which will impact the standard necessary to determine reliance in a class action securities lawsuit. 

<p>This is not the Supreme Court's only reflection on class action lawsuits and securities. Last month, the Supreme Court  <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/supreme-court-issues-ruling-in-securities-litigation-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 7-2  in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-79_h3ci.pdf">Chadbourne and Parke LLP v.

The lawsuit was brought by the victims of the multibillion dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7898924.stm">Allen Stanford</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=allen+stanford">news archive</a>]. In August a federal judge in Florida <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-against-sec-over-stanford-ponzi-scheme.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] over the agency's alleged failure to report Stanford's Ponzi scheme to the <a href="http://www.sipc.org/">Securities Investor Protection Corporation</a> (SIPC) [official website]. In June 2012 Stanford was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/financier-stanford-sentenced-to-110-years-for-ponzi-scheme.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 110 years in prison for his Ponzi scheme. The trial against Stanford began after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-rules-financier-stanford-competent-to-stand-trial.php">ruled</a> in 2011 that he was competent to stand trial, overruling a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-deems-financier-stanford-incompetent-to-stand-trial.php">previous determination</a> [JURIST reports] that his anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications rendered him unable to meaningfully contribute to his defense. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the parliament, a <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20140306/188146402/Crimeas-Parliament-Decides-to-Secede-to-Russia.html">referendum</a> [RIA Novosti report] to approve the decision to secede from Ukraine and join Russia or restore the <a href="http://www.rada.crimea.ua/en/bases-of-activity/konstituciya-ARK">1992 Crimean Constitution</a> [text], which would maintain the region as an autonomous republic within Ukraine, will be held on March 16. The ballots for the referendum in the majority ethnic Russian region will be printed in the Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar languages. Full independence for Crimea is not an option. Ukraine's interim prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25910834">Arseny Yatsenyuk</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26465962">condemned</a> [BBC report] the referendum before an emergency EU meeting in Brussels Thursday. The interim Ukrainian government in Kiev does not recognize the new Crimean government which was sworn in at an emergency session last week, and has called the vote to join the Russian Federation unconstitutional. 

<p>The ousting of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich in late February has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">led to escalating tensions</a> [BBC timeline] between Ukraine and Russia, culminating in the de facto seizure of the Crimean peninsula by pro-Russian and Russian forces. Earlier this month during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty after Russian forces had taken up positions in Ukraine. Earlier that day, Russian lawmakers <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-russia-ukraine-crimea-20140302,0,62155.story#axzz2upPi6HNC">unanimously authorized</a> [LAT report] the use of armed forces to protect their national interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine, after Russian troops had already taken positions in Crimea. At the end of February the Ukraine interim general prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-interim-government-requests-international-arrest-warrant-for-yanukovych.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that an international arrest warrant has been requested for Yanukovich, implicating him in the "mass murder" of civilians during the recent Kiev protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A special court was set up in February to try the former president, <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/india/musharrafs-lawyer-appeals-to-pak-sc-against-special-court-ruling-1422451.html?utm_source=hp-footer">denying</a> [IANS report] Musharraf's request to be tried in military court. Musharraf is <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/supreme-court-rejects-pervez-musharrafs-review-petition/448865-2.html">facing charges of treason</a> [IBN report] relating to his unconstitutional declaration of emergency in 2007. Musharraf has repeatedly delayed appearing in court, first <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/us-pakistan-musharraf-idUSBREA1H0GG20140218">based</a> [Reuters report] on fear of bomb threats and later on his failing health; he was admitted to the hospital for chest pains at the beginning of January. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26239352">Appearing</a> [BBC report] before a special three-judge panel, Musharraf was able to wave at the judges to acknowledge their presence but did not speak during the proceedings. He was reportedly present in court for only 20 minutes.

<p>Musharraf has faced a variety of legal troubles since his return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile, though until now it was unclear whether he would ever actually appear in court. He had sought to delay his appearance for medical reasons and requested his travel ban be lifted to go abroad to seek medical treatment, a request the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-denies-musharraf-request-to-go-abroad-for-medical-treatment---dnp.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] on January 31, instead issuing a "bailable" arrest warrant. Earlier in January the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that he was too sick to attend proceedings scheduled for January 16 and ordered him to appear, though he ultimately did not do so. Also currently ongoing are proceedings related to Musharraf's involvement in the 2007 Red Mosque killings and the death of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October for his role in the Red Mosque massacre after nearly six months of house arrest for the charges relating to the death of Bhutto, for which he was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Questions about the rule of law in Libya have arisen in the wake of the the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 uprising</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war that deposed Col.

Law No. 5 of 2014 imposes prison sentences on any individual "undermining the February 17 revolution" and for "publicly insulting one of the legislative, executive or judicial authorities."In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-gaddafi-and-former-officials-held-without-due-process.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Libya has failed to grant due process rights to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and other detained former government officials. Gaddafi and former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi have also faced charges of crimes against humanity before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. In October the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1663102.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] that the case against al-Senussi is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr953.aspx">inadmissible before the ICC</a> [press release] and can only be heard by domestic courts in Libya, but noted that the decision did not affect the issue with regards to the charges against Gaddafi. Back in 2011 Saadi <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mexico-authorities-disrupt-gaddafi-son-attempt-to-enter-country.php">was implicated</a> [JURIST report] in a plot to flee to Mexico by the <a href="http://www.gobernacion.gob.mx/">Secretary of the Interior</a> [official website, in Spanish].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Constitutional Court asserted that the lower court's failure to publish its detailed verdict violated a constitutional clause regarding personal freedom. The court decided to send a request to the lower court to address the issue of the former general's release. Basbug has been held in prison near Istanbul for 26 months.

<p>Basbug's has sparked protests and polarized the country between those who see it as an opportunity to unravel a network of ultra-nationalists and those who believe it is a government attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report]. In August a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/turkish-court-convicts-former-military-chief-of-plotting-to-overthrow-government.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] the country's former military chief of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced him to life in prison. Earlier that month police blocked hundreds of demonstrators from reaching the courthouse in Silivri, 25 miles west of Istanbul, in a show of solidarity with the defendants. Other high-profile defendants in the case include <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/turkish-journalist-arrested-in.php">Mustafa Balbay</a> [JURIST report], the Ankara representative of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/turkish-journalist-arrested-in.php">Cumhuriyet </a>[media website, in Turkish] newspaper, and Mehmet Haberal, a surgeon and founder of a university in Ankara.

Madigan's actions are a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-allows-same-sex-marriage-licenses-in-cook-county-illinois.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] that same-sex couples in Cook County may be issued marriage licenses immediately, rather than having to wait for the effective date of Illinois' <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/98/SB/PDF/09800SB0010lv.pdf">same-sex marriage law</a> [text, PDF] in June. The encouragement  by the Attorney General was first noted on <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/25994513-418/lisa-madigan-illinois-counties-can-allow-same-sex-marriages-now.html">Tuesday</a> [<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> report] in a letter to the <a href="http://www.co.macon.il.us/">Macon County</a> [official website] clerk's office.

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US. Recently several state attorneys general have <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/oregon-ag-refuses-to-defend-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">declined to defend</a> [JURIST report] their states' same-sex marriage bans. In February the Indiana Senate approved a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-amendment-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">prohibit same-sex marriage in the state</a> [JURIST report]. In November <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/">Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie</a> [official website]<a href="/paperchase/2013/11/hawaii-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php"> signed into law </a>[JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/splsession2013b/SB1_HD1_.pdf">bill legalizing same-sex marriage</a> [text, PDF].

The group, which included Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Frank La Rue</a>, Chair Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Members.aspx">Mads Andenas</a> and Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/SRFreedomAssemblyAssociationIndex.aspx"> Maina Kiai</a> [official profiles], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14318&LangID=E">stressed</a> [press release] that the violence needs to be investigated and that those responsible need to be held accountable. They went on to state that constructive dialogue could not begin if authorities continued to intimidate students, journalists and political leaders. UN group members expressed their readiness to visit Venezuela and aid in such talks, calling on the government to respond to their request. 

<p>This request comes only a week after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-venezuela.php">condemned </a> [JURIST report] the recent political violence in Venezuela, and urged all parties involved to move towards meaningful dialogue in hopes of resolving the situation. The statement by Pillay came shortly after the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights<a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-office-calls-for-peaceful-resolution-of-venezuela-protests.php"> called on</a> [JURIST report] all parties involved in the protests to open dialogue to resolve the situation in response to three deaths that had occurred earlier that week. Such violent demonstrations have been partially motivated by Venezuela's current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25745959">economic difficulties</a> [BBC backgrounder] and disdain towards current <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.ve/gobierno_presidente.html">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official website, in Spanish]. In September Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/venezuela-withrdraws-from-international-human-rights-court.php">withdrew </a>[JURIST report] from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights despite criticism from activists and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-high-commissioner-asks-venezuela-to-stay-in-human-rights-court.php">calls by the UN</a> [JURIST report] for the country to remain a member.

The couples, along with the civil rights advocacy group <a href="http://www.wyomingequality.org/AboutUs/AboutWyomingEquality/tabid/74/Default.aspx">Wyoming Equality</a> [advocacy website], are challenging Wyoming's <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title20/T20CH1.htm">law</a> [text] banning same-sex marriage and the state's refusal to legally recognize same-sex marriages from other states. The couples claim that the law violates the due process and equal protection guarantees of the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/constitution.aspx?file=titles/97Title97.htm">Wyoming Constitution</a> [text]. The complaint, referencing Wyoming's state motto, "Equal Rights," argues that despite Wyoming's Constitution's "more robust protection against legal discrimination than the Federal Constitution," the state excludes same-sex marriages by not legally recognizing them. This lack of recognition, the couples argue, deprive them and their children of many legal protections afforded other Wyoming families, such as spousal insurance coverage, parental rights and the right to make medical decisions for an incapacitated spouse. One of the plaintiffs, Anne Guzzo, <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/press-room/press-release/same-sex-couples-and-wyoming-equality-file-lawsuit-seeking-the-freedom-to-marry-in-wyoming/">commented,</a> [press release] "It scares me that in times of crisis we will have to rely on the kindness of strangers to respect our relationship."

<p>The Wyoming lawsuit is the latest episode in the ongoing controversy regarding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. On Tuesday a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-refuses-to-black-wisconsin-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to block Wisconsin's ban on same-sex marriage, at least until resolution of a current lawsuit challenging that state's gay-marriage ban. Kentucky's governor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kentucky-governor-to-hire-outside-counsel-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday that the state will be appealing a February federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-orders-kentucky-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">order</a> [JURIST report] requiring recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages. That ruling declared Kentucky's constitutional definition of marriage of "one man and one woman" a violation of state and federal constitutional law. Last month, a Texas district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Texas constitution, which also defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman, violates the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection and due process.

US District Judge Lucy Koh <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hpey9EEyCCZPOcHTNawc-Q2z769A?docId=0c909df4-cc7d-4b00-8ba8-9d423dffe0de">denied</a> [AFP report] Apple's request to ban 23 Samsung devices, stating that Apple had not met its burden of proof that consumer demand was driven by the infringing elements. Because of the length of the litigation and the nature of the market, no infringing Samsung units are currently in the marketplace. Though devices with these features are no longer being sold, Apple argues that an order is important to prevent Samsung from future copying with new products using the same features. Koh also issued a separate order, entering final judgment against Samsung for about $930 million in damages stemming the 2012 jury finding of patent infringement. Samsung stated that it will appeal that decision.

<p>Samsung and Apple have had <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">numerous disputes</a> [JURIST op-ed] over intellectual property in judicial forums all over the globe. The litigation <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in 2011 when both companies filed lawsuits against the other over the design and functionality of their devices. The success of either party has also varied with the forum. Last month Koh <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/samsung-denied-retrial-in-patent-dispute-with-apple.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order denying a request by Samsung for a retrial in its patent dispute with Apple, meaning that the award of $290 million in damages will stand. In November a jury <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/us-jury-awards-apple-290-million-in-patent-battle-with-samsung.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] Apple $209 million after finding that Samsung copied a number of iPhone features. That same month, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-appeals-court-orders-reconsideration-of-apples-request-for-samsung-ban.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the reconsideration of Apple's request for an injunction against Samsung products based on allegations of utility patent infringement. In October the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/obama-administration-upholds-import-ban-on-older-model-samsung-products.php">upheld a decision</a> [JURIST report] by the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/index.htm">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-trade-commission-rules-against-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung had violated patents held by Apple relating to movement tracking on touchscreen devices. In July, a Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-appeals-court-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-suit.php">found</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Samsung in a patent dispute over media-synching software.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two parties agreed on two key measures on electoral reform: to review the voter registry and to elaborate a draft law on the financing of political parties. In his statement, Subedi stated, "The matters to be discussed [. . .] are of concern to all Cambodians. Those are issues on which all Cambodians have the fundamental human right to express themselves, whether through demonstrations, marches or other means."

<p>The Cambodian government has been criticized for its response to protests in the capitol Phnom Penh. Since last year, members of the opposition have been boycotting the Cambodian National Assembly, which has led to public demonstrations and protests. The violence stemming from the public demonstrations led to the imposition of a ban against public protest in January, which was lifted in February. Subedi called for the government and opposition parties of Cambodia to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14176&LangID=E">end their ongoing political impasse</a> [text], resulting from contested July 2013 elections, and come together on human rights reforms. Also in January, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-urges-cambodia-authorities-to-show-restraint-dealing-with-protesters.php">called on Cambodian authorities to show restraint</a> [JURIST report] in dealing with protesters. That month, Cambodian police <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/cambodian-authorities-release-activists-after-labor-protests.php">released five activists</a> [JURIST report] that had been arrested for petitioning the French Embassy to release 23 demonstrators detained for opposing the Government's labor and political policies. The protests began January 3 when <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/cambodian-authorities-release-activists-after-labor-protests.php">police opened fire</a> [BBC report] on striking textile workers in Phnom Penh. Political tension has been high since the <a href="http://www.nationalrescueparty.org/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> [official website], Cambodia's opposition party, <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/cambodia-political-party-alleges-irregularities-in-election-results.php">disputed the results</a> [JURIST report] of the country's July 2013 elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26479642">conviction</a> [BBC report] makes Anwar unable to run for chief minister of Selangor in next month's election, where he was expected to win. Anwar has consistently argued that the government's allegations were a politically motivated attempt to silence his opposition to the current administration. He has already announced his plans to appeal to the country's highest court, and will remain free on bail during the course of the appeal. Should his appeal be unsuccessful, Anwar will be forced to give up his seat in Parliament to serve time in prison. He would then be disqualified from participating in any elections for five years after his release from jail. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent.

<p>Anwar has <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-denies-charges-at-sodomy-trial.php">continually denied</a> [JURIST report] the sodomy charge. The <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/?q=en">Kuala Lumpur High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/malaysia-opposition-leader-cleared-of-sodomy-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Anwar in January 2012. A Malaysian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malaysia-high-court-finds-sodomy-case-against-opposition-leader-anwar-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011 that prosecutors had enough evidence to continue to pursue the sodomy case against Anwar. The opposition leader was arrested in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">accuser</a> [JURIST reports] a month earlier. In December 2010, Anwar filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. Anwar was Malaysia's deputy prime minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A lower court ruled that JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co., Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG and Depfa Bank Plc forced the city of Milan to enter into an interest-rate swap agreement that ended up costing the city millions when the banks sold derivatives on the bonds. The appeals court <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-07/jpmorgan-ubs-convictions-overturned-in-milan-swaps-case.html">overturned</a> [Bloomberg report] this conviction. The banks negotiated new interest rates and prices on the derivatives contracts in hopes of lowering the city's borrowing costs. These banks have entered into several agreements with other cities that have also not been successful. In Milan, nine bank employees were originally sentenced to a suspended eight months in jail. These convictions were also overturned. 

<p>This is the latest development in a string of <a href="/feature/featured/bank-settlements/">JPMorgan settlements</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. A JPMorgan <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-614-million-in-mortgage-lending-settlement.php">settlement finalized</a> [JURIST report] last month agreed to pay the US government $614 million and improve company mortgage lending practices for claims it approved thousands of unqualified home mortgage loans for government insurance since 2002 and cost the government millions of dollars when the loans defaulted. In November the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/doj-finalizes-13-billion-settlement-with-jpmorgan-for-toxic-mortgages.php">finalized</a> [JURIST report] a $13 billion civil settlement with JPMorgan that resolved federal and state claims arising from the bank's risky mortgage practices that helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. In August the company <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/us-attorneys-investigating-jpmorgan-for-violation-of-federal-securities-laws.php">disclosed</a> [JURIST report] in its quarterly filing with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] that it is being investigated by both the civil and criminal divisions of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/">Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California</a> (EDC) [official website] over sales of mortgage-backed securities to investors leading up to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill is being pushed by the <a href="http://www.doc.state.al.us/">Alabama Department of Corrections</a> [official website], and <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/03/06/4747427/ala-house-approves-execution-drug.html#.UxnpNEJdVel">passed</a> [AP report] the House by a vote of 77-19. Supporters of the bill say it is necessary to protect drug suppliers from subsequent lawsuits. Opponents believe that details of state-sanctioned executions should not be kept secret, and have expressed concerns about the fact that the bill protects not just the names of the drugs manufacturers, but also makes confidential most details relating to the execution process. Several other states have adopted similar laws, many of which are currently facing legal challenges in state and federal court. 

<p>Georgia has a similar execution secrecy bill that is currently being challenged, and the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/georgia-supreme-court-to-rule-on-challenge-to-execution-drug-secrecy-law.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral arguments relating to the law's constitutionality on February 18. Many state execution protocols have been altered in response to the current shortage of the more commonly used drugs, prompting several to use new and untested drugs. An execution in Louisiana has been <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] pending a review of the new drugs to be used in the state's executions. In January the prolonged execution of an Ohio man convicted of rape and murder further <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">exacerbated</a> [JURIST report] the controversy about lethal injection drugs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Twenty-seven member states of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] <a href="http://fngeneve.um.dk/en/news/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=EB280696-2F4F-427A-A721-5963916F2CB2">released</a> [text] a joint statement expressing concern about the escalating violence in Egypt. The statement stresses the UN's concern for Egypt's restrictions on the freedom to peaceably assembly, expression and association. The declaration states that the lethal force by security officials against demonstrators is highly disproportionate and disregards Egypt's international human rights obligations. The UN member states also urged Egypt to end ongoing harassment and threats against <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/syria-iraq-egypt-deadliest-nations-for-journalists.php">dissenting journalists</a> [JURIST report] in the country. The joint declaration does praise Egypt's new constitution, but calls for the government to enforce the constitution's democratic principals, especially guaranteeing citizens due process and a fair trial. The UN countries also believe that Egypt's government should increase transparency. 

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. On Tuesday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-brands-hamas-a-terrorist-group.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Palestinian Islamist movement <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive] is a terrorist organization and banned all activities by the group within the country. In February the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-convicts-alleged-terrorist-group.php">convicted 26 people</a> [JURIST report] of forming a terrorist group with the intent to attack the Suez Canal. Two days earlier, Egypt's Prosecutor General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-refers-muslim-brotherhood-members-for-mass-criminal-tribunal.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] 504 members of the Muslim Brotherhood for a mass trial for their alleged crimes in the Day of Rage conflict. Earlier in February deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi appeared in court, but his <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/morsi-trial-adjourned-after-brief-court-appearance.php">trial was adjourned</a> [JURIST report] after the judge refused to remove the soundproof glass enclosure that Morsi was seated in. In January Egypt's Interim President Adly Mansour <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt will hold presidential elections before conducting parliamentary elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report was compiled based on interviews with 80 girls and women in six districts in southern and central Malawi. The report details how child marriage exposes girls to domestic and sexual violence. According to HRW, the practice is now so common that those girls who refuse are often threatened and abused. By the age of 18, half of the girls in Malawi will have already been married. This trend causes more problems than just the potential for abuse. The report states: <blockquote>Malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. It is ranked eighth of the countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA).... The most important reasons why child marriage in Malawi is so prevalent are poverty, teenage pregnancy, traditions and cultures that tolerate violence against girls and women and their subordination, and lack of adequate education and employment opportunities. These factors are all interlinked and heightened by a lack of strong judicial and government policy framework to ensure that existing laws designed to prevent and address child marriage are enforced.</blockquote> To remedy this, HRW is calling on Malawi to overhaul its marriage laws, including setting a minimum age, defining the term "child" and enacting legislation creating a right to education.

<p>Malawi's human rights record has been called into question on many issues. In January Malawi's <a href="http://www.judiciary.mw/index.php?option=com_content&view=featured&Itemid=101">high court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/malawi-high-court-to-review-laws-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">began hearing</a> [JURIST report] a petition challenging the country's anti-gay law. Malawi became one of 37 African nations that currently <a href="http://www.globalequality.org/component/content/article/166">has</a> [CGE backgrounder] some form of law criminalizing homosexuality when they <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-changes-position-on-suspension-of-anti-gay-laws.php">reversed their position</a> [JURIST report] on the suspension of their anti-gay laws in November 2012. In June 2012 the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-official-urges-malawi-to-improve-human-rights-conditions-accountability.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Malawi to improve its human rights conditions and promote accountability in the country. This concern specifically referred to Malawi's overcrowded prisons and slow process of justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Navalny and his supporters argue that this charge, along with his past charges, is politically based. 

<p>Russia has cracked down on dissent recently.

The crimes were committed during an attack on a village in a diamond-rich region of Congo in 2003, in which approximately 200 civilians were killed and some sexually assaulted. During a public hearing Friday, presiding judge Bruno Cotte <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr986.aspx">delivered</a> [press release] a summary of the judgment. He explained that based on the evidence presented and witness testimony, it had been established beyond a reasonable doubt that Katanga made a "significant contribution to the commission of crimes by the Ngiti militia." The court acquitted Katanga of the other charges, including sexual slavery, using child soldiers and rape. Katanga is only the second person to be convicted since the court's inception in 2002.

<p>The trial against Katanga has been ongoing for nearly six years. One of the latest developments came in 2012 when a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/netherlands-court-allows-icc-witnesses-to-seek-asylum.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that three Congolese witnesses be allowed to remain in the Netherlands to seek asylum after testifying against Katanga in the ICC. In 2010 the ICC's Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-allows-trial-of-accused-congo-militia-leader-to-continue.php">denied Katanga's request</a> [JURIST report] for stay of proceedings and declaration of unlawful detention by Congo before his transfer to The Hague. Katanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/icc-begins-trial-for-congolese.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 to three crimes against humanity and seven war crimes, including murder, sexual slavery, pillage and the use of child soldiers. In September 2009 the Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icc-upholds-charges-against-accused-drc.php">upheld the admissibility</a> [JURIST report] of Katanga's case after he argued that the charges should be dropped because he was being tried on the same crimes in Congo. The charges against Katanga were <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icc-confirms-charges-against-congolese.php">originally confirmed</a> [JURIST report] in the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Godinez-Samperio is a 26-year-old man who arrived to the US at age 9 and grew up in the Tampa area despite the expiration of his tourist visas. Godinez-Samperio attended New College of Florida and later obtained a law degree from Florida State University where he graduated with honors. Upon graduation from law school he passed both the bar exam and moral and character test. Currently, Jose is <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/florida-supreme-court-says-tampa-immigrant-cant-get-law-license/2168868">not a US citizen</a> [<em>Tampa Bay Times</em>] and remains within the country under <a href="http://immigrationequality.org/issues/immigration-basics/daca/">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) [IE backgrounder] status. The Florida Supreme Court answered the Florida Bar's question in regards to Godinez-Samperio's situation by enforcing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1621">Title 8 of the US Code</a> [text], which prohibits all immigrants from obtaining a professional license within any state.     

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years, particularly concerning young adults who were brought to the country illegally by their parents. In January the California Supreme Court ruled that an immigrant in the country illegally could be admitted to the state bar. Last month Washington state legislators <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/washington-state-lawmakers-pass-financial-aid-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to make college students who were brought to the US illegally by their parents eligible for need-based college financial aid.

HRW expressed concern over the mass detention of individuals on what they called an arbitrary basis. The call for assistance asked for trained personnel to help end the mass incarcerations as well as for help training additional judicial police. HRW has also reportedly documented "dozens" of cases of assassinations against members of the judicial system, including judges and prosecutors. None of the perpetrators of these attacks has been arrested or identified. The deteriorating security situation has caused widespread problems including the forced shutdown of local court systems and governments, as in the city of Derna, where Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani reportedly informed HRW that the court systems there have not functioned for months, as the city is not under government control. There have also been significant due process concerns related to member of the former Gaddafi government. 

<p>These concerns were given greater significance Thursday with the <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/saadi-gaddafi-extradited-from-niger-to-libya-to-stand-trial.php">extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Saadi Gaddafi, the late ex-leader's son, from Niger. Niger had previously refused to extradite him due to concerns that he would be summarily executed after arrival in the country. Early in February HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-gaddafi-and-former-officials-held-without-due-process.php">interviewed</a> [JURIST report] Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who is currently being held in Libya, saying that he and other officials had been barred from certain court proceedings and had not had the opportunity to review the evidence against them. Also in February UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-office-warns-against-libya-penal-code-amendments.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Libya over its additions to its penal codes, saying that the changes went against the "spirit" of Libya's revolution and threatened to undermine its success and legitimacy in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that 2009 reductions in funding for public education impeded the school districts' ability to "maintain, develop and operate local public schools," as required by the Kansas constitution. <a href="http://www.kslib.info/government-information/kansas-information/kansas-constitution/article-six-education.html">Article 6, Section 6(b)</a> [text] of the state's constitution requires the legislature to "make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state." The legislature <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-kansas-schools-funding-20140307,0,6001755.story#axzz2vO3qwurk">began reducing funding</a> [LA Times report] for public education in 2009 in the wake of the 2008 national economic recession. On June 17, 2010 four school districts and 31 students who attend school in those districts and their guardians filed this suit against the state, alleging that the legislature was failing to provide a suitable education to all Kansas students, consider the actual costs of education and distribute education funds equitably. The plaintiffs claimed that the reductions created wealth-based disparities among the state's various school districts. The court did not explicitly state what would constitute constitutionally sufficient funding levels, but rather remanded the case to a district court panel consisting of three judges for further factual inquiry and a reapplication of Kansas precedent with respect to the adequacy of school funding. 

<p>Public school funding continues to be a contentious issue in the US. In August 2008 the Chicago Urban League (CUL) <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chicago-group-files-challenge-to.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] insisting that Illinois' current school funding scheme be declared unconstitutional in violation of the Illinois Civil Rights Act of 2003. In January 2007 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-union.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case evaluating federal funding for public schools. Three New Mexico school districts alleged that the US Department of Education wrongly used an equalization public school funding formula distributing federal funds to public school districts equally, instead of an Impact Aid formula that allocates additional funds for school districts encompassing a significant amount of federal land, such as Indian reservations, that does not generate local tax revenue. In November 2006 the New York State Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/new-york-top-court-orders-more-nyc.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state must spend $2 billion more per year to provide children in the New York City public school system "a sound basic education" guaranteed by the state constitution. In a 4-2 decision the state's high court embraced as "reasonable" the findings of a commission that recommended spending an additional $1.93 billion per year. The court deferred to the legislature and the governor to set the exact amount of the increase. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The act declares same-sex marriages void for purposes of state law, even if they were lawfully solemnized in another state. Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/2354.htm">Attorney General Greg Zoeller</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.in.gov/activecalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=162570&information_id=196983&type=&syndicate=syndicate">announced his office's intent</a> [press release] to defend the law. Zoeller noted: <blockquote>As Indiana's Attorney General I will represent our state and defend our statute now and on any appeal to the best of my skill and ability, as I swore an oath to do. As state government&#8217;s lawyer, I must defend the state's authority to define marriage at the state level within Indiana's borders. People of goodwill have sincere differences of opinion on the marriage definition, but I hope Hoosiers can remain civil to each other as this legal question is litigated in the federal court. </blockquote> Two of the couples bringing suit wish to have their marriages that were performed in other states <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2014/03/07/indiana-couples-plan-federal-lawsuit-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage/6171287/">recognized by Indiana</a> [Indy Star report], while the other two are not married yet but would like to get married in the state.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/recognition-of-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. Earlier this month four same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit in Wyoming state court</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman. Also in March Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan encouraged county clerks statewide to <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/illionois-attorney-general-encourages-the-issuing-of-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">begin issuing marriage licenses</a> [JURIST report] to same-sex couples. During the same timeframe a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-refuses-to-black-wisconsin-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">refused to block the state's ban on same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] pending outcome of a trial. In March Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear said that the state will <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kentucky-governor-to-hire-outside-counsel-to-appeal-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">hire outside counsel</a> [JURIST report] to appeal a federal judge's order to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages to the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decree will allow the election commission to set a date for the vote, expected to take place in April, and allow candidates to begin running. The election commission's decisions will now be legally protected against any form of review. According to the new law, even a candidate running unopposed would need to receive five percent of the vote. In addition, to be eligible, a candidate must collect 25,000 signatures. The move has already received <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/criticizes-violence-egypt-protesters-22825491">criticism</a> [AP report] from opponents of the interim government. Those who oppose the measure question whether the protection of the election commission's decisions is constitutional. The government claims, however, that it is simply aimed at providing the newly elected government legitimacy.

<p>Egypt has dealt with political unrest since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began in 2011. In February deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi appeared in court, but his <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/morsi-trial-adjourned-after-brief-court-appearance.php">trial was adjourned</a> [JURIST report] after the judge refused to remove the soundproof glass enclosure that Morsi was seated in. In January Egypt's Interim President Adly Mansour <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jurist-3.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Egypt will hold presidential elections before conducting parliamentary elections. In January Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-egyptian-constitution-approved-according-to-unofficial-results.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to approve the new military-backed constitution by a margin of over 90 percent. In December the Egyptian Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-assembly-finalizes-draft-constitution-raises-election-concerns.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the finalized draft of the new constitution. The secular-based document reflects a shift in policy from the strongly Islamist-leaning document approved under former President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs in the suit, consisting of 33 lawmakers, argue that <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_21195818/federal-judge-allows-legal-challenge-tabor-go-forward">TABOR is unconstitutional</a> [Denver Post report] because it limits state spending and bars lawmakers from raising taxes without a public referendum, violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> [Cornell LII materials] guarantee that every state is to have a republican form of government rather than a direct democracy. In rejecting the state's claims that the plaintiffs lack standing, Judge Lucero wrote: <blockquote>The merits of the case are not before us. We express no view on the substantive issues and intend none. We consider solely standing and the political question doctrine: whether these plaintiffs have suffered particularized injury not widely shared by the general populace that entitles them to have their case heard by the federal courts . . . We conclude that these plaintiffs may bring their claims and that the political doctrine question does not bar our consideration.</blockquote> The merits of the lawsuit will be addressed by the lower court unless the state decides to continue to appeal the standing issue.

<p>The result of this lawsuit could potentially have an impact on other challenges to similar legislation in other states that have passed similar referendum requirements for tax issues. For example, <a href="https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/misc/4058C.pdf">California's Taxpayer Bill of Rights</a> [backgrounder, PDF], which requires two-thirds approval by a referendum before any local government can levy a tax designed to raise revenue for a specific purpose, could face a challenge. The <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/Home.aspx">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [official website] originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-allows-colorado-taxpayers-bill-of-rights-challenge-to-proceed.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] Colorado's legislators to challenge TABOR in January of 2012, giving rise to the most recent appeal in this case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

China's legislature, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=npc">National People's Congress</a> (NPC) [JURIST news archive], on Sunday announced measures that would subject less crimes to capital punishment if passed. Various government departments are reportedly beginning to <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/96211/World/International/With-legal-reforms,-China-wants-less-interfering-i.aspx">study the topic</a> [Reuters report] by bringing in legal scholars on the subject. Capital punishment currently applies to 55 different offenses in China. Human rights groups say that <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/01/china-fails-to-deliver-on-human-rights-promises-hrw.php">China overuses the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], specifically for non-violent crimes like fraud and illegal money-laundering. The government is not, however, considering dropping the death penalty for crimes of corruption. The <a href="http://duihua.org/wp/">Dui Hua Foundation</a> [advocacy website] estimated that 3000 people were executed in China in 2012, compared to 43 in the US. 

<p>This is not the first time the NPC has limited the number of crimes subject to death penalty. In 2011 the NPC amended the national criminal law to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/china-drops-death-penalty-for-13-non-violent-crimes.php">remove 13 offenses</a> [JURIST report] from the list of crimes subject to the death penalty. Those removed were non-violent economic crimes, including smuggling cultural relics, precious metals and rare animals; fraudulent activities with financial bills and letters of credit; fraudulent export tax refunds; teaching of crime-committing methods; and robbing ancient cultural ruins. During those negotiations though, China still <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-not-considering-eliminating-death-penalty-for-corruption.php">never considered removing the death penalty for crimes of corruption</a> [JURIST report]. The number of people executed has dropped however. According to <a href="http://www.handsoffcain.info/">Hands Off Cain</a> [advocacy group], China executed 5000 people in 2009. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An administrative judge for the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) [official website], <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/legal/geraghty.html">Patrick Geraghty</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.kramerlevin.com/files/upload/PirkerDecision.pdf">dismissed</a> [text, PDF] a fine brought by the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) [official website] against a drone operator Thursday. The ruling effectively <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/faa-small-drones-ban-104393.html">strikes down</a> [Politico report] the FAA's bans on the use of commercial drones put in place in 2007. Geraghty found that the ban was not enforceable because the FAA did not comport with an official rule-making process before it issued the rule. With this decision, it is now legal to use drones at a low altitude for commercial purposes. On Friday the FAA announced their intent to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/07/us-usa-aircraft-drones-idUSBREA261PY20140307">appeal</a> [Reuters report] the decision in order to maintain safety for airliners. The FAA <a href="http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=15894">stated</a> [press release] that its appeal "will have the effect of staying the decision" until the independent safety board decides on the case. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/drones/">Drone use</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue both in terms of small domestic drones and larger drones being used abroad by the military. In October, UN experts urged the international community to have <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-accountability-transparency-in-use-of-drones.php">greater accountability</a> [JURIST report] and transparency when it comes to the use of drones. A week earlier, the UN released a report showing that the US had <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-report-claims-us-drone-strikes-have-killed-more-than-publicly-stated.php">killed more people</a> [JURIST report] using drone strikes than it publicly claimed to have killed. A month earlier, the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/fbi-use-of-unmanned-drones-revealed.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing its plans for the use of unmanned drones in future missions. In August, the UN stated that if the US is to use drones they <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-us-drone-strikes-must-comply-with-international-law.php">must comply</a> [JURIST report] with international law. In March, a US appeals court overruled a lower court ruling and held that the Central Intelligence Agency is <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">required to officially acknowledge</a> [JURIST report] whether or not it has records pertaining to the use of unmanned drones. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The elections are held at five-year intervals and are considered more a formality than an actual democratic process, as constituents <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26502900">vote</a> [BBC report] "yes" or "no" for the single, party-approved candidate for their district. The Supreme People's Assembly is considered a "rubber-stamp" parliamentary body, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/03/north-koreans-vote-new-national-council-2014395462960301.html">meeting</a> [Al Jazeera report] only a few times per year to give their approval to programs and laws developed by the Worker's Party. The elections are seen by foreign observers as having a twofold purpose, first to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/world/asia/north-korea.html?_r=0">consolidate</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] the power of top officials and to elevate supporters to powerful positions, and second to act as a de facto "political census" of the people. Propaganda initiatives strongly encourage all citizens to vote and to do so in favor of the Worker's Party. North Korean officials reported a voter turnout of 99.98 percent.

<p>North Korea is considered one of the most secretive nations on the planet and has a controversial human rights records. In February the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-urges-action-in-north-korea.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the international community to take action in North Korea, saying that there were "no longer any excuses for inaction." The statement came two days after the release of a 372 page report by UN human rights investigators calling for the nation to be brought before the ICC, detailing numerous accounts of crimes against humanity, <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-north-korea-rights-violations-may-constitute-crimes-against-humanity.php">including</a> [JURIST report] "murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, the enforced disappearance of people and knowingly causing starvation." North Korea categorically rejected the report, claiming that it was a fabrication designed to hurt the nation's political leaders. In December Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/ai-north-korea-continues-expansion-of-political-prison-system.php">released</a> [JURIST report] satellite images confirming an expansion of North Korea's political prison systems, calling upon the country to immediately close the camps and release prisoners. It is unclear the exact number of political prisoners being detained there. UN officials began <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">advocating</a> [JURIST report] an international inquiry in North Korea's political prison system in February 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A similar sentence along with a smaller fine was <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/oman/ex-officials-of-oman-s-galfar-get-15-years-and-hefty-fines-1.1301545">given</a> [Gulf News report] to Ali's deputy for being found guilty of being a direct accomplice. Ali was formerly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-oman-corruption-sentences-idUSBREA280I020140309">sentenced</a> [Reuters report] to three years in jail in January for bribes paid to Petroleum Development Oman, allegedly to encourage contracts to be awarded to his company. These trials are part of an ongoing effort by Omani officials to eliminate corruption and graft in the nation's industries. Other former high officials have been convicted as well, including the CEO of the state-owned Oman Oil Company, sentenced to 23 years in prison for accepting bribes, laundering funds and abusing his office. Ali was not present in court when his sentence was handed down and has reportedly vowed to appeal the sentence and conviction. 

<p>The Omani government has been cracking down on pro-reform and human rights activists as well as political opponents, in addition to suspected of graft.

The commission members were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26508259">tried</a> [BBC report] after the passage of new rules that allowed the Supreme Court to initiate the proceedings. The rules enabled the court to essentially act as prosecutor, judge and jury during the trial. The <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/uk-maldives-supremecourt-idUKBREA2900W20140310">charges resulted from</a> [Reuters report] officials failing to follow election guidelines in allowing a presidential run-off after three previous attempts had been postponed or annulled by the court, and for disbanding eight political parties ahead of a parliamentary election this month. In a trial of two members of the commission last month, the court stated that the men must bear responsibility for "disobeying and challenging" Supreme Court judgements and orders, which were issued in its capacity as "the guardian of the constitution." The country's first democratically elected president, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Nasheed">Mohamed Nasheed</a>, who was ousted in 2012 and lost a November run-off to current president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdulla+Yameen">Abdulla Yameen</a> [JURIST news archives], criticized the judgments and has called on Maldivians citizens to protest. The election observation team from the EU said that the verdict would be studied carefully.

<p>The judiciary in the Maldives has faced recent criticism. In November the Supreme Court of the Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/maldives-high-court-delays-presidential-election-for-third-time.php">suspended </a>[JURIST report] the nation's presidential election for the third time. In October UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-chief-accuses-maldives-court-of-interfering-in-election.php">asserted</a> [JURIST report] that the Supreme Court of the Maldives has meddled excessively in the nation's presidential elections. Last February the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-maldives-judges-lawyer-facing-outside-pressure.php">found that lawyers and judges in the Maldives are not adequately independent</a> [JURIST report] from outside influence and called for a separation of powers between the parliament and court system. Earlier that month a Maldives court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">issued a second arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former president Nasheed on charges of the illegal detention of a judge. The charges against Nasheed stemmed from his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges last January, when Nasheed was still president. In 2012 Amnesty International<a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ai-urges-investigation-of-maldives-human-rights-violations.php"> revealed violent human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] committed in the Maldives against opposition groups and called for an immediate independent investigation into the actions of security forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled "Squeezing the Life Out of Yarmouk: War Crimes Against Besieged Civilians," <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/syria-yarmouk-under-siege-horror-story-war-crimes-starvation-and-death-2014-03-10">discusses the deaths</a> [press release] of nearly 200 people since the tightening of the siege and cutting off of access to food and medical supplies in July, with 128 of those deaths caused by starvation. The report also states that government forces and government allies have repeatedly attacked civilian buildings, such as schools, hospitals and mosques in Yarmouk. AI's regional director, Philip Luther, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-syria-crisis-amnesty-idUSBREA290JB20140310">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the siege of Yarmouk amounted to "collective punishment of the civilian population," going on to say that the Syrian government must end the siege immediately and allow humanitarian efforts access to assist the citizens. Despite efforts by the <a href="http://www.unrwa.org/">UN Relief and Works Agency</a> (UNRWA) [official website] to provide aid during January and February, attempts to reach a truce in Yarkmouk to allow for food deliveries to the starving people have <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/rights-group-accuses-syria-government-war-crime-084209581.html">repeatedly collapsed</a> [AP report]. 

<p>The Syrian Civil War has persisted for almost three years. The conflict has been highlighted by countless human rights violations and use of chemical weaponry, which has created mounting pressure among the international community to find an end to the conflict. Earlier this month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic </a>[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/international-community-must-respond-to-syria-crisis-un.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to respond to recent and reoccurring crimes against humanity perpetrated by both government and non-government entities. In February, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-syria-un-rights-experts.php">reported </a>[JURIST report] that both sides have been committing human rights violations. The day before, Syria <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/syria-signs-agreement-to-dispose-of-chemical-weapons.php">agreed </a>[JURIST report] to dispose of their chemical weapons. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to the Security Council, which highlights the severe suffering faced by children in Syria during the period between March 2011 and November 2013. The report states that the Syrian government and military allies have killed and tortured extensive numbers of children, while opposition forces have recruited children to aid in combat and have summarily executed children, as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts leaned heavily on the court's 1942 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7805902297301602875">Great Northern Railway Co. v.

The court's decision is restricted to rights of way abandoned before October 1988, when Congress passed a law clarifying that such lands would return to federal ownership once abandoned by the railroads. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion.

Bernard Acho Muna, the chairperson of the three-person inquiry and a former prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> [official website], has <a href="http://www.dw.de/un-launches-probe-into-human-rights-violations-in-central-african-republic/a-17485596">said</a> [DW report] that the situation in CAR is similar to that of Rwanda in the weeks leading to the Rwandan genocide, and worries that the collapse of law and order in CAR could be a precursor to genocide. The Commission, which is expected in CAR on Tuesday, will submit its initial findings to the Security Council within six months.

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital last March. In February, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-car-leaders-personally-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">prompted</a> [JURIST report] CAR leaders to remember their legal obligations and stressed that they are personally accountable for human rights violations. Also that month, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ethnic-cleansing-occurring-in-central-african-republic-ai.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to take immediate and effective action to halt the spread of sectarian violence and "ethnic cleansing" within the western part of the CAR. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also in January the UN reported that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in CAR. Earlier in January the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House <a href="http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVa-Senate-Passes-Abortion-Limits-Bill-249165211.html">passed the bill</a> [AP report] by a vote of 85-15 with two delegates not participating. The bill passed the West Virginia Senate a few days earlier, and the legislation now awaits approval from <a href="http://www.governor.wv.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Earl Ray Tomblin</a> [official website] before it becomes law. West Virginia is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/03/10/west-virginias-legislature-passes-a-20-week-abortion-ban/">first Democrat-controlled state legislature</a> [WP report] to pass a 20-week ban on abortion, joining a Republican-backed effort that has enacted similar abortion laws in 10 states across the US. 

<p>The debate over 20-week abortion bans is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. A number of states have proposed laws to make abortions illegal after 20-weeks and the US government has grappled with the constitutionality of a federal law banning abortion procedures 20 weeks after conception. In February the Mississippi House <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/-the-mississippi-house-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 20-week abortion ban law. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rule on Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week ban on abortions after having been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">stuck down</a> [JURIST report] on constitutional grounds by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last May. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a federal law banning 20-week abortions in June 2013 but the bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/sen-lindsey-graham-introduces-abortion-bill/">failed</a> [Washington Post report] to gain widespread support in the Democratic-controlled US Senate because many representatives believe such a law would violate women's rights.     </p>]]></content:encoded>

President Yoweri Museveni <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/uganda-president-signs-anti-gay-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] last month, which imposes life sentences for those convicted of "aggravated homosexuality." The <a href="http://news.iafrica.com/worldnews/906984.html">petitioners</a> [AFP report], led by the <a href="http://www.ugandans4rights.org/">Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law</a> [advocacy website], said that the law's passage has resulted in violence and retaliation against gays. In additional to having the law declared unconstitutional, petitioners are also seeking to block media outlets from publishing names of people suspected of homosexuality.

The legislation originally called for the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality," but that provision was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-to-drop-death-penalty-from-bill-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] in 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 51-page report, filed in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], argues that objections to the merger by consumer groups are without merit. Pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/16">15 USC &#167;16 (b)-(h)</a> [text], DOJ antitrust remedies must be vetted in public comments and approved by a federal judge before being finalized. US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly is presiding over the review. The DOJ's filing defended the remedy as a "major victory for American consumers" that "will enable Low Cost Carriers ('LCC's) to fly millions of new passengers per year to destinations throughout the country." The filing cited newly obtainable airline slot and gate access at Reagan National Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport and Dallas Love Field. Lastly, the DOJ argues the remedy for the divested LCC slots valued at $425 million is unprecedented in the airline industry and among the most substantial merger remedies in any industry.

<p>The proposed <a href="feature/2013/12/us-airways-and-american-airlines-merger.php">US Airways and American Airlines Merger</a> [JURIST backgrounder] was first announced in February 2013. Last month JURIST Guest Columnist Laura Gallagher of the UC Davis School of Law <a href="/dateline/2014/01/lauara-gallagher-airline-merger.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] the nature of the airline industry makes it desirable for large airlines to merge without raising serious monopoly concerns. In December the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-application-staying-airline-merger.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an application to stay the merger of American Airlines and US Airways without an opinion. In November the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/american-airlines-us-airways-settle-doj-antitrust-suit.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a settlement of the antitrust lawsuit opposing the airline merger.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ukraine's parliament, <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20140311/188317029/Crimea-Declares-Independence-Ahead-of-Popular-Vote-on-Secession.html">calling</a> [RIA Novosti report] the Crimean referendum unconstitutional and violative of international law, warned Crimea to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/11/ukraine-parliament-ultimatum-crimea-referendum">cancel the referendum</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] by Wednesday or face dissolution. Crimea, a region within the Ukraine of majority Russian ethnicity, insists its declaration of independence does not violate international law, citing a 2010 ruling by the International Court of Justice ratifying Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia. The Crimean Parliament <a href="http://www.rada.crimea.ua/en/">website</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.rada.crimea.ua/en/news/11_03_2014_1">reported</a> [press release] that of the 81 deputies of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea that voted, 78 approved the declaration. The website also <a href="http://www.rada.crimea.ua/en/news/09_03_14">reported</a> [press release] that Crimean citizens overwhelmingly support secession and have taken to the streets throughout the region to rally support. Ukraine's legislature, conversely, is urging Crimeans not to participate in the referendum, asserting that, constitutionally, Ukraine's central government is the only legitimate authority that can oversee foreign affairs.

<p>Crimea's cry for independence is the latest incident escalating <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">tensions</a> [BBC timeline] in the region. Protests erupted in Crimea last month decrying the recent ousting of Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovich and campaigning for annexation with Russia. Russian forces quickly moved in to control the region allegedly to protect their national interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's use of armed forces calling it a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. Last week the Crimean Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-sets-referendum-to-become-part-of-the-russian-federation.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] permission from the Russian government to join its Federation. The pro-Russian Crimean Parliament <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2014/03/11/ukraines-increasing-polarization-and-the-western-challenge/">denies</a> [Forbes report] the legitimacy of Ukraine's new pro-western government which has issued a warrant for Yanukovich's arrest for the killing of civilians during protests in Ukraine's capital of Kiev.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three Americans are CIA agents who participated in the kidnapping of terror suspect <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nasr">Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive] on a Milan street. The final ruling made by the Italian courts comes after a series of trials spanning six-and-a-half years. The evidence produced against the agents was a result of Italian detective work which discovered documents and cellular records linked to the kidnapping. Of the three CIA agents, Rome station chief Jeff Castelli was given a seven-year sentence while the other two received a six-year sentence.           </p>

<p>The rendition of Nasr has resulted in substantial judicial activity in Italy. In February Italy's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/italy-high-court-overturns-convictions-in-cia-extradition-program.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of five Italian agents related to the abduction and extraordinary rendition of Nasr. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International">five agents</a> [AP report] included the former chief of Italy's <a href="http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/">SISMI Intelligence service</a> [official website, in Italian], Nicolo Pollari, his deputy, and three other agents. Pollari was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/milan-court-convicts-italian-spy-chief-for-role-in-cias-extraordinary-rendition-program.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by a Milan court of appeals in February 2013 to 10 years in prison. In December an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/milan-court-convicts-italian-spy-chief-for-role-in-cias-extraordinary-rendition-program.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Nasr to six years in prison after being convicted <em>in absentia</em> of terror charges. Last September a former Italian intelligence chief <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-cia-chief-requests-pardon-from-italy-president.php">requested a pardon</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.quirinale.it/qrnw/statico/ex-presidenti/Napolitano_1/nap-biografia1.htm">Italian President Giorgio Napolitano</a> [official website, in Italian] after a US Air Force Colonel was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/italy-pardons-us-colonel-in-cia-extraordinary-rendition-case.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a pardon in April from Napolitano.

Hassan's attorney <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/3/11/yemeni-guantanamoinmatetakesoninhumaneforcefeedingspractices.html">argues</a> [Al Jazeera report] that the force-feeding procedures amount to torture and says that he hopes the lawsuit will force the military to hand over documents regarding detainee policies and procedures. 

<p>The treatment of prisoners at <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has raised human rights concerns internationally, and, in recent months, the US has <a href="/forum/2013/11/jeffrey-addicott-ghailani-combatant.php">grappled</a> [JURIST op-ed] with the complexities of the laws of war and the due process rights of detainees. In January <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/obama-urges-closure-of-guantanamo-this-year.php">reiterated</a> [JURIST report] his commitment to closing the military prison by the end of 2014 as the US shifts away from a "permanent war footing." That same month, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/amnesty-international-demands-closure-of-guantanamo-bay.php">demanding</a> [JURIST report] that the US close Guantanamo, calling the prison's continued operation a "prime example of the US' double standard on human rights."

Security Service Bill (amendment No. 19), 2014, also known as the Enlistment Bill and the Equal Service Bill, was approved in its third reading by a vote of 65-1, with opposition parties boycotting the vote. The legislation requires that ultra-Orthodox Jews either join the army or perform civilian service and includes imprisonment for those attempting to evade conscription. The new law will take effect in 2017.

<p>The Israeli Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/israel-cabinet-approves-conscription-law-reform.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in July.

The House version of the bill that was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/-the-mississippi-house-of.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] last month would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Though the House bill <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2014/03/11/5408163/mississippi-senate-passes-amended.html">calculated</a> [AP report] pregnancy as beginning when the embryo implants itself in the uterus, the Senate amended its version at the last minute to change the calculation from when a woman's last menstrual period ended. Senator Joey Fillingale stated that the change is meant to align the bill with those enacted in neighboring states such as Texas and Louisiana. Before becoming law, the bill will have to go to a House-Senate conference in order to reconcile the differences.

<p>Since abortion became legal in 1973, <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/detail.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US have been controversial, with many states enacting measures to restrict access to abortion. In recent years, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/arkansas-abortion-law-challenged.php">Arkansas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/texas-urges-supreme-court-to-allow-restrictive-abortion-law-to-remain-in-effect.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports] have passed laws similar to the one currently being debated in Mississippi. Earlier this week lawmakers in West Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/west-virginia-lawmakers-approve-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. In January the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined to review</a> Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week abortion ban after it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] last May.

Andrea Prasow, senior national security counsel and advocate at HRW, claims that "the US review is the perfect time for the Human Rights Committee to make clear that mass communications surveillance, whether against a country's own citizens or another country's, violates basic rights."

Section 9.44.050 of Sunnyvale <a href="http://qcode.us/codes/sunnyvale/revisions/3027-13.pdf">Ordinance No. 3027-13</a> [text, PDF] defines "large-capacity magazine" to mean "any detachable ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than ten (10) rounds." The <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/SanJoseCourthouseInformation">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> and the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official websites] previously denied requests to block enforcement of the ban. Applicants of the injunction argued that "firearms equipped with magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds are highly effective for self-defense." They also stated that the refusal to grant an injunction could lead to "potentially deadly consequences in a self-defense emergency." In a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Sunnyvale-response-3-12-14.pdf">response</a> [text, PDF] to the injunction request, attorneys for the respondents argued that the applicants "are merely attempting to circumvent the appeals process by asking this Court to prejudge the very issues that are now before the Ninth Circuit in this appeal." The ordinance went into effect in December and will ultimately be litigated before the Ninth Circuit. 

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states have enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have led to subsequent litigation. In February California Attorney General Kamala Harris <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/california-ag-asks-federal-court-to-reverse-decision-striking-down-gun-control-laws.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit urging the court to reverse its decision that struck down a law requiring residents to show good cause to carry a concealed firearm. Earlier in February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-gun-rights-cases.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] three new petitions that would address the scope of the Second Amendment. In January a federal district court in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's new <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">gun control law</a> [JURIST report]. That same month a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/chicago-gun-sales-ban-ruled-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] part of Chicago's gun ordinance banning the licensed sale of firearms in the city. Also in January a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-most-of-new-york-gun-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] most of state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">new gun control law</a> [JURIST report], among the most restrictive in the country, but struck down a provision prohibiting owners to load more than seven rounds into a magazine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mendez noted the hypocrisy of governments that condemn torture committed by another country while continuing to accept products and information from them. He stated that the justification behind the complete prohibition of torture and also of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text] includes the objective of "removing any incentive to undertake torture anywhere in the world." Mendez also explained that the affirmative obligation of a government to prevent torture includes the measures that the government takes to prevent torture and ill-treatment within another country. He noted that "[i]t is not sufficient to ensure that the judicial process is free from the taint of torture. Torture must not be encouraged, condoned, or acquiesced in all manifestations of public power, executive and judicial." Mendez also stated the importance of governments being aware of the fact that receiving, sharing and collecting any information tainted by ill-treatment or torture are acts which are subject to international law.

<p>Despite attempts by the UN and various advocacy groups to eradicate torture among the international community, it still remains a constant and unyielding problem in a number of countries. In February Mendez <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-expert-urges-tajikistan-to-end-torture-and-ill-treatment.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Tajikistan government to implement policies and laws that have been previously adopted by the government in order to end torture and ill-treatment within the country. Earlier that month Human Rights Watch released a report outlining the prevalent <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/hrw-report-traffickers-torturing-eritreans-in-sudan-and-egypt.php">trafficking and torture</a> [JURIST report] of Eritrean refugees for ransom by Sudanese and Egyptian individuals that has been occurring since 2010. In January the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-office-calls-for-ukraine-torture-probe.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into torture allegations against Ukraine following widespread arrests of protesters, which have since been offered amnesty. In December lawyers for two Guantanamo detainees, arguing before the European Court of Human Rights, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/guantanamo-detainees-accuse-poland-in-cia-rendition-torture.php">accused Poland</a> [JURIST report] of serving as a secret torture site for the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fTEXT%2bTA%2b20140313%2bTOC%2bDOC%2bXML%2bV0%2f%2fEN&language=EN">resolution</a> [texts adopted] states that Russia is in breach of international law and existing conventional obligations, including the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a>, the <a href="http://www.osce.org/mc/39501">OSCE Helsinki Final Act</a>, the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/001.htm">Statute of the Council of Europe</a>, the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/arms-control-disarmament-and-nonproliferation/budapest-memorandums-security-assurances-1994/p32484">1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances</a> [texts], the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation and many others. The resolution also rejects the planned referendum on joining the Russian Federation to be held Sunday in Crimea, finding it to be in violation of both the Budapest Memorandum and the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/constitution.html">Ukrainian constitution</a> [text]. Both sources of law restrict the Autonomous Republic of Crimea to holding referendums on local matters do not permit referendums "on modifying the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine." The European Parliament declared Russia's stated objective for deploying troops in Crimea, the protection of the Ukraine's Russian minority, to be unfounded. The European Parliament also called on the Ukrainian government to protect the rights of the nation's minorities. 

<p>The ousting of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich in late February has led to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">escalating tensions</a> [BBC timeline] between Ukraine and Russia, culminating in the de facto seizure of the Crimean peninsula by pro-Russian and Russian forces at the beginning of March. Earlier this week Crimea's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-votes-to-become-independent-state-via-referendum.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to secede from the Ukraine and declare itself an independent state in the event of a yes vote in a referendum scheduled for Sunday. The vote comes a week after the Crimean Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-sets-referendum-to-become-part-of-the-russian-federation.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Russian government to allow the region to become part of the Russian Federation through a referendum. Earlier this month during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's violation of Ukrainian sovereignty after Russian forces had taken up positions in Ukraine. The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has generated much academic discussion including two JURIST op-eds by <a href="/forum/2014/03/curtis-doebbler-ukraine-hypocrisy.php">Curtis Doebbler</a>  of the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, and <a href="/forum/2014/03/stoyan-panov-ukraine-icc.php">Stoyan Panov</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the University of Birmingham Law School.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The action challenges the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Constitution#A1S27">Article I, Sec. 27</a> [text] of the Florida Constitution and <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0700-0799/0741/Sections/0741.212.html">Sec. 741.212, Fla. Stat.</a> [text], which prohibit Florida from recognizing the marriages of same-sex couples that were entered into in other jurisdictions.

<p>The heated debate over <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most polarizing issues currently facing the American legal community, with legal challenges currently before numerous state and federal courts. Last week four Indiana same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/couples-challenge-indiana-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state in the <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] seeking to strike down the state's Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional. In the same week four same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Wyoming state court challenging the constitutionality of the state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman.

The court also <a href="http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/03/14/world/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-musharraf/386753.html">directed</a> [AP report] the government to ensure Musharraf's safety when he travels to court. Musharraf has been charged with treason related to his suspension of the constitution and use of emergency powers in 2007. Musharraf has repeatedly delayed appearing in court, first <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/18/us-pakistan-musharraf-idUSBREA1H0GG20140218">based</a> [Reuters report] on fear of bomb threats and later on his failing health. He was hospitalized for chest pains at the beginning of January.

<p>Musharraf has faced a variety of legal troubles since his return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile. Earlier this month, Musharraf <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/musharraf-appeals-denial-of-military-court-trial.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court challenging the decision not to allow Musharraf's high treason charge to be tried in military court. He made his <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/musharraf-makes-first-appearance-in-pakistan-court.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] in front of the court in February. He had sought to delay his appearance for medical reasons and requested his travel ban be lifted to go abroad to seek medical treatment, a request the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-denies-musharraf-request-to-go-abroad-for-medical-treatment---dnp.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] on January 31, instead issuing a "bailable" arrest warrant. Earlier in January the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that he was too sick to attend proceedings scheduled for January 16 and ordered him to appear, though he ultimately did not do so. Also currently ongoing are proceedings related to Musharraf's involvement in the 2007 Red Mosque killings and the death of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Musharraf has also been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of Bhutto. Bhutto was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/pakistan.bhutto/index.html">killed at a rally</a> [CNN report] addressing a large crowd of her supporters when a bomb exploded near her vehicle. Bhutto's death came just two weeks after a failed assassination attempt, and prosecutors have accused Musharraf of failing to provide adequate security protection for her. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October for his role in the Red Mosque massacre after nearly six months of house arrest for the charges relating to the death of Bhutto, for which he was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The residency requirement of the law <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-syria-crisis-election-idUSBREA2D0HE20140314">effectively bars</a> [Reuters report] many members of Syrian opposition groups, many of whom are living in exile. Members of the main opposition group within Syria, the<a href="http://www.etilaf.org/en/"> Syrian National Coalition</a> [official website], are especially affected, as the group is based out of Istanbul. Tolerated opposition groups in Damascus appear to be the only opposition parties with potential eligible candidates, though they have little popular support. President Bashar al-Assad has not announced whether or not he will run for a third term in July. However, the new law makes reelection more likely. Introduced as amendments to the constitution approved in a referendum two years ago, the legislation also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hndmGRoOKnGQCgO7ilXleZ00B1Cw?docId=cf15c7c7-6607-4965-ba6f-75f7ee64d13b">includes</a> [AFP report] provisions requiring candidates to be at least 40 years old, to hold Syrian citizenship only, to be a child of Syrian citizens and married only to a Syrian citizen and to be free of criminal convictions. Opposition parties have not announced any intentions to run in the upcoming elections.

<p>Both sides of the Syrian conflict have been accused of war crimes in violation of international law. The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting Assad's regime, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this month <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/rights-group-accuses-syria-government-of-war-crimes.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Assad's forces of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity on Palestinian and Syrian civilians in Yarmouk, on the outskirts of Damascus. Also this month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/international-community-must-respond-to-syria-crisis-un.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to respond to recent and reoccurring crimes against humanity perpetrated by both government and non-government entities. Last year <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/hrw-syria-government-likely-used-chemical-weapons.php">reported</a> that the Syrian government is likely responsible [JURIST report] for the August 21 chemical weapon attacks. Also last year UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-calls-for-negotiations-to-end-syria-conflict.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to help facilitate negotiations between warring parties in Syria. Commentators have <a href="/forum/2013/09/curtis-doebbler-force-syria.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the use of military force against Syria would constitute a violation of international law.

Article XI Section 18 of <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/about/docs/TN-Constitution.pdf">Tennessee's constitution</a> [text, PDF], also known as the Anti-Recognition Law, prohibits the state from recognizing any out-of-state marriage other than a union between one man and one woman. The three same-sex couples sought an injunction against the Anti-Recognition Law pending the final outcome in the case. Judge Aleta Trauger granted the injunction, explaining that recent case law on same-sex marriage indicates that the couples will likely win on the merits:<blockquote>First, the nature of a preliminary injunction remedy is just that--preliminary. It is not a final judgment on the merits of a case. Instead, it preliminarily enjoins a party (here, effectively, the State of Tennessee) from engaging in a particular action until the court can rule on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims at a later stage, typically with the benefit of more evidence and legal authority. In making its decision, the court must decide, among other things, whether the plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims, not that they have prevailed or that they necessarily will prevail on their claims. ... Currently, all relevant federal authority indicates that the plaintiffs in this case are indeed likely to prevail on their claims that the Anti-Recognition Law [is] unconstitutional.</blockquote>It is unclear when Trauger will issue a final decision.

<p>This is the latest episode in the ongoing controversy regarding <a href="/feature/2013/07/same-sex-marriage-1.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. On Thursday the <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Florida's refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages.

Judge Susan Webber Wright <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">temporarily blocked Act 301 last year</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-to-proceed.php">allowed</a> [JURIST reports] a challenge against the law to proceed. On Friday, Wright struck down the law, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/15/judge-strikes-down-arkansas-abortion-law-12-weeks#start-of-comments">declaring</a> [AP report] that abortions cannot be restricted until a fetus reaches viability, which is typically around 22-24 weeks. Wright also emphasized that doctors, rather than legislators, should determine when viability occurs. However, Wright left in place a part of the law that requires doctors to check for a fetal heartbeat.

<p>Abortion continues to be a hot-button legal, political and moral issue within the ongoing debate over <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. A number of states have proposed laws to make abortions illegal after 20 weeks. Last week the West Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/west-virginia-lawmakers-approve-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit abortions later than 20 weeks after conception. In February the Mississippi House <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/-the-mississippi-house-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 20-week abortion ban. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined</a> to rule on Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week ban on abortions after having it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">stuck down</a> [JURIST reports] on constitutional grounds by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit last May. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a federal law banning 20-week abortions in June, but the bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/sen-lindsey-graham-introduces-abortion-bill/">failed</a> [WP report] to gain widespread support in the Democratic-controlled US Senate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Simbikangwa was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/04/us-france-rwanda-trial-idUSBREA130VC20140204">charged</a> [Reuters report] with arming and directing Hutu extremists in the violence that claimed the lives of an estimated half a million ethnic Tutsi. He was arrested in 2008 while in hiding on the French island of Mayotte. The current president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, has accused France of supporting the Hutu militia and harboring fugitives who fled to France in the years following the genocide.

<p>France has only recently joined the US and other European nations in trying and extraditing individuals accused of having aided or been complicit in the Rwandan genocide.

Calling the issues of the country the "most daunting set of challenges for decades," Pillay stressed the importance of human rights protections as the country transitions to democracy. Regarding the violence of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Boko+Haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive] in the north east, Pillay stated that it is "vital that government forces do not exacerbate the problem by taking actions that displace, endanger or kill civilians." Pillay stated that to combat widespread corruption, everyone must "pull together, and push each other, to tackle this scourge, which is holding back the development of the country, and undermining many people's social and economic rights." After commending the country's efforts to combat human trafficking, Pillay expressed her concern for a number of groups, specifically women and children, that still remain vulnerable to human rights violations.

<p>Friday's remarks were not the first call to improve Nigerian human rights protections. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] in October urged the Nigerian government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/ai-nigeria-must-investigate-detainee-deaths.php">investigate the deaths</a> [JURIST report] of hundreds of people detained by the country's military Joint Task Force.

The referendum has been condemned as illegal by the US and other European countries. On Saturday, Russia <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47362&Cr=Ukraine&Cr1=#.UyXNG15N2P0">vetoed</a> [UN News Centre report] a UN Security Council motion declaring the Crimea referendum invalid. The UN resolution was backed by 13 members, with China abstaining from voting before it was vetoed by Russia. If Crimea passes the referendum, Russia will face international sanctions from Western nations. The Crimea polls opened at 8 AM local time on Sunday and will continue until 8 PM. Results are expected to be announced Sunday evening. 

<p>Crimea's cry for independence is the latest incident <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">escalating tensions</a> [BBC timeline] in the region.

Protests erupted in Crimea last month decrying the recent ousting of Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovich and campaigning for annexation with Russia. Russian forces quickly moved in to control the region allegedly to protect their national interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's use of armed forces calling it a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A class action <a href="http://content.clearchannel.com/cc-common/mlib/1229/03/1229_1394875489.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in federal court in Texas on Friday against <a href="http://www.gm.com/">General Motors</a> (GM) [corporate website] claiming that customers' vehicles have lost value due to ignition problems blamed for a series of fatal crashes. The complaint alleges that GM knew about the problem since 2004 but failed to fix it, creating unreasonably dangerous conditions for drivers of the affected models. Plaintiffs are seeking damages from GM for the loss of use of their vehicle and repairs and diminished resale value. "Everyone who owns of these recalled vehicles needs to part it now," <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2014/03/14/6238410/hilliard-munoz-gonzales-llp-files.html">said Bob Hilliard</a> [press release], the lead attorney in the action. "Driving a recalled GM vehicle is like carrying a stick of dynamite with a slow-burning fuse." Plaintiffs are not claiming they were injured in accidents stemming for the ignition problems. GM announced the recall in February, although the company learned of the problems with the ignition switch in 2001. GM has had that when the ignition switch was jostled, a key could turn off the car's engine and disable airbags, even while traveling at high speed. There have been a reported 12 deaths and 34 crashes in the recalled cars.

<p>The defect caused GM to recall 1.6 million cars, which led government criminal and civil investigations, an internal probe by GM and preparations for hearing by Congress. GM, however, is not expected to have to pay as much as Toyota did in 2010 if it seeks to resolve economic loss claims. In 2011 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-permits-toyota-appeal-of-class-action-ruling.php">tentatively ruled</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a> [corporate website] could appeal the ruling in a class action law suit filed over alleged sudden-acceleration defects. In December 2010 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] US federal investigations by agreeing to pay a record $32.4 million in extra fines for product defects and poor handling of a recall. The fines stem from two investigations conducted by the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. The first, a fine of $16.375 million, concerned nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals entrapped by floor mats, which caused at least one fatal accident in California. The second, a fine of $16.050 million, resulted from Toyota's failure to notify the NHTSA of a safety defect in several Toyota models' steering relay rods. Toyota has been under federal scrutiny since December 2009, and has conducted several recalls. Toyota's product recalls have been analyzed by Forum guest columnist Bruce Aronson of Creighton University School of Law in the op-ed <a href="/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">Learning from Toyota's Troubles - Where's the Board?</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, one of three filed this month in attempts to overturn Indiana's ban on gay marriage, was filed on behalf of <a href="https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/midori-fujii-et-al-v-indiana-governor-et-al-plaintiff-profiles">15 plaintiffs</a> [ACLU profiles], including a widow and two children. The plaintiffs claim that they have experienced harm and discrimination as a result of the ban. Indiana does recognize same-sex civil unions, but these unions do not include some additional rights that come with marriage.

<p>Same-sex marriage is one of the most hotly debated topics in the legal community today. Just a week ago four Indiana same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/couples-challenge-indiana-ban-on-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">filed a lawsuit against the state</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana seeking to strike down the state's Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional. Earlier this month four same-sex couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit in Wyoming state court</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the state's restriction of marriage to one man and one woman. Also earlier this month a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-refuses-to-black-wisconsin-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">refused to block the state's ban</a> [JURIST report] on same-sex marriage pending the outcome of a trial. In January six same-sex couples and the Equality Florida Institute <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/same-sex-couples-sue-to-overturn-florida-marriage-ban.php">filed a lawsuit in Florida</a> [JURIST report] seeking to overturn the state's ban on same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reports indicate authorities arrested the activists for assisting the families of allegedly "disappeared" persons living in Northern Sri Lanka. In particular, the men reportedly sought to uncover information with respect to the March arrests of activist Balendran Jeyakumari and her 13-year-old daughter. Several human rights groups, including the <a href="http://www.lawandsocietytrust.org">Law and Society Trust</a> [advocacy website], have declared the arrests a <a href="http://www.lawandsocietytrust.org/PDF/Release_Ruki.doc">violation of international law</a> [press release]. Sri Lankan authorities reportedly <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sri-lankan-police-arrest-2-human-rights-activists-095202548.html">intend to detain the men</a> [AP report] pending further investigation.

<p>Sri Lanka's controversial human rights record has been criticized in the past. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sri-lanka-must-improve-human-rights-record-un-rights-chief.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka's large military presence in certain regions and lack of civil administration and economic activity, despite four years having passed since the end of the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka+civil+war">26-year civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. In May Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hrw-no-progress-in-sri-lanka-since-civil-war-ended.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that no progress has been made in Sri Lanka regarding respect for basic rights and liberties since the end of the civil war. According to HRW, the government of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes, has cracked down on media and human rights activists, and has continued to abuse suspected Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) supporters, despite Rajapaska's promise to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

The US and EU have <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/141566.pdf">called the vote illegal</a> [press release], and the EU stated that the vote's outcome would <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26606097">not be recognized</a> [AP report]. The US on Monday <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/17/crimea-parliament-declares-independence_n_4977584.html">announced sanctions</a> [AP report] against seven Russian officials while the EU's foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes against 21 officials from Russia and Ukraine. Though the government in Kiev <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26609667">refuses to recognize</a> [BBC report] the results of the vote, Moscow considers the vote legitimate. The Crimea region, which has been under the control of pro-Russia forces since late February, has appealed to other countries as well as the UN to recognize Crimean independence. As a result of the vote, Crimean officials claim Ukrainian laws no longer apply in the region, and Ukrainian state property there will be nationalized and made part of the property of the Crimean Republic.

<p>Crimea's vote for independence is the latest incident <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">escalating tensions</a> [BBC timeline] in the region. On Sunday residents in the Crimea region <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-begins-referendum-vote-to-break-away-from-ukraine.php">began voting</a> [JURIST report] in the referendum to secede from Ukraine and seek annexation by Russia. Last week Crimea's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-votes-to-become-independent-state-via-referendum.php">voted to secede</a> [JURIST report] from Ukraine and declare itself an independent state in the event of a yes vote in Sunday's poll. Protests erupted in Crimea last month decrying the recent ousting of Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovich and campaigning for annexation with Russia. Russian forces quickly moved in to control the region allegedly to protect their national interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's use of armed forces calling it a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. Last week the Crimean Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-sets-referendum-to-become-part-of-the-russian-federation.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] permission from the Russian government to join its Federation. The pro-Russian Crimean Parliament <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2014/03/11/ukraines-increasing-polarization-and-the-western-challenge/">denies</a> [Forbes report] the legitimacy of Ukraine's new pro-western government which has issued a warrant for Yanukovich's arrest for the killing of civilians during protests in Ukraine's capital of Kiev.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In February UN human rights investigators <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-north-korea-rights-violations-may-constitute-crimes-against-humanity.php">released a 372-page report</a> [JURIST report] detailing allegations of widespread crimes against humanity in North Korea that they believed merited prosecution within the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. The report included witness testimony from more than 80 victims and witnesses in South Korea, Japan, Britain and the US. The report recounted instances of government-endorsed murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortion, sexual violence, enforced disappearance and purposeful starvation, "the gravity, scale and nature" of which are allegedly without "parallel in the contemporary world." According to Kirby, the international community <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-probe-likens-north-korea-to-nazis/">must respond</a> [AFP report] to the alleged atrocities without delay. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reportedly rejected the allegations as fabricated political subterfuge. In addition China <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/us-korea-north-un-idUSBREA2G0E720140317">formally dismissed</a> [Reuters report] the UN's allegations Monday citing a lack of evidence.

<p>The UN has sought to investigate and counter alleged human rights abuses in North Korea in the past. In February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-chief-urges-action-in-north-korea.php">stated there can no longer be any excuses for inaction</a> [JURIST report] in North Korea following the release of the UN report. In September the UNHRC commission responsible for investigating potential human rights violations in North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-commission-finds-serious-violations-in-north-korea.php">reported widespread human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] occurring in the country. Last February Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman and a group of independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-un-special-rapporteur-on.php">announced their support for an international inquiry </a>[JURIST report] into human rights violations in North Korea to bring awareness to the country's system of political prison camps.

Officers say that two rolled hashish cigarettes were <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/egypt-frees-morsi-son-arrested-drugs-case-190234698.html">found in the car</a> [AP report] of the university freshman, who was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/morsis-son-face-trial-egypt-drugs-case-144221241.html">arrested</a> [AFP report] on March 1 with a friend. A urine test given to the men following the arrest tested positive, according to the prosecution. A trial date has not yet been fixed. Abdullah's brother Osama has denied the charges, saying that the case had been fabricated by the authorities to damage the name of the Morsi family.  

<p>Abdullah Morsi's father and the Muslim Brotherhood have faced a variety of investigations and criminal charges since the former president was deposed in July. In December Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/morsi-referred-to-third-trial-by-egypt-prosecutors.php">referred Mohamed Morsi to trial</a> [JURIST report] for charges of organizing a 2011 prison break, spreading chaos and abducting policemen in the country. Earlier that month, prosecutors announced that he would be charged with acts of <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Morsi-to-stand-trial-for-espionage.php">espionage and terrorism</a> [JURIST report].

The charitable organizations <a href="http://www.howardleague.org/judicial-review-legal-aid/">challenged the legal aid cuts</a> [Howard League press release], which were enacted in December, on the grounds that it would undermine prisoners' rights and rehabilitation and that taxpayers would ultimately pay more as a result. The High Court <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26609536">ruled</a> [BBC report] that while concerns over the cuts are understandable, those concerns do not constitute unlawful action. The court further noted that the organizations should advance their concerns through a political, rather than legal, forum. Both <a href="http://www.howardleague.org/legal_aid_appeal/">Howard League</a> and the <a href="http://prisonersadvice.org.uk/news/">PAS</a> [press releases] have indicated their intent to appeal the ruling.

<p>Lawyers and legal organizations in the UK have responded critically to the cuts to legal aid in the UK. In January thousands of criminal trial lawyers in the UK <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uk-trial-lawyers-stage-strike-over-fee-cuts.php">staged a half-day strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest planned government cuts to legal aid that would reduce their pay by up to 30 percent. In June the UK Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent public body that investigates miscarriages of justice, warned that the government's proposed changes to legal aid could increase the likelihood of convictions of vulnerable or mentally ill suspects. Earlier that month the <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/law-society-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">Law Society</a> [press release] described the proposals as "unworkable" and likely to cause "catastrophic" damage to the UK's legal aid system. Also in June, the Bar Council released a <a href="http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media-centre/news-and-press-releases/2013/june/bar-council-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">press release</a> [text] criticizing the proposals. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Greenpeace is <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/seeking-justice-for-the-arctic-30/blog/48541/">requesting</a> [press release] "just compensation" for the Arctic 30 as well as a declaration by the court that Russia's apprehension and detention of the activists in international waters was unlawful. Greenpeace <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304747404579445133387263624?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304747404579445133387263624.html">asserts</a> [WSJ report] that the court has jurisdiction to rule on the case because Russia has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights.

<p>In December Greenpeace <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/Russia-drops-first-case-against-Greenpeace-activists.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against the Arctic 30. In November a Russian court granted bail to Colin Russell, who was one of the activists detained. That same month, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/international-tribunal-orders-russia-to-release-greenpeace-activists.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of the Arctic Sunrise as well as all those arrested in board the ship, upon payment of a 3.6 million euro bond by the Netherlands. In October the activists were <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/netherlands-files-suit-against-russia-for-releas-of-greenpeace-activists.php">charged with piracy</a> following their staged protest. Russia's treatment of the activists has drawn criticism from a number of rights groups including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/10/04/russia-withdraw-charges-against-protester">Human Rights Watch</a> [press release].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website] announced on Saturday that it will <a href="http://www.aps.dz/en/folder-presidential-election-2014/1570-presidential-election-2014-au-to-send-200-observers">send 200 observers</a> [APS report] to Algeria to ensure transparency in the electoral process. The <a href="http://www.lasportal.org/wps/portal/las_ar/home_page/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gXy8CgMJMgYwODEH8zA08jD5cgP0M_YwsvY6B8JB55QwK6gxOL9MNBduI3AyRvgAM4Guj7eeTnpuoX5EZUeOo6KgIA1RJ3BA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic] will also be <a href="http://www.aps.dz/en/folder-presidential-election-2014/1569-arab-league-for-transparent-election-in-algeria">sending observers</a> [APS report]. Algeria will hold its elections on April 17.

<p>During Algeria's 2012 elections, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Assembly and Peaceful Assembly and Association urged Algeria to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-expert-algeria-should-use-elections-to-improve-assembly-and-association-laws.php">use its upcoming legislative elections to address concerns</a> [JURIST report] about inadequate freedoms of expression and association. In December 2011 Algeria passed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/algeria-lawmakers-approve-controversial-media-law.php">controversial media law</a> [JURIST report] preventing journalists from undermining the Algerian government and its policies and security. Earlier that year a UN rights expert called on Algeria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-expert-urges-algeria-to-guarantee-freedom-of-expression.php">guarantee freedoms</a> [JURIST report] of opinion and expression to its people. This came a week after Bouteflika <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/algeria-president-announces-constitutional-reforms-amid-political-protests.php">promised to reform</a> [JURIST report] the country's constitution and change its election laws to appease political protesters.

De Albuquerque did note that in spite of the fact that Jordan is one of the most water-stressed nations in the world, 98 percent of Jordanian households are now connected to the water network and 68 percent are connected to the sewage network. However, she <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14387&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Jordan to adopt a more sustainable stance to ensure the provision of water and sanitation to the wider Jordanian population and to the numerous refugees that have fled to Jordan.

The resolution passed by a vote of 122-0. One of the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> [official website] to reduce social and economic harms by 2015 includes decreasing the number of people who cannot reach or afford safe drinking water and do not have basic sanitation by half. The resolution expressed concern that approximately 884 million people are without access to safe drinking water and more than 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. In March of that year, Bolivian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3203752.stm">President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bolivia-president-urges-un-to-declare.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to declare access to safe drinking water a basic human right and introduced the resolution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The media conglomerate Viacom is known for its television networks including Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and VH1. In the original suit, Viacom sought $1 billion in damages as well as an injunction against Google's YouTube service for allowing clips to be posted on the website without authorization. The lawsuit <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-google-viacom-lawsuit-idUSBREA2H11220140318">drew widespread attention</a> [Reuters report] because of the growing popularity of free video sharing sites, such as YouTube, and the difficulty of monitoring the distribution of copyrighted material on the Internet. The financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Viacom and Google <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303563304579446980859743564?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303563304579446980859743564.html">released</a> [WSJ report] a joint statement on Tuesday announcing the settlement: "This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together." The announcement comes six days before oral arguments were scheduled before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit next Monday. 

<p><span class="casename">Viacom International Inc et al v. YouTube Inc et al</span> was one of the most closely watched intellectual property cases in the modern era. Last April 2013 a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-dismisses-viacom-copyright-suit-against-youtube.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the suit holding Google was not liable for copyright infringement because general knowledge of copyright violations were protected by the "safe harbor" provision of the 1998 federal <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA) [text, PDF], which created limitations on the liability of online service providers for copyright infringement when engaging in certain types of activities. In April 2012 the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-viacom-copyright-infringement-case-against-youtube.php">reinstated and remanded</a> the lawsuit against Google, after the suit was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/federal-judge-dismisses-viacom-copyright-case-against-googles-youtube.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York two years earlier. Following the 2012 Court of Appeals decision, JURIST Guest Columnist Olivier Sylvain of the Fordham University School of Law <a href="/forum/2012/05/olivier-sylvain-viacom-dmca.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] the holding represents a growing convergence of opinion in how to interpret the DMCA, which could ultimately be a good development for all parties involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law purportedly <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/400496/myanmar-enacts-first-media-law">assures</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] local media freedom from state <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12991727">censorship</a>  [BBC backgrounder] and attempts to promote high-quality journalistic practices by emphasizing ethics and responsibility. However, the law granting new freedoms is accompanied by another law passed the same day that governs publishing licenses. Some critics have expressed <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burmas-parliament-approves-parallel-media-laws.html">concern</a> [Irrawaddy report] that any gains contained within the "Press Law" will be overshadowed by the publishing law, as it gives complete discretion to the Ministry of Information (MOI) to withhold or rescind publishing licenses, leaving the government with substantial control over what media is disseminated and by whom. However, while not considered a sweeping reform, the new law does provide real protections to journalists, such as protecting them from imprisonment, providing a legal avenue to challenge denials of publication licenses by the MOI in the courts, and can seek judicial relief if they are forced from their jobs. The new law also creates a new oversight body, the Independent Press Council, made up of between 15 and 30 members, three of which are to be appointed by the president. The Council will oversee media organizations to promote good journalistic practices and to help journalists deal with legal issues relating to the their work, including adjudicating allegations of ethical violations internally rather than turning such cases over to law enforcement.

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16546688">Reform</a> [BBC timeline] in Myanmar has taken place slowly in the last three years since the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">dissolution</a> [BBC report] of the nation's military government and transition to a civilian regime in 2011. Last April the EU <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22254493">removed</a> [JURIST report] the last of its economic and trade sanctions imposed on Myanmar in response to positive changes and political reforms. Also in that month the government began allowing the publication of privately owned newspapers in the country, for the first time in 50 years. In January of last year the government lifted its 25-year ban on public gatherings of more than five people. In 2012 pre-publication censorship practices were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12991727">abolished</a>, [BBC backgrounder] and has been scaling back its censorship of online content, removing access restrictions to international news websites, Youtube, and websites containing political content. Starting in 2011 the government began scaling back media controls, restrictions that had been in place since the 1962 military coup that established the military government. Under that administration nearly all forms of media were censored and monitored for criticism of the government, not only news and political sources but cultural media as well such as film and literature. However, even with current reforms much of the available media within the country is still controlled by the state, since it owns most of the reporting and broadcasting outlets. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report describes horrific violence in Syria by rebel and government forces in recent months. Most striking is the depiction of "execution fields" where mass killings were reportedly committed by jihadist rebels against Syrian civilians and the use of barrel bomb attacks by government forces into residential neighborhoods of Aleppo city. The report covers war violations committed during the period of January 20 until March 10, 2014, and it is based on 130 interviews conducted around the region and in Geneva as well as satellite images, photographs, video recordings and other materials. Further investigations into allegations of massacres are ongoing.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has persisted for more than three years and the conflict is known for severe human rights violations. According to Tuesday's UN report, the number of recorded casualties is now in excess of one hundred thousand. Earlier this month, the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/international-community-must-respond-to-syria-crisis-un.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to respond to the recurring crimes against humanity perpetrated by both government and non-government entities.

In February UN human rights experts reported that pro-Government and opposition forces are <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/both-sides-committing-war-crimes-in-syria-un-rights-experts.php">both responsible</a> for committing war crimes in Syria, including human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-report-highlights-abuse-of-children-in-syria.php">violations against children</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

At the time, the Interior Ministry had <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/egypt-police-sentence-idINDEEA2H07Z20140318">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that the men were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to escape from prison. Three of the men were given one-year suspended sentences, but the formerDeputy Chief of the Heliopolis police station, Lt. Col. Amr Farouk was given a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26626367">10-year sentence with labor</a> [BBC report]. The victims' families and their lawyers reportedly <a href="http://www.startribune.com/world/250756841.html">expressed</a> [AP report] dissatisfaction with the outcome, stating that the sentences were too light and that the offenders should have been tried for murder. The detainees were supporters of ousted Egyptian president Mohammed Morsi, and the incident took place shortly after violent breakups by Egyptian troops of protests decrying his removal by the military last year. Many of the detainees who died were members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was recently declared a terrorist organization by the new Egyptian government, prompting criticisms that the relatively light sentences are a reflection of the government's attitude towards the group and its members.

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Much of that conflict has recently occurred between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Muhammed Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">ouster</a> in July 2013, especially since the organization's formal <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. On March 4 a Cairo court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-brands-hamas-a-terrorist-group.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to be a terrorist organization and banned its activities in Egypt, based on its connection to the Muslim Brotherhood. In February Egypt's Prosecutor General <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-refers-muslim-brotherhood-members-for-mass-criminal-tribunal.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] 504 members of the Muslim Brotherhood for a mass trial alleging a plethora of various crimes committed in relation to the August 16 "<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013816121757821877.html">Day of Rage</a>" [Al Jazeera report]. In January, 113 supporters and members of the Muslim Brotherhood were <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-court-convicts-113-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-in-three-trials.php">convicted</a> of various crimes, following the <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/egypt-court-sentences-139-protesters-in-mass-trial.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] of 139 pro-Morsi supporters in December. Also in that month Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-urges-egyptian-government-to-remove-designation-of-muslim-brotherhood-as-terrorist-organization.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to reconsider and reverse its branding of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Ocalan, imprisoned on the Turkish island of Imarli since 1999, had been subjected to "inhuman" conditions from the time of his incarceration until November 2009. The court also ruled that Ocalan's life sentence (commuted from a death sentence in 2002 when Turkey abolished capital punishment) should not have been imposed "without any possibility of conditional release." Ocalan lodged his grievances with the ECHR in August 2003 asserting the Turkish government violated several articles of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] in regard to his prison conditions and his sentence. Specifically, Ocalan, complained that he was kept socially isolated, that his life sentence without possibility of release was too harsh and that he was gradually being poisoned in prison. The court found the Turkish government violated only Article three of the convention, which prohibits "inhuman or degrading treatment" by keeping Ocalan isolated from his family, attorneys and other prisoners and terming his life sentence as "irreducible." The court ordered Turkey to pay Ocalan "25,000 euros in respect of costs and expenses."

<p>The PKK, deemed an illegal terrorist organization by the Turkish government, advocates for secession of part of Turkey's territory to become an independent Kurdish state within Turkey. Ocalan, arrested for "leading a gang of armed terrorists responsible for attacks resulting in the death of thousands of people," has been complaining of unfair judicial treatment and campaigning for the legitimacy of the PKK since his incarceration. In 2003 Ocalan successfully <a href="/paperchase/2003/03/ocalan-trial-unfair-echr.php">sued</a> for a new trial, <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/ocalan-trial-found-unfair-by-european.php">claiming</a> [JURIST reports] that his trial proceedings were delayed and that he had not been tried before an independent and impartial tribunal. In 2007 Ocalan <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/europe-court-allows-pkk-appeal-against.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a 2002 decision of the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu">Council of the European Union</a> [official website] to include the PKK on its list of terrorist organizations. In 2012 hundreds of Kurdish political prisoners went on a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100">hunger strike</a> [BBC backgrounder] demanding better conditions for Ocalan. Ocalan, in a display of his continued influence in the Kurdish movement, successfully pleaded for an end to the 68 day political fast.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Individuals who have regularly been detained include Syrian refugees and women who have forcibly been separated from their young children. Research gathered recently during visits to the country show that authorities have been breaching EU and international laws by failing to implement safeguards that allow detention only as a final resort. Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights at AI, stated, "Amnesty International is concerned that Cyprus is using the systematic detention of migrants to intimidate and deter potential immigrants and asylum-seekers." Some of those detained had even resided in Cyprus for years prior to their detainment. AI stated that detention within Cyprus must cease as a common practice, and that it should only be used after being proven necessary, and after less restrictive options are exhausted.

<p>Migration practices by a number of countries have been determined to violate international law in recent years. In October UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/--.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to take action after a second migrant ship capsized near the Italian island of Lampedusa a week earlier, during an attempt to cross from Africa to Europe. Ban emphasized the need to adopt new approaches to migration, focusing on the vulnerability and human rights of migrants. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/un-rights-chief-urges-human-rights-based-migration-policies.php">called on governments</a> [JURIST report] to create human rights-based policies addressing migration. In May Crepeau visited both sides of the border in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.2_EN.pdf">Turkey</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.4_en.pdf">Greece</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add1_en.pdf">Tunisia</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add3_en.pdf">Italy</a> [official reports; PDF] to investigate the migration experience. He found that those irregular migrants related to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arab+spring">Arab Spring</a> [JURIST news archive] and global south were unduly targeted for security purposes that were ineffective and indirectly exploitative. Irregular migrants are those seeking economic opportunities that do not enter through a traditional visa program, usually because a sufficient program is not offered by the EU to support the seasonal work force required by its member states' economies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This affirms the court's 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/germany-constitutional-court-supports-caps-eurozone-funding.php">decision</a> [JURIST report], which rejected a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the ESM and the fiscal compact, but which imposed a cap on Germany's contribution to the fund. The court stated that safeguards were put in place to ensure the cap remained at 190 billion euros, with any increase being <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/uk-germany-eurozone-court-idUKBREA2H00W20140318">subject to a vote</a> [Reuters report] by the <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/index.jsp">Bundestag</a> [official website, in German]. The court also reiterated that the ESM did not violate the rights of the Bundestag to decide budgetary matters if the Bundestag is able to maintain sufficient power of oversight over the ESM. Despite the court's original 2012 ruling and Tuesday's affirmation, critics who want the ESM and fiscal compact to be subject to a referendum continue to argue that the measures are unconstitutional.

<p>In July of 2012 the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-top-court-to-hear-claims-against-fiscal-pacts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] over a claim brought in opposition to the ESM. Earlier, in June the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the German Bundestag has the right to be heard on the European financial crisis, holding in a case initiated by the Green party that Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to notify the parliament early enough about plans for the ESM regarding its sister party in Austria. Although that decision did not have any effect on the 500 billion euro ESM, it increased the parliament's rights by requiring the chancellor's government to provide notice to the parliament as early as possible in the future. A previous ruling that gave the parliament similar rights over matters concerning the EU was issued in February. The country's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/germany-high-court-rules-europe-stimulus-procedure-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the use of a parliamentary subcommittee to fast-track decisions related to eurozone bailouts is unconstitutional, instead requiring the entire Bundestag to overview such decisions. In September of 2011 the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/germany-high-court-rejects-challenges-to-european-stimulus.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the parliament did not unconstitutionally impair its own ability to adopt and control the nation's budget, nor did it infringe on the budget autonomy of future parliaments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a second corruption allegation, Zia, her son <a href="http://www.tariquerahman.net/">Tarique Rahman</a> [official website], the Senior Vice-Chairperson of the BNP, and three others are accused of embezzling funds from an orphanage named after Zia's late husband. Both Zia and her son were <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bangladesh-ex-pm-and-opposition-leader-charged-with-corruption.php">previously indicted</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges in 2011 when the <a href="http://www.lcgbangladesh.org/corruption/docs/ACC_Act_Annotated.pdf">Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (ACC) [governing statute] accused the pair of taking USD $1.05 million in donations from a charity also named after Zia's late husband. Zia has alleged that the indictments are politically motivated. The court in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka has set April 21 as the start date for the trial. 

<p>The political situation in Bangladesh has been tense in recent months following BNP's boycott of January elections that were <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/5/bangladesh-electionviolence.html">marked</a> [Al Jazeera report] by considerable violence and returned Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?Itemid=142&id=76&option=com_content&task=view">Sheikh Hasina</a> [official website] to power.

After a <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/france-court-opens-countrys-first-rwanda-genocide-trial.php">six-week trial</a>, in which Simbikangwa maintained his innocence, the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/france-court-delivers-first-ever-rwanda-genocide-conviction.php">delivered a sentence</a> [JURIST reports] of 25 years in prison last week. Simbikangwa was charged with arming and directing Hutu extremists in the violence that claimed the lives of an estimated half a million ethnic Tutsi. He was arrested in 2008 while in hiding on the French island of Mayotte. The current president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, has accused France of supporting the Hutu militia and harboring fugitives who fled to France in the years following the genocide. This trial is seen as an important first step in repairing relations between the nations. An official date for the appeal hearing has yet to be determined, but reports indicate that the court does not expect to hear the appeal until 2015.

<p>France has only recently joined the US and other European nations in trying and extraditing individuals accused of having aided or been complicit in the Rwandan genocide. A French appeals court in November <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php">agreed to extradite</a> [JURIST report] two genocide suspects, one of whom had been a French citizen since 2010. In September a French court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/france-court-rejects-request-to-extradite-former-rwanda-colonel.php">refused to extradite</a> [JURIST report] an Hutu ex-colonel, citing the statute of limitations preventing extradition for crimes committed more than 10 years ago. In April French law enforcement <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a former Rwanda leader in the same week that Simbikangwa was ordered to stand trial. Rwandan genocide suspects have also been arrested in 2013 in <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/new-hampshire-woman-sentenced-to-10-years-for-role-in-rwandan-genocide.php">New Hampshire</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/dutch-court-convicts-woman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda.php">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">Norway</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Interior Ministry <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/609190">arrested the men</a> [BNA report] after searching their farmhouse pursuant to a warrant issued by the Public Prosecution office. Authorities uncovered five illegally smuggled AK-47 rifles with silencers, 3500 rounds of ammunition, five silenced handguns and a variety of explosives and bomb-making materials. Several of the accused reportedly pleaded guilty to the charges, while the others faced further investigation and examination in court. Reports indicate that the men <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/bahrain-jails-11-bomb-makers-15-years-071535035.html">planned to attack</a> [AFP report] members of Bahrain's security forces and various high-level public figures within the Sunni-ruled kingdom.

<p>Sunni-ruled Bahrain continues to battle public protest and violence from clashes with the Shiite minority. In November Bahraini authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/bahrain-authorities-arrest-2-former-guantanamo-detainees.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] two former Guantanamo Bay detainees for plotting an attack in Bahrain.

The petition brought by the families of the deceased <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26640527">allege</a> [BBC report] that British troops "massacred" the workers during the campaign against communist rebels known as the <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R957.html">Malayan Emergency</a> [RAND backgrounder]. The bid before the Appeals Court follows a <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building">High Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/keyu-sec-state-foreign-commonwealth-affairs-judgment-04092012.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] in 2012, which found that there was no dispute that 24 people were killed at Batang Kali by British Troops but, that it would "be very difficult at this point in time to establish definitively whether the men were shot trying to escape or whether these were deliberate executions." Two inquiries into the killings have already taken place, once in 1948 shortly following the event and again in 1970. The lawyer for the appellants has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/malaysian-shooting-relatives-lose-uk-court-battle/2014/03/19/ae75aaba-af5a-11e3-b8b3-44b1d1cd4c1f_story.html">stated</a> [WP report] that the case will be brought to Britain's Supreme Court.

<p>In September 2012 the High Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/uk-court-rejects-inquiry-into-killing-of-malaysia-rubber-plantation-workers.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a petition calling for an independent investigation into the incident. The British government had explained the previous November that they would not be conducting an investigation into the shootings, but the families of the Malaysian plantation workers maintained that there was sufficient evidence to launch an independent inquiry. The lawyers representing the victims' families vowed to appeal the High Court ruling, claiming that statements made by British soldiers prove that the killings were unlawful. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Cao was an influential human rights lawyer and activist in China who "tirelessly campaigned since 2008 for transparency and greater participation of civil society" in the second <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/upr/pages/uprmain.aspx">universal periodic review</a> [materials] of China's human rights record. On September 14, Cao was detained by Chinese officials before boarding a flight from Beijing to Geneva where she was take part in a human rights seminar and observe China's universal periodic review by the Council. Cao's whereabouts became unknown for some time, until she was later charged with the crime of provocation. This disappearance and criminal charge, coupled with the fact that she was being denied medical treatment despite her deteriorating health, led UN experts to send urgent appeals to China. In a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13860&LangID=E">public statement</a> [press release], experts stated "accurate information on the detention of any person, including the reasons and place of detention, shall be made promptly available to their family members and their counsel." Due to her failing health while in detention, Cao was later transferred to a hospital in critical condition on February 19, and died less than a month later on March 14.

<p>Human rights have been a controversial issue in China in recent years, along with accusations of corruption within the Chinese government. In December Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-urges-china-to-drop-charges-against-rights-activist.php">urged the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] to drop all politically motivated charges against human rights activist Xu Zhiyong and release him from prison. In August Chinese writer, lawyer and human rights advocate Yang Maodong became the second leader of the New Citizens movement to be <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/china-authorities-detain-human-rights-advocate.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report], following Xu, on suspicion of disrupting the peace. In June a Chinese court in Huairou <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/brother-in-law-of-china-rights-activist-sentenced-to-11-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Liu Hui, brother-in-law  of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, to 11 years in prison on charges of fraud. In May China's Nanjing Intermediate People's Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/former-chinese-official-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-accepting-bribes.php">issued a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] to Huang Sheng, the former provincial deputy governor of Shandong Province, for accepting almost $2 million in bribes form 21 organizations and numerous individuals between 1998 and 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French] upheld two lower court verdicts that determined that Kerviel acted without the bank's knowledge in building up positions of around &#8364;50 billion that brought the bank to the brink of collapse in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis. However, the Court overruled the &#8364;4.9 billion (USD $6.82 billion) in civil damages Kerviel was meant to pay SocGen to compensate for the bank's losses. A new civil trial will take place to decide on the eventual damages. The large fine essentially meant that SocGen could have had a lifetime claim on Kerviel's income, and was met with an outcry from the public and politicians who believed it excessive. Kerviel, who has spent three years trying to overturn his conviction, does not deny masking the 50 billion euro positions but accuses SocGen of knowing what he was doing.

<p>Kerviel was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-court-sentences-rogue-trader-to-3-years-in-prison-for-bank-fraud.php">originally convicted in 2010</a> [JURIST report], and was retried in 2012.

He was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/france-court-orders-release-of-rogue.php">released in March 2008</a> [JURIST report] but instructed not to leave the country or communicate with a number of former colleagues.

Prior to the high court's confirmation, Berlusconi had hoped to run for European Parliament in May. Berlusconi had fought to overturn the ban handed down by a Milan appeals court last October. Berlusconi was also sentenced to four years in prison, later commuted to one year, after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/italy-supreme-court-upholds-jail-sentence-for-berlusconi.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last August of tax evasion by his holding company <a href="http://www.fininvest.it/">Fininvest</a> [corporate website]. Berlusconi plans to further appeal the tax fraud verdict to Italy's constitutional court. 

<p>Last November the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/Italy-senate-expels-former-pm-Berlusconi.php">voted to expel</a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi from parliament following his conviction for tax fraud, which stripped the former primer of his immunity allowing him to face prosecution for other crimes. Berlusconi has since <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/italian-senate-committee-recommends-expulsion-for-berlusconi-a-926179.html">appealed his expulsion</a> [Spiegel report] to the European Court of Human Rights. In October a senate panel <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/italy-court-bans-berlusconi-from-running-for-office-for-two-years.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of expelling Berlusconi from his seat in parliament. Also in October, an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/italy-court-bans-berlusconi-from-running-for-office-for-two-years.php">prohibited Berlusconi from running for office for two years</a> [JURIST report] due to his tax fraud conviction. In addition to the fraud charges, Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, has faced a number of criminal charges including <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports].

The plaintiffs <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/19/google-gmail-lawsuit-idUSL2N0MG0OJ20140319">allege</a> [Reuters report] that Google violated state and federal privacy and wiretapping laws by reviewing messages in order to conduct target advertising. Koh <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-google-gmail-lawsuit-20140319,0,1206216.story">determined</a> [Reuters report] that the claims were too dissimilar to be consolidated into a single suit and that the plaintiffs are foreclosed from pursuing further class action suits. Koh's decision is considered a win for Google, which could have faced billions in damages had the class action suit been permitted. Google is also in the midst of litigation in California over allegedly violating federal wiretapping law by collecting data while building its Street View maps. 

<p>Google has come under scrutiny in recent months for its privacy policies and it is currently litigating throughout the world for alleged violations. In February a French court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/france-court-rules-google-must-comply-with-publication-notice.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google must display on its french page that they have been fined by the local data-protection watchdog for how they store user information. Also in February the <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/">UK High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uk-high-court-google-can-be-sued-in-the-uk.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google can be sued by British citizens. In November the Dutch <a href="http://www.dutchdpa.nl/Pages/home.aspx">Data Protection Agency</a> (DPA) [official website] stated that Google was in <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/netherlands-say-google-violates-data-protection-laws.php">violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's data protection act. Earlier that month the Regional Court of Berlin held that 25 of Google's privacy policies and terms of service <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/germany-court-rules-google-violated-german-data-protection-law.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] Germany's data protection law. In September, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-googles-motion-to-dismiss-street-view-privacy-case.php">denied Google's motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit regarding the company's alleged violation of federal law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/0319_toyota2.pdf">criminal complaint</a> [text, PDF] against Toyota alleges that the company intentionally concealed information from the public regarding a design defect whereby drivers attempting to break actually accelerated their vehicles. The settlement will allow Toyota to avoid criminal prosecution after three years and marks the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/19/justice-department-and-toyota-agree-to-1-2-billion-settlement-of-safety-probe/">largest penalty of its kind</a> [WSJ report] ever imposed on a car company. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric</a> [official website] holder held a press conference on the settlement where he called Toyota's conduct "shameful" and accused the company of confronting "a public safety emergency as if it were simply a public relations problem."

<p>Wednesday's settlement is the latest development in the litigation surrounding Toyota's handling of the 2010 recall. In November 2012 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/toyota-settles-shareholder-class-action-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit for 35.5 million dollars brought by its shareholders failing to disclose vehicle quality issues. In 2010, Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay 32.4 million in fines in following investigations by the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. JURIST Guest Columnist Bruce Aronson <a href="/forum/2011/11/bruce-aronson-corporate-governanace.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the recent corporate scandals in Japan, including the Toyota recalls, highlight the need for reform of that country's corporate governance structure. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The state's assistant attorney general <a href="http://time.com/29345/oklahoma-lethal-injection-drugs/">submitted a brief</a> [TIME report] to the court on Monday, which reported that Oklahoma does not currently have the necessary pentobarbital or vecuronium bromide. Both of these drugs, in conjunction with potassium chloride, are necessary in order to carry out a lawful death sentence in the state. Execution dates for the inmates are now rescheduled for April 22 and April 29.

<p>The shortage of commonly used lethal injection drugs in the US is severe, forcing a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols. In February the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/georgia-supreme-court-to-rule-on-challenge-to-execution-drug-secrecy-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to withhold the identities of the manufacturers of Georgia's lethal injection drugs. Earlier that month, a federal judge in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-delays-louisiana-execution-to-review-injection-drugs.php">scheduled</a> [JURIST report] a trial to review the constitutionality of the state's new execution protocol, which delayed the prisoner's execution for 90 days. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-orders-stay-of-execution-for-missouri-death-row-inmate.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Missouri death row inmate because the state refused to release the name of the pharmaceutical to be used in the execution, but the stay was later lifted and the execution carried out. This same two-drug mixture at question in Louisiana was used last month in the execution of an Ohio convict, which reportedly caused him to suffer visible pain and his children have <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-inmates-family-files-lawsuit-over-prolonged-execution.php">filed a suit</a> in federal court over the <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/ohio-execution-demonstrates-controversial-new-injection.php">prolonged execution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://ecf.ksd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv4095-157">ordered</a> [PDF] the US <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) [official website] to assist Kansas and Arizona in enforcing their proof of citizenship laws for new voters by adding language requested by both states to the state-specific instructions on the federal mail voter registration form. Judge Eric Melgren stated in the court's ruling that Congress did not preempt state proof of citizenship laws with the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/workflow_staging/Page/27.PDF">National Voter Registration Act</a> [PDF], and therefore found "the decision of the EAC denying the states' requests to be unlawful and in excess of its statutory authority." The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] has ruled that laws requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections are unconstitutional, but it has preserved the states' rights to control who will vote in state and local elections. Kansas has set up a two-tiered voter registration system, which requires voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote in local and state elections. Arizona has also adopted a similar two-tiered voter registration system in response to the Supreme Court's ruling. Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, <a href="https://www.sos.ks.gov/other/news_releases/PR_2014/NR_2014-03-19_Kansas_Wins_Lawsuit_Against_EAC.pdf">stated</a> [press release] regarding the decision, "Because of this victory there will be no need for a dual election system. Otherwise we would have been stuck with a federal-elections-only ballot for those very few who used the federal form to register and failed to provide a citizenship document." Melgren ordered the EAC to immediately add the language requested by Arizona and Kansas to the state-specific instructions of the federal mail voter registration.

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-kansas-voter-registration-system.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November in Shawnee County District Court, challenging Kansas' two-tiered voter registration system. Kansas <a href="https://www.sos.ks.gov/">Secretary of State Kris Kobach</a> and Arizona <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/">Secretary of State Ken Bennett</a> [official profiles] also filed an earlier complaint in August in the US District Court for the District of Kansas, demanding that the EAC modify federal voter registration forms to allow states to require proof of citizenship. The two-tier system in question allows voters who use the National registration form, which does not require proof of citizenship, to vote only in national elections. Voters must use the Kansas voter registration form in order to be eligible to also vote in local and state elections. Kobach lists "Stopping Voter Fraud" as the <a href="http://www.kriskobach.org/index-4.html">number one issue on his platform</a> [personal website] on his political website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Portillo <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-guatemala-portillo-idUSBREA2H1QD20140318">read a statement</a> [Reuters report] before the court admitting to taking the bribes as part of a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. As part of the plea deal Portillo will face 46 to 71 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines with sentencing scheduled for June 23. Portillo was extradited to the US last May after the <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Guatemala Constitutional Court</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/guatemala-ex-president-to-be-extradited-to-us-for-embezzlement-trial.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of his extradition. The $2.5 million Portillo received from Taiwan is only a small fraction of the tens of millions of dollars U.S. prosecutors have alleged Portillo embezzled from the Guatemalan government and laundered through US banks.

<p>The legal saga of former president Portillo has been ongoing for more than five years. Portillo had <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/guatemala-ex-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-money-laundering-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to money laundering charges in the District Court in May. He <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/May13/PortilloAlfonsoExtraditionPR/U.S.%20v.%20Alfonso%20Portillo%20Indictment.pdf">was charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with having laundered more than $70 million through US banks during his four years as president. In 2011 the criminal <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/guatemala-ex-president-begins-embezzlement-trial.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report] against Portillo were thrown out by the lower Guatemalan court, which found that prosecutors had failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that Portillo was personally involved in the embezzlement of Guatemala's <a href="http://www.mindef.mil.gt/">Ministry of Defense</a> [official website, in Spanish] funds. Portillo <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8481914.stm">was arrested</a> [BBC report] in January 2011 following an <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/jmb-us-requests-extradition-of-former.php">arrest warrant issued by Guatemala</a> [JURIST report] based on the US indictment. In 2008, Portillo <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/mexico-extradites-former-guatemala.php">was extradited</a> [JURIST report] back to Guatemala from Mexico, where he had fled after his immunity expired along with his term in office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court overturned the conviction of William Melchert-Dinkel, who was convicted in 2011 of two counts of aiding suicide, after a judge found he "intentionally advised and encouraged" two individuals, one in Canada and one England, to commit suicide. The court found that the terms "advises" and "encourages" within <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=609.215">Minn. Stat. &#167; 609.215</a> [text] which makes it illegal to "intentionally advise, encourage, or assist another in taking the other's own life," were unconstitutional in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text, LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">backgrounder</a>]. The court upheld the "assist" portion of the law concluding "that the proscription against 'assist[ing]' another in taking the other's own life is narrowly drawn to serve the State's compelling interest in preserving human life." The court's decision severs the words "advises" and "encourages" from the statute but maintains the prohibition against assisting suicide. The court remanded Melchert-Dinkel case to the lower district court because the district court made no findings regarding whether appellant assisted the victims' suicides within the newly severed statute. 

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue in the US and around the world. In October the <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/?page=551">Minnesota Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/minnesota-court-strikes-down-law-against-advising-suicide.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the same state law ruled on by the Minnesota Supreme Court Wednesday criminalizing speech that "advises" and "encourages" another's suicide was unconstitutional. The suit was filed against the national right-to-die group <a href="http://www.finalexitnetwork.org/">Final Exit Network</a> [advocacy website] after they were charged with the 2007 suicide of a Minnesota woman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In February Shinawatra was <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-pm-charged-with-corruption-for-rice-subsidy-program.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with neglect of duty relating to the management of the country's rice subsidy program. This announcement came mere hours after a police officer and three civilians were killed and 64 others injured in clashes in Bangkok's historical district. On February 12 the Thai Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects-bid-to-annul-election.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] petitions filed by the opposition Democrat Party to annul the January elections on the grounds that they were held unconstitutionally because they were not completed in a single day. The petition also <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-opposition-party-petitions-court-to-annul-election.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the dissolution of the ruling party and a ban on party executives from holding public office for a period of five years. On January 26 the opposition protest leader Suthin Thararin was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">shot</a> [JURIST report] to death in Bangkok during a protest blocking a voting station, just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency in response to the protests and violence.

This is the second time that the court has looked at the case. The law allows police to collect a DNA sample from any adult arrested for or charged with a felony and to keep the sample in a database indefinitely. Under the law, the DNA may be collected whether or not charges are ever actually pressed. The <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/">ACLU of Northern California</a> [advocacy website] filed the federal class-action lawsuit, <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/our-work/legal-docket/haskell-v-harris">Haskell v. Harris</a> [ACLU backgrounder], on behalf of Lily Haskell and three other plaintiffs who were forced to turn over a cheek swab of their genetic blueprint to police. In its ruling, the court, sitting  <em>en banc</em>, stated that because the plaintiffs conceded that the law is constitutional as applied to anyone arrested for a felony offense, plaintiffs are unable to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying a preliminary injunction that would apply to the entire class. The panel suggested that plaintiffs could bring a case with a smaller class, "consisting of individuals arrested for certain felonies that are not, in plaintiffs' view, covered by [the US Supreme Court's decision in] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf">Maryland v. King</a> [opinion, PDF]." The panel disagreed with the plaintiffs that the California law could be distinguished from the law in <span class="casename">Maryland v. King</span>. In spite the unfavorable ruling, the ACLU plans to continue the lawsuit with a narrower group of particular groups of people arrested for felonies.

<p>Collection of DNA from arrestees is controversial throughout the US, and courts have been split on the issue. The <em>en banc</em> court heard oral arguments in <span class="casename">Haskell v. Harris</span> in December of last year. In June the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-upholds-maryland-warrantless-dna-collection.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/maryland-v-king/">Maryland v. King</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that police may collect DNA samples from individuals arrested and charged with serious crimes. The respondent in the case, Alonzo King, challenged the validity of Maryland's <a href="http://www.goccp.maryland.gov/dna/documents/legislation.pdf">DNA Collection Act</a> [text, PDF] after state officials used his DNA to implicate him in a later crime. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the majority found that the warrantless DNA collection does not violate arrestees' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. Some legal commentators <a href="/sidebar/2013/07/sammons-hu-routine-booking-procedure.php">argue</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the US Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">Maryland v. King</span> correctly furthered the state's interest in solving crimes through the use of DNA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Expressing the urgent need to restore law in order in the country, Pillay called the situation "dire." Pillay <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47388&Cr=central+african+republic&Cr1=#.UytVB61dWmS">spoke of the challenges</a> [press release] that the judicial system is facing, including lack of resources to pay staff, threats to prosecutors and deficiencies in physical structures to detain people apprehended. Moreover, the collapse of the economy has exacerbated efforts at restructuring the penal system. Pillay stated that she sent three different monitoring teams to CAR to document the human rights violations that have been taking place in an effort to assist the recently created Commission of Inquiry on CAR. Pillay was able to report that positive developments include: the Transitional Parliament's discussions on the right to life, the creation of a Reconciliation Commission and a Permanent Commission on Dialogue, and the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission. She closed her statement by expressing her deep concern at the slow response from the international community.

<p>International concern continues to grow in the wake of reports of gross human rights violations in CAR since the Seleka rebel forces seized the nations capital last March. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] established an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47314&Cr=central+african+republic&Cr1=#.Ux4E5j-wJDw">International Commission of Inquiry</a> [UN News Centre report] on the CAR, tasked with examining reports of human rights violations, compiling information, and helping identify perpetrators. In February, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-car-leaders-personally-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">prompted</a> [JURIST report] CAR leaders to remember their legal obligations and stressed that they are personally accountable for human rights violations. Also that month, <a href="www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ethnic-cleansing-occurring-in-central-african-republic-ai.php">urged the international community</a> [JURIST report] to take immediate and effective action to halt the spread of sectarian violence and "ethnic cleansing" within the western part of the CAR. In January the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-rights-expert-warns-of-escalating-violance-in-central-african-republic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that urgent national and international action is necessary to stop the violence in CAR. Also in January the UN reported that more than 6,000 child soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/unicef-more-than-6000-child-soldiers-may-be-involved-in-car-fighting.php">may be involved</a> [JURIST report] in the conflict in CAR. Earlier in January the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-special-rapporteur-urges-humanitarian-assistance-in-central-african-republic.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to assist the approximately 1 million individuals who have been internally displaced by the ongoing violence in CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chevron prevailed earlier this month in its lawsuit against Donziger for fraud and racketeering and demands compensation for over $32 million the company allegedly spent in attorneys' fees associated with the trial. The racketeering trial was brought by Chevron in retaliation for a 2011 lawsuit between the same parties in which Donziger prevailed. That <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], brought by Donziger and litigated in Ecuador, found Chevron liable for 8.6 billion for polluting large areas of the Ecuadorian rain forest. Chevron subsequently brought and prevailed on charges that the Ecuadorian lawsuit was a "multinational criminal enterprise" intended to defraud and extort "one of the best-known companies in the world."

<p>Chevron's claim for reimbursement is the latest in the high-stakes legal drama between it and Donziger. In February 2011, an Ecuadorian court found Chevron liable for $8.6million, far short of the 113 billion Donziger originally sought. This amount was subsequently <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-damages-against-chevron-for-ecuador-oil-spill.php">increased</a>  [JURIST report] to $18 billion for Chevron's refusal to pay "moral reparations" to the Ecuadorian government, as required by the original ruling. Since Chevron owned no assets in Equador, a US District Court judge immediately <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-blocks-damages-in-chevron-pollution-case.php">halted </a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the judgment to eliminate the possibility that the plaintiffs would seek payment in other countries where Chevron does business. In September 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ended the injunction on enforcement but allowed Chevron to postpone payment pending its appeal of the verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Vladimir+Putin">news archive</a>] on Friday signed legislation making Crimea officially part of Russia. The bills passed the House almost unanimously despite significant international criticism. Others have called the measure <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/ukraine-crisis-russia-crimea-idUSL6N0MH12220140320">necessary</a> [Reuters report] to protect the ethnic Russians within Crimea, with Foreign Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sergei+lavrov">Sergei Lavrov</a> [JURIST news archive] telling the Duma that the unification would serve the interests of Russia. The signing comes just one day after US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/20/obama-extends-sanctions-against-russia-ukraine">announced new sanctions</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] against Russia. Putin has largely ignored these sanctions in the annexation process. The Crimean Peninsula, historically controlled by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, has been under control of pro-Russian forces since the <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-votes-to-remove-president.php">ousting</a> [JURIST report] of former Ukrainian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Viktor+Yanukovych">Viktor Yanukovich</a> [JURIST news archive] in late February.

The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">ongoing conflict</a> [BBC timeline] in Ukraine is being called the "biggest crisis between Russia and the West since the Cold War." Earlier this week Putin and representatives of Crimea <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/putin-signs-treaty-incorporating-crimea-into-russia.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that incorporates Crimea into the Russian Federation. Obama had previously <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's military intervention in the region as a violation of international law. Some have <a href="/forum/2014/03/curtis-doebbler-ukraine-hypocrisy.php">criticised</a> [JURIST op-ed] this condemnation as "hypoctritical." Ukraine's interim government in February <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/ukraine-interim-government-requests-international-arrest-warrant-for-yanukovych.php">requested an international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for former president Yanukovich, implicating him in the "mass murder" of civilians during protests in Kiev. Earlier that month US Vice President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice_president_biden/">Joe Biden</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-vice-president-threatens-sanctions-against-ukraine.php">threatened targeted sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Ukrainian officials responsible for violence against civilian protesters.]]></content:encoded>

The bill carves our narrow acceptable uses and is careful to make clear it is not meant to be a step towards outright legalization. Specifically, the bill legalizes the use of cannabidoils (CBD), which is high in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), for the treatment of children's seizures. Studies show that CBD has been effective in reducing the duration and frequency of seizures. In addition, the bill allows for clinical trials and further research to be done on the potential benefits of medical marijuana for cancer patients or those with glaucoma. The bill was paired with another measure that mandates insurance coverage for children with autism and passed the Senate unanimously, 54-0. The bill now goes back before the House for final approval.

<p>The use of marijuana for medical purposes and the <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legalization of marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for recreational use has garnered more <a href="http://www.mpp.org/">legal support</a> [Marijuana Policy Project website] in the US in recent months. Last month the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of the US Department of the Treasury issued <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-issues-guidelines-for-banks-to-service-marijuana-businesses.php">guidelines</a> [JURIST report] for banks to provide services to legal marijuana-related businesses, predominately in Colorado and Washington. In January the Florida Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/florida-voters-to-decide-on-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a citizen initiative to vote on an amendment to the state constitution on the legality of medical marijuana. Also in January New York Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/new-york-governor-proposes-medical-marijuana-pilot-program.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] plans for a medical marijuana pilot program which would permit up to 20 hospitals to distribute medical marijuana to patients with serious illnesses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ble Goude is accused of working with former Ivory Coast president  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gbagbo">news archives</a>] to orchestrate a wave of post-election violence between December 2010 and April 2011. Ble Goude is specifically charged with murder, rape, persecution and other inhuman acts from when he <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/01/us-ivorycoast-icc-idUSBRE9900FX20131001">led the youth wing</a> [Reuters report] of Gbagbo's movement against his political opponent Alassane Ouattara. Although Ble Goude has also been charged in Ivory Coast and wished to be tried by his own people, Justice Minister Mamadou Gnenema Coulibaly stated that he should be tried by the international community because he caused harm internationally.

<p>Ble Goude's arrest warrant, <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/icc-unseals-arrest-warrant-for-ivory-coast-politician.php">unsealed</a> [JURIST report] last October, is the third to be issued for crimes committed in the Ivory Coast during a civil war that broke out when Gbagbo refused to step down after losing the country's 2010 election. An Ivory Coast government statement was released in October reporting that Simone Gbagbo, the wife of Laurent Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-ivory-coast-first-lady-to-be-tried-in-domestic-court.php">would be tried in the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST report] on charges of crimes against humanity. In June judges at the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-postpones-proceedings-former-ivory-coast-president.php">gave prosecutors until November 15</a> [JURIST report] to develop their evidence against Laurent Gbagbo. Gbagbo is the first former head of state to come before the court.

Gbagbo's lawyers urged the court to rule that the ICC does not have jurisdiction and that Laurent Gbagbo should be tried by the Ivory Coast authorities currently conducting their own investigation. Gbagbo has been accused of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">crimes against humanity </a>[ICC arrest warrant] including murder, rape and persecution.

In a 6-3 decision, the court nullified the February election, deeming it unconstitutional due to the fact that all votes were not cast on the same day. Rather, protesters prevented candidates from registering and voting, through methods of physical location and intimidation, in 28 different constituencies. Thailand polls will now be reopened for another general election. This is expected to take at least three months. 

<p>Thailand has been fraught with political instability since the 2006 <a href="/forum/2006/09/disillusioned-with-democracy-tale-of.php">military coup</a>, [JURIST op-ed]. Thailand's Democrat party, the country's main opposition political party, <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/thailand-opposition-party-petitions-court-to-annul-election.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the Thai Constitutional Court last month to annul the results of last week's national elections, alleging that the polls were unconstitutional. In January 26, leading up to the elections an anti-government protest leader was <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/protest-leader-shot-to-death-in-thailand.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] during demonstrations blocking a voting station. The shooting came just five days after the Thai government <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/thailand-declares-state-of-emergency-over-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a 60-day state of emergency, granting it broad powers to curtail the political unrest, including the ability to censor media, impose a curfew and detain suspects without charges. These powers are in addition to those granted in November when the prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-prime-minister-invokes-special-security-law-amidst-protests.php">invoked</a> [JURIST report] a special security law known as the Internal Security Act, which conferred broader powers on police forces attempting to contain the protests. Just days later protesters <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/thailand-protesters-seek-help-overthrowing-government.php?edition=full">stormed</a> [JURIST report] the army's headquarters in Bangkok, seeking assistance in overthrowing the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26676071">attempting</a> [BBC report] to live up to his promise to release the remaining prisoners at the camp and to close the facility, but there are still 154 remaining detainees. The five prisoners will be granted refugee status in Uruguay, and though Mujica reportedly agreed to the proposal for humanitarian reasons, he has also acknowledged the possibility of some reciprocal action from the United States, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2014/03/uruguay-offers-take-guantanamo-prisoners-201432113126715197.html">reportedly</a> [Al Jazeera report] stating, "I don't do favors for free."

Obama has been attempting to reach agreements with nations to take more of the remaining Guantanamo detainees, and chose Uruguay because of its strong ties to the US and its position of leadership in South America.

<p>The continuing existence of the Guantanamo bay detention camp has been a <a href="/hotline/2014/03/wells-dixon-guantanamo-detainees.php">source</a> [JURIST op-ed] of frustration for the Obama administration and of political tension within the US, as many have denounced the President for failing to live up to his campaign promises to close the camp. The move to send the detainees to different countries has been difficult at best. The most recent transfer took place on March 13 with the <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/us-military-repatriates-algerian-guantanamo-detainee.php">repatriation</a> [JURIST report] of an Algerian detainee who attempted to resist the transfer based on his <em>in absentia</em> conviction of terrorism by Algerian authorities.

The investigation referred to allegations of "influence-peddling" in the country, and the evidence against Huang was reportedly <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gNgY3OlMzDdJuPrAei296A1JTK0g?docId=7218ec1a-e6a5-4a1e-ac2b-1fbf22fc5fe7">gathered</a> [AFP report] by a wiretap on the phone of an opposition party leader. Huang was charged with three violations of the Communication Security and Surveillance Act, and was <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2014/03/22/2003586252">convicted</a> [<em>Taipei Times</em> report] on all three charges, receiving two five-month and one six-month sentences.  Huang is the first Prosecutor-general to be convicted in Taiwan, though he may appeal the sentence or to pay a fine of approximately $14,000 instead of serving the prison sentence. In response to the conviction, <a href="http://www.president.gov.tw/">President Ma Ying-jeou's</a> [official website, in Chinese] popularity has shrunk to even lower levels, and the scandal has reportedly been described by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party as the Taiwanese version of the 1974 Watergate scandal that resulted in the resignation of former US president Richard Nixon. Huang has resigned from his office, holding to his earlier promises to step down from office if convicted. 

<p>The Taiwanese government has faced massive struggles against corruption in recent years and in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/taiwan-launches-anti-corruption-agency.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] the Agency Against Corruption (AAC) to try to weed out corrupt officials and practices and to deter corruption in the future. That announcement came just one month after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on-embezzlement-charges.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] of former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui on charges of embezzlement and money laundering.

In November 2010 Taiwanese authorities indicted 13 people on charges of bribery, corruption and money laundering, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-judicial-officials-indicted-on-bribery-corruption-charges.php">including</a> [JURIST report] three High Court judges. The indictments came after authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/taiwan-prosecutors-raid-judges.php">raided</a> [JURIST report] the homes of several High Court officials suspected of accepting bribes to reduce sentences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ban came after <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XikJkZ8XWoo">audio recordings</a> [recordings, in Turkish] of a voice, resembling Erdogan's, instructed his son to dispose of large amounts of money during a police search were leaked via Twitter. Ergodan denies corruption and has claimed the recordings were fabricated to discredit him in the upcoming election. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] researcher Emma Sinclair-Webb <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/21/dispatches-turkey-shuts-down-twitter">said</a> [press release] that the ban was implemented in order to hide damaging recordings before the upcoming election. When users <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2014/03/21/turkey-blocks-twitter-access-over-graft-recordings">attempted</a> [AP report] to access the site, they instead saw a notice citing court orders. Among those users that circumvented the ban was <a href="http://www.tccb.gov.tr/pages/">President Abdullah Gul</a> [official website], who has been vocal about opposing Internet censorship. 

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world. Despite Gul condemning the ban, in February the president <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-president-approves-controversial-internet-bill.php">approved legislation to heighten Internet restrictions</a> [JURIST report], granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without a court's approval. Last year a Canadian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">unveiled research</a> [JURIST report] indicating that a number of nations are using American-made Internet surveillance technology which could be used to censor content and track their citizens. The UN Human Rights Council in July 2012 passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect the free speech</a> [JURIST report] of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. Also in 2012 China <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">adopted stricter rules</a> [JURIST report] on both Internet providers and users. In November of 2012 Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] giving the government the authority to completely block access to certain websites. In July of 2012 the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] intended to protect Internet speech. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Historically, illegal guerrilla groups within Colombia have been concentrated within the rural areas outside of Buenaventura. Recently, the military successor groups known as the Urabenos and the Empresa have centered their efforts into the urban areas of Buenaventura. HRW states in its report that these specific groups within the city have recruited inhabitants' children, extorted their businesses and acted violently towards anybody who have opposed them. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/123657/section/2">press release</a> [text] accompanying the report, HRW details the gruesome acts perpetrated by these groups: <blockquote>Several residents we spoke with report having heard people scream and plea for mercy as they were being dismembered alive. In March 2014, after criminal investigators found bloodstains in two suspected 'chop-up houses' in the city, the police said they had identified several locations where perpetrators had dismembered victims alive before tossing them in the sea. </blockquote>These  acts have driven many citizens from their homes and have contributed to Columbia's large population of internally displaced people.

<p>Criminal activity by illegal armed groups has been an ongoing issue within Colombia. In August Colombia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/colombia-high-court-rules-peace-law-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law providing reduced penalties for rebels who confess crimes related to their membership in illegal armed groups is constitutional. The bill, known as the "Legal Framework for Peace," was challenged by rights activists who claimed that by granting judicial pardons to rebels, it is "contrary to the State's duty to investigate and punish crimes, especially main violations of human rights" and that its measures to satisfy victim's rights are inadequate. In its reasoning, the court analyzed the bill's balance between the pursuit of peace and the rights of victims. In November 2012 a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/colombia-approves-law-for-peace-talks-with-armed-forces.php">expressed serious concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding the expansion of military justice jurisdiction, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12842&LangID=E">claiming </a>[press release] it would "seriously undermine previous efforts undertaken by the Colombian Government to ensure that human rights violations, allegedly committed by members of the Colombian military and police forces, are duly investigated and perpetrators held to account."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/FE9EDC4B5E2C6D9E85257CA2004FB19A/$file/13-5270-1484753.pdf">overturned</a> [text, PDF] a lower court  that struck down the Federal Reserve's cap on how much banks are permitted to charge businesses for debit card transactions. The lawsuit was initiated by a coalition of retail groups that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-appeals-court-upholds-feds-cap-swipe-fees-23003885">argued</a> [AP report] that the cap was too high. The Federal Reserve initially proposed a 12 cent fee per swipe as the cap, but the average fee is now 24 cents per transaction. The retailers argued that Congress gave in to pressure from bank lobbyists when agreeing on the higher fee. In July a federal judge agreed with the retailers and <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-strikes-down-cap-on-debit-card-transaction-fees.php">struck down the law</a> [JURIST report], saying that the Federal Reserve lacked the authority to set the fee limit because it improperly included unnecessary data that pushed the fee higher. The DC Circuit disagreed, deciding to defer to the Federal Reserve's interpretation of the law and rejecting the retailers' challenge to the law's reasonableness. 

<p>The debit card fee limit was included in the Dodd-Frank Act, which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 and created the new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent companies from becoming "too big to fail." In addition to creating the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx">US Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [official website], the legislation also gives the Federal Reserve new oversight over the largest financial institutions, creates a bureau of consumer protection, introduces multitudes of new regulations on derivatives and other financial instruments, tasks the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) [official website] with regulating the derivatives market and limits the amount of capital banks can invest in hedge funds. JURIST contributor Andrew Cali-Vasquez <a href="/dateline/2011/10/andrew-cali-vasquez-dodd-frank.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that position limit regulations may carry unexpected consequences that "could impinge upon the operations of domestic businesses by reducing the availability of financing." JURIST Guest Columnist Louise Bennetts gives a <a href="/hotline/2013/01/louise-bennetts-dodd-frank.php">critique of Dodd-Frank</a> [JURIST op-ed], arguing that its framework gives regulators considerably leeway to implement its measures as they see fit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled Thursday in <a href="https://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2014/115776.pdf">People v. Clark</a> and <a href="https://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2014/114852.pdf">People v. Melongo</a> [opinions, PDF], which both dealt with audio recording, striking down the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?DocName=072000050HArt.+14&ActID=1876&ChapterID=53&SeqStart=33800000&SeqEnd=35000000">Illinois Eavesdropping Act</a> [text]. The 1961 Act had made it a felony to record audio of conversations without the consent of all parties involved. In its rulings, the court made it clear that the law was so broad that it could include recording "a loud argument on the street, a political debate on a college quad, yelling fans at an athletic event, or any conversation loud enough that the speakers should expect to be heard by others."  

<p>This isn't the first time that the Illinois law has suffered a defeat. In 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/seventh-circuit-rules-videotaping-public-police-work-is-not-eavesdropping.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a provision of the law that barred people from taking video of police officers performing their jobs in public. Later that year the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/112612zor_f204.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in the case, letting the court of appeals decision stand. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/victory-for-first-amendment-right-to-audio-record-police/">heralded</a> [press release] the decision at the time. An ACLU spokesperson noted, "empowering individuals and organizations in this fashion will ensure additional transparency and oversight of police across the State." The ACLU pointed out that new technologies have made recording and gathering information much easier and noted the importance of the people's ability to gather information about government conduct.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The signing comes three days after Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] and representatives of Crimea <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/putin-signs-treaty-incorporating-crimea-into-russia.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that incorporates Crimea into the Russian Federation. It also signals a closer relationship between Ukraine and the EU. The association agreement emphasizes the importance of respecting human rights, the rule of law and sustainable development.

Former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4038803.stm">Viktor Yanukovich</a> [BBC profile] originally opposed the agreement in favor of closer ties with Russia.

The bill was passed just before the end of the legislative session in a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/georgia-house-passes-controversial-gun-bill">112-58 vote</a> [MSNBC report]. It would allow permit-holders to bring firearms into previously gun-free establishments and also give teachers and other authorized officials the right to carry weapons in school zones. The bill also removes penalties for carrying a firearm in unauthorized locations. Brian Malte, senior national policy director for the <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/">Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a> [advocacy website], expressed concern over the legislation, stating, &#8220;There are some states that take guns anywhere, anytime, and virtually for everyone, and they do it in piecemeal. Georgia has decided to do it all in one bill.&#8221; Supporters of the bill argue, however, that it allows for a greater sense of self-protection. The bill has already been passed by the Georgia Senate and is expected to go before <a href="http://gov.georgia.gov/">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website] for approval soon.

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have been litigated in federal court. California Attorney General <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/">Kamala Harris</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/california-ag-asks-federal-court-to-reverse-decision-striking-down-gun-control-laws.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in February, asking the court to reverse a decision striking down a law requiring residents to show good cause to carry a concealed firearm. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-gun-rights-cases.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] three <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] cases that had requested review.

The report shows a notable increase in asylum claims across industrialized countries compared to recent years. Unlike in recent years, however, where Afghanistan has been the most common country of origin, Syria was the top asylum originator for 2013. The report suggests that this is a clear shift in conflict zones creating refugees. Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Iraq and Pakistan are all in the top ten of refugee origination in addition to Syria, and all experience some type of internal conflict. These conflict areas create an increase in acceptance rates of refugees, as those from conflict zones have a 62 to 95 percent chance of acceptance, while political refugees from Russia and Serbia, also in the top ten, have an acceptance rate of 5 to 28 percent. There were a total of 612,700 new asylum applications in 2013, which was the most since 2001. 

<p>Immigration continues to be a prevalent international issue. Earlier in March <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/ai-cyprus-detention-of-asylum-seekers-violates-eu-law.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the Cyprus government's international law violations by detaining refugees on an island before addressing their claims.

Also in February, an Australian human rights agency <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/australia-to-investigate-effects-of-detention-on-undocumented-immigrant-children.php">launched</a> [JURIST report] an inquiry into how the government was treating immigrants.

Judge Bernard Friedman ruled that the ban violates the US Constitution's guarantee of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection</a> [text, Cornell LII] and also indicated that the state had failed to prove its allegation that children lacking "biologically connected" gender role models face difficulties in psychological development. Friedman also rejected the argument that the ban should be upheld because it was approved by voter referendum. "[S]tate defendants lost sight of what this case is truly about: people," said Friedman. The decision follows similar federal court rulings striking down same-sex marriage bans in <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-in-texas-declares-state-ban-on-gay-marriage-unconstitutional.php">Texas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-utah-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-virgina-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST reports], but the Michigan ruling is unique in that there was no stay placed on the effect of the decision pending appeal. County clerks are expected to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday.

<p>Same-sex marriage is one of the most hotly debated topics in the legal community today. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed two lawsuits in March challenging same-sex marriage bans in <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-challenges-indiana-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports].

A week prior, four couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Wyoming state court challenging that state's ban on same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/SuperiorCourt/index.asp">The Maricopa County Superior Court </a> [official website] on Friday ruled that Arizonans may use marijuana extracts for medical conditions. The Arizona chapter of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-arizona-medical-marijuana-regulation.php">filed the lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] in October on behalf of the Welton family seeking a declaration that the marijuana derivative used to treat five-year-old Zander Welton's epilepsy is permissible under the <a href="http://www.azdhs.gov/medicalmarijuana/rules/">Arizona Medical Marijuana Act</a> (AMMA) [materials] and, in addition, local prosecutors must stop pursuing charges against Zander's parents. Judge Katherine Cooper found that the AMMA allows patients to use marijuana extracts without fear of prosecution: <blockquote>It makes no sense to interpret the AMMA as allowing people ... to use medical marijuana but only if they take it in one particular form. Such an interpretation reduces, if not eliminates, medical [marijuana] as a treatment option for those who cannot take it in plant form, or who could receive a greater benefit from an alternative form.</blockquote>
Zander's parents had been successfully treating his seizures with a combination of CBD oil, a non-psychoactive help extract, and marijuana. However, due to fear of prosecution, the Weltons were forced to stop using the CBD oil and rely only on marijuana, which was less effective for Zander and more difficult to properly dose and administer. According to ACLU Staff Attorney Emma Andersson, Maricopa County had <a href="https://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/court-victory-allows-arizonans-use-marijuana-extracts-medical-conditions">placed a "cruel obstacle"</a> [press release] between Zander and the medicine that had "drastically reduced his seizures." Andersson noted that the court's ruling means the county can "no longer interfere" with sick patients' access to marijuana "in the form that best suits their medical needs," which she asserts is "precisely what Arizonans intended" when they voted for the medical marijuana ballot initiative.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] was a hot-button issue in several states in the<a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php"> November 2012 election</a> [JURIST report]. In Washington voters <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">approved an initiative </a>[Initiative 502, PDF] to allow the possession and distribution of marijuana through a state-licensing system of marijuana growers, processors and stores, where adults can buy up to an ounce. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative </a>[Amendment 64, PDF] actually introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and to privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">failed by approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote. Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3 </a>[Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [Harvard Crimson report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52-to-48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana.

The EU's <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission </a> [official website] on Sunday announced plans to sue the UK with respect to its welfare policies, under which migrants must pass a "right to reside" test in order to gain access to the government's welfare programs. The "right to reside" test requires migrants from other EU countries to prove that they are seeking work before they can claim benefits. The <a href="http://rt.com/news/eu-britain-benefits-court-697/">action is being brought</a> [RT report] by the office of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/andor/index_en.htm">Laszlo Andor</a> [official website], the EU Commissioner for social affairs and employment. Andor reportedly argues the test is discriminatory on grounds that British citizens are not required to take it. The test was first introduced by the Labour Party in an attempt to ease concerns over "benefit tourists" who might otherwise take advantage of the country's benefits system, one of the most generous and accessible welfare programs in the EU. If the UK loses the case, it may face multi-million pound fines for not complying with EU rules, or it will be forced to change the law.

<p>The timing of the lawsuit is believed by some to be "politically explosive" as it is being introduced ahead of the May EU elections. The <a href="http://www.ukip.org/">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP) [party website] is said to likely use the lawsuit in its election campaign by urging voters to vote in favor of pulling out of the EU to regain control of its welfare budget. In November, the UK House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/uk-house-of-commons-approves-bill-to-hold-EU-membership-referendum.php">approved of a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will order a nationwide referendum in 2017 to determine whether the UK will remain within the EU. Twenty MPs of the <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">Conservative Party</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/group-of-mps-pushing-for-eu-referendum-before-2015.php">urged Cameron</a> [JURIST report] in May to expedite a nationwide referendum in response to results from local elections earlier that month in which the UKIP, a group with a focus on removing UK ties to the EU, received 26 percent of the vote in <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1086321/local-council-elections-ukip-make-big-gains">county polls </a>[Sky News report]. Cameron had previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-prime-minister-proposes-referendum-on-eu-membership.php">guaranteed</a> [JURIST report] in January that if his party were to win the next election in 2015, the Tories would then push legislation for the referendum. This is not the first time, however, that the UK has considered such a proposal. In 2011, Parliament voted 483-111 <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-parliament-votes-down-referendum-on-eu-membership.php">against holding a national referendum</a>[JURIST report] on remaining a member of the EU. If that proposal had been approved, the referendum would have put forward three options for a vote: to remain in the EU, to leave the EU, or to re-negotiate membership terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling arrived one day after Friday's <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/Federal-judge-declares-Michigan-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by a judge for the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] that held that the ban on same-sex marriages in Michigan is unconstitutional. Following the decision on Friday, a number of couples in Michigan entered into same-sex marriages, and the legality of their partnerships is now in question. The federal appeals court issued a temporary stay in the case until Wednesday. 

<p>The heated debate regarding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the <a href="/dateline/2013/09/stephen-richer-gay-marriage.php">most polarizing</a> [JURIST op-ed] issues currently facing the US legal community. Friday's decision made Michigan the 18th state in the US to recognize same-sex marriages. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed two lawsuits challenging same-sex marriage bans in <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-challenges-indiana-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports]. Also this month, a federal judge for the US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-orders-tennessee-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages-pending-lawsuit.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction ordering the state of Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state until a lawsuit challenging the ban can be heard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EU imposed the sanctions on the same day Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Vladimir+Putin">news archive</a>] finalized legislation making Crimea officially part of Russia. Earlier last week, the EU announced restrictions against 21 individuals in Russia and Ukraine, and the US ordered similar sanctions against 11 individuals. EU leaders have prepared further economic sanctions in the event Russia expands its intervention beyond Crimea into eastern Ukraine. <a href="http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president">European Council President Herman Van Rompuy</a> [official website] called Russia's annexation of Crimea "a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and of international law" and Van Rompuy said that the 28-nation bloc will cancel an EU-Russia summit in June.

On appeal from the <a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], the <em>habeas</em> petitioner in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jennings-v-stephens/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Jennings v. Stephens</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] was sentenced to death in state court in the late 1980s. The state court denied petitioner's <em>habeas</em> claim, in which he argued his counsel failed to investigate adequately evidence of his impaired mental condition. Petitioner filed a federal court <em>habeas</em> petition, and the district court found that petitioner made out an ineffective counsel claim, despite the state court's findings. The Fifth Circuit, however, reversed on grounds that the district court was required to adhere to the state court's findings and that petitioner's claims were time-barred for his failure to file a separate notice of appeal and Certificate of Appealability. Petitioner now raises a question that has split the federal circuits: whether a federal <em>habeas</em> petitioner can raise arguments in opposition to a state's appeal concerning grounds for relief not adopted by a federal district court, without first filing a separate notice of appeal and a Certificate of Appealability.

<p>The US Supreme Court has heard a variety of criminal procedure cases recently. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-pre-trial-asset-freeze.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 6-3 in <u>Kaley v. United States</u> that a criminal defendant who has been indicted is not constitutionally entitled to contest a grand jury's finding of probable cause underlying a pre-trial seizure of assets. In December the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-rules-on-fifth-amendment-issue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST] in <span class="casename">Kansas v. Cheever</span> that the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit the government from introducing evidence from a court-ordered mental evaluation of a criminal defendant to rebut that defendant's presentation of expert testimony in support of a defense of voluntary intoxication. In November the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Fernandez v. California</span>, considering whether the Fourth Amendment allows police to search an individual's home based solely on a co-tenant's consent after the police arrested the objecting individual and removed him from the scene.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The SCAF <a href="http://www.gpb.org/news/2014/03/24/egyptian-court-orders-prominent-activist-freed-on-bail">accuses</a> [NPR report] Abdel Fatah of inciting violence during protests in October, in which 27 people were killed and 300 people were injured. Abdel Fatah is currently on trial with 24 co-defendants, all of whom are charged with organizing public protests without prior government approval, destroying public property and assaulting members of the police. Abdel Fatah is reportedly known throughout Egypt for his criticism of the nation's shifting regimes. He was imprisoned once during the rule of Hosni Mubarak in 2006, and again during military rule in 2011. Reports indicate that Abdel Fatah's release on bail does not mean he has avoided conviction and sentencing for his alleged crimes.

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Conflict has recently occurred between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Muhammed Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">ouster</a> in July, especially since the organization's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">formal ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-office-voices-concern-over-egypt-military-trial-for-blogger.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] about human rights violations in Egypt in November 2011, specifically with respect to the military trial and jailing of a blogger/activist" Abdel Fatah.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI also called for the unconditional release of Gu Yimin, who was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/03/china-jails-tiananmen-activist-subversion-201432463929104806.html">found guilty</a> [Al Jazeera report] on Monday of inciting state subversion by a court in Changshu for attempting to post images of the 1989 crackdown online last year and applying to stage a protest on its twenty-fourth anniversary. Yimin's lawyer maintained that the judgment violated the constitution and that Yimin was exercising his right to free speech, adding that he would appeal the verdict. AI's China Researcher, Anu Kultalahti, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/china-fears-crackdown-ahead-tiananmen-square-anniversary-2014-03-24">stated</a> [press release] that the twenty-fifth anniversary could mark the start of the "annual round-up of activists attempting to remember the tragic events of 1989," and that the authorities should acknowledge what really happened in order to deliver justice to those victims. 

<p>The Tiananmen protests began in April 1989 with mainly students and laborers protesting the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government declared martial law in May and initiated the violent dispersal of protesters by the People's Liberation Army on June 4. The Chinese government has never publicized official figures, but the Hong Kong-based <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/">Information Center for Human Rights &#38; Democracy</a> [advocacy website] reported last year that unnamed sources had <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/main/messages/16647.html">estimated 600 people were killed</a> [ICHR report, in Chinese]. In 2012 Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">detained hundreds of activists</a> [JURIST report] in Beijing marking the twenty-third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. In 2011 the US State Department urged the Chinese government to release protestors arrested for peaceful protests in the square in 1989. Human rights and democracy advocates in 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-advocates-urge-reform-on-20th.php">called on the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the 1989 uprising, provide an accurate count of those killed in the government's response to the uprising, and to accept reform outlines set forth in the Charter 08 proposal. In August 2008 Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/china-releases-political-activist-after.php">released</a> [JURIST report] activist <a href="http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/1820/prmID/172">Hu Shigen </a>[profile], sentenced to 20 years in prison for carrying out counterrevolutionary propaganda, including organizing events commemorating the uprising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The verdicts, which came after only two sessions, are <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/24/egypt-sentences-529-mohammed-morsi-supporters-to-death-on-charges-of-attacking-police/">subject to appeal</a> [AP report] and likely to be overturned, according to legal experts. Experts also say that the harshness of the rulings illustrates the lengths to which Egypt's courts have been politicized and due process has been ignored during a crackdown on Morsi's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] supporters following the president's removal in a military coup last July. During the first of the two trial sessions in Minya, the judge rejected requests by defense lawyers for more time to review trial documents for the defendants, leading to furious arguments. Defense lawyers were barred by security forces from the second session on Monday when verdicts and sentences were read. 

<p>Trials against Morsi supporters have been held as the Egyptian government attempts to re-stabilize. In February Egyptian authorities ordered 242 supporters of former president to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-officials-order-new-trials-for-supporters-of-ousted-president-mohammed-morsi.php">face new trials</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the violent protests against the new government. Earlier that week the<a href="http://www.ibanet.org/IBAHRI.aspx"> International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/rights-group-urges-egypt-to-promote-judicial-prosecutorial-independence.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] Egypt to promote judicial and prosecutorial independence. Also in February, Egypt's interim president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23176293">Adly Mansour </a>[BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-to-allow-military-court-appeals.php">created </a>[JURIST report] a higher court body to allow appeals of military tribunal rulings. Earlier that month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-acquits-al-jazeera-cameraman.php">acquitted </a>[JURIST report] an Al Jazeera television cameraman and 61 others accused of participating in demonstrations in Cairo last July. In January Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-prosecutors-charge-20-journalists-with-terrorism-related-charges.php">charged </a>[JURIST report] 20 Al Jazeera journalists with joining or conspiring with a terrorist group and broadcasting false images.

The lower court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-appeals-court-rules-delaware-secret-arbitration-rule-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the provision that allows confidential judge-run arbitration hearings violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1toc_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] but stated that the decision does not invalidate the entire statute. It noted that the decision is based solely on the fact that the proceedings "are conducted outside the public view, not because of any problem otherwise inherent in a Judge-run arbitration scheme." The constitutional challenge was <a href="http://jenner.com/system/assets/assets/5748/original/Delaware_20Coalition_20v._20Strine.pdf?1326223902">originally filed</a> [complaint, PDF] by the <a href="http://delcog.org/">Delaware Coalition for Open Government </a>(DCOG) [advocacy website] in 2011 in response to the 2009 <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis145.nsf/c6fe685e20e98b2b882569a60053971e/1285ac50670f182f85257546006116dc?OpenDocument">dispute resolution amendment</a> [HB 49, text], which was adopted by the state in an effort to promote Delaware's reputation as a preferable state in which to resolve business disputes. The Supreme Court provided no reason for their denial of this case. 

<p>Arbitration is becoming an increasingly popular form of dispute resolution around the world, leading to various legal opinions and controversies surrounding its use. In 2012, Shafiq Jamoos, co-owner of the Jamoos Law Office, reviewed the <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/shafiq-jamoos-arbitration-litigation.php">costs and benefits of international arbitration</a> [JURIST comment] compared to traditional litigation, writing that there is no definitive answer as to which is an inherently "better" process. A month earlier Russia's Federal Arbitration Court ordered British Petroleum (BP) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-court-orders-bp-to-pay-31-billion-in-damages.php">pay 100 billion rubles (US$3.1 billion) in damages</a> [JURIST report] to TNK-BP, BP's 50-50 joint venture with Alfa Access Renova (AAR) [corporate websites], a consortium representing four Russian billionaire tycoons. Earlier in that year Dmytro Vorobey, an LL.M.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-299_3kg4.pdf">Clark v.

In October 2010, the Clarks filed voluntary joint bankruptcy and claimed an inherited IRA under the Section 522 exemption, which the bankruptcy trustee and creditors objected to using. The district court ruled that inherited IRAs are exempted because they retain their character as retirement funds, but the <a href="https://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/In_re_Clark_714_F3d_559_55_EBC_1756_7th_Cir_2013_Court_Opinion">reversed</a> [opinion] that ruling. The Supreme Court must decide if inherited IRAs qualify as a "retirement fund," which will determine access to those IRAs after a debtor begins bankruptcy filings.

<p>Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had another opportunity to rule on bankruptcy law. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/law-v-siegel/">Law v. Siegel</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-rules-bankruptcy-court-exceeded-authority.php">report</a>], the Supreme Court <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Law_v_Siegel_No_125196_2014_BL_57926_US_Mar_04_2014_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] unanimously that a bankruptcy court improperly exceeded its authority by ordering legally exempt funds to be used to pay attorney's costs. A trustee of a bankruptcy claim later discovered that the debtor had fraudulently represented certain liens on the his property in order to protect the $75000, and claimed the money as compensation for the added costs of discovering the fraud. The bankruptcy court agreed, and its decision was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court reversed, saying that the bankruptcy court exceeded its authority by using it to "sanction abusive litigation practices." The court held that the bankruptcy court had no authority to override a state law exemption to penalize a dishonest party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The day was <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/196">established in 2010</a> [resolution, PDF] by the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] to commemorate the death of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, who was assassinated in El Salvador on March 24, 1980, for publicly denouncing violations of the human rights and human dignity occurring in El Salvador.

<p>Over the past year, the UN has supported the establishment of numerous Commissions of Inquiry in countries throughout the world. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-council-to-investigate-north-korea-human-rights-violations.php">establishing a Commission of Inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate ongoing human rights violations in North Korea.

The trial, which has been decried internationally for failing to provide due process to the accused, comes just one day after the same court sentenced 529 suspected Morsi supporters to death after just two sessions in a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-sentences-529-morsi-supporters-to-death.php">similar mass trial</a> [JURIST report]. Reports indicate that human rights groups have strongly criticized these large-scale proceedings where defense lawyers have not been allowed to present their cases. 

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Much of that conflict has recently occurred between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/egypt-military-deposes-president-morsi-suspends-constitution.php">ouster</a> in July 2013, especially since the organization's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">formal ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. On March 18, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-sentences-police-officers-for-deaths-of-37-islamists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four police officers for their role in the deaths of 37 Islamists. Opponents have criticized the light sentences handed down to the officers. A day earlier, an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/morsis-son-referred-to-trial-for-drug-possession.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] Morsi's youngest son, Abdullah Morsi, to trial on allegations of drug use and possession.

The case revolved around the use of certain microchips allowing refurbished printing cartridges to be used in Lexmark printers. <a href="http://www.lexmark.com/en_US/">Lexmark</a> [official website] developed a chip only allowing cartridges refurbished and sold by the company to be used while its competitor <a href="http://www.scc-inc.com/">Static</a> [official website] developed a chip performing the same function, except allowing third-party refurbished cartridges to be used. The Lanham Act counterclaim challenged letters sent by Lexmark to companies using the Static ship informing them that the use was illegal. Static still must prove it suffered harm as a result of the letters, but the decision <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/25/lexmark-may-be-liable-for-attacking-printer-cartridge-rivals-supreme-court-says/">allows</a> [Forbes report] the use of a Lanham Act claim to prevent companies from discouraging competition by issuing cease and desist letters claiming illegal use or copyright infringement. Reports indicated that companies will now have to be certain about making such allegations, as potential for liability for false advertisement will exist if the claims about illegal use cause harm to another business and are proven to be false. This decision did not adjudicate the merits of either the copyright infringement or the Lanham Act claim. 

<p>A wide array of intellectual property disputes have occurred recently. The Youtube controversy between Google and Viacom was recently <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/google-and-viacom-settle-copyright-infringement-suit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] after more than six years, though the financial details of the agreement were not disclosed.

Quality Stores, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that involuntarily  terminated severance packages given to employees are subject to wage taxation under the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleC-chap21.pdf">Federal Insurance Contributions Act</a> (FICA) [text, PDF]. The case stems from the bankruptcy of Quality Stores, a former agricultural speciality retailer based in Michigan. Quality Stores closed more than 300 locations in 2001 and 2002 and terminated its remaining employees as part of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing initiated in 2001. Quality stores paid and withheld taxes required under FICA and subsequently filed for a refund with the <a href="http://www.irs.gov">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] on behalf of itself and approximately 1,850 former employees. When the IRS did not allow or deny the refund, Quality Stores initiated proceedings in bankruptcy court, which granted summary judgment in its favor. Tuesday's opinion reversed a <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] ruling in favor of the government. 

<p>The court held that severance payments squarely fall within the definition of wages for purposes of income-tax withholding under FICA and that these payments qualify under the broad definition of wages as "all remuneration for employment" as defined by FICA. The court reasoned that severance packages are similar to many other benefits employers offer to employees above and beyond salary payments, and the court rejected Quality Store's argument that the payments represented supplemental unemployment compensation, not wages. With approximately 2,000 FICA tax refunds and a (USD) $1 million refund bid from Quality Stores at stake, this case has drawn the attention of tax professionals around the US. In 2013, the IRS suspended all refund claims for FICA taxes in the Sixth Circuit pending the resolution of this issue. JURIST Guest Columnists Catherine E. Livingston and Lori Hellkamp of Jones Day <a href="/sidebar/2014/01/livingston-hellkamp-fica-severance.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the potential consequences of <u>US v. Quality Stores, Inc.</u> on severance pay under FICA in January. <br />

Judge Amalya Kearse rejected Gupta's claim that wiretap evidence should not have been admitted against him. Gupta was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/former-goldman-sachs-director-convicted-of-fraud.php">convicted</a> of three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in June 2012, primarily upon the basis of statements he made by phone to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive], head of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm, informing him of Goldman Sachs' investments and financial results. Judge Kearse found "ample" evidence in the statements to support Gupta's conviction. The district court sentenced Gupta to two years in prison, one year of supervised release and a (USD) $5 million fine.

<p>The Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-hedge-fund-managers-conviction.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of Gupta's co-conspirator Rajaratnam in June 2013, rejecting a similar claim that wiretap evidence should not have been admitted against him. Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] in May 2011 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to fines totaling almost (USD) $64 million and 11 years in prison, the longest sentence ever handed down for insider trading.

Since Colorado legalized recreational marijuana through a voter initiative in 2012, many attorneys have reportedly expressed concern over  involving themselves in the trade for fear of violating the <a href="http://www.cobar.org/index.cfm/ID/22119/CETH/Colorado-Rules-of-Professional-Conduct/">Colorado Rules of Professional Conduct</a> (CRPC) [text], which prohibits attorneys from assisting clients in illegal activity. Growing and selling marijuana is still illegal on the federal level. The <a href="http://www.cobar.org/index.cfm/ID/20202/CETH/Ethics-Committee/">Colorado Bar Association Ethics Committee</a> [official website] adopted a formal <a href="http://www.cobar.org/tcl/tcl_articles.cfm?articleid=8370">opinion</a> [tex] in October expressing concern that the state has placed its marijuana decriminalization "experiment" at risk "by putting its lawyers in jeopardy of violating its rules of professional conduct." The Colorado Supreme Court's Standing Committee on the CRPC made a recommendation that the state's high court amend the CRPC to protect lawyers from being disciplined for providing "legal services and advice on marijuana-related conduct." 

<p>The Colorado Supreme Court decision continues the state's attempts to regulate the drug since the state's 2012 voter initiative, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] the state constitution to allow adults over 21 to possess an ounce or less of marijuana and to privately grow up to six marijuana plants. The following May, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-governor-signs-bills-regulating-recreational-marijuana.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] several new laws regulating the use and sale of recreational marijuana. Last summer, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-colorado-marijuana-magazine-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Colorado law requiring that marijuana-related magazines, like pornographic magazines, be kept behind the counters of the businesses that sold them. In November, Colorado voters <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/colorado-voters-approve-tax-on-recreational-marijuan.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/results/2013-2014/PropositionAAText.pdf">Proposition AA,</a> [text, pdf] which levied taxes on all sales of recreational marijuana in the state to help fund public school construction and state sales tax reserves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The former co-workers include: ex-director of operations Daniel Bonventre, former executive assistant Annette Bongiorno, ex-manager of company bank accounts JoAnn Crupi, and computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/24/us-madoff-employees-idUSBREA2N1EU20140324">five-month trial</a> [Reuters report] was the first criminal trial resulting from the 2008 Madoff Ponzi scheme and the defendants will be sentenced in late July. The jury rejected the defendants' central argument that only Madoff was aware of the fraud and they found the co-workers <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/5-former-madoff-employees-found-guilty-of-fraud/">knowingly</a> [NYT report] aided in the financial conspiracy.

<p>Legal action continues from the fallout of the 2008 Madoff Ponzi scheme. In January a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/district-court-judge-upholds-jpmogran-settlement.php">approved</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jp-morgan-chase-agrees-to-settlement-penalty-in-madoff-case.php">settlement</a> [JURIST reports] between the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/">US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] and JPMorgan Chase over the bank's failure to report internal suspicions regarding Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In September 2013 a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov/">US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/madoff-victims-not-entitled-to-interest-bankruptcy-judge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that victims can only recover the principal amount invested without accounting for inflation over the past five years and excluding interest. Last April a judge for the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-madoff-victims-suit-against-sec.php">rejected a suit</a> [JURIST report] by victims against the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The laws, found in San Francisco's Police Code at Sections <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/city/ca/SanFrancisco/Police%20Code/article45.pdf">4512</a> and <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/city/ca/SanFrancisco/Police%20Code/article09.pdf">613.10</a> [text], require gun owners to secure weapons in their homes by storing them in a locker, keeping them on their bodies or applying trigger locks, and prohibit the sale of hollow-point ammunition. Writing for the court, Judge Sandra Ikuta stated that the gun law restrictions still allow for the ready access of guns. Moreover, gun owners may buy the banned ammunition outside of the city, as the law only prohibits the sale of the bullets and not the possession. The court concluded that when no substantial burden is present, the law must pass intermediate scrutiny. The case, <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/3:2009cv02143/215014">Jackson v. City &#38; County of San Francisco</a> [Justia backgrounder], was brought by gun owners in San Francisco and the <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [official website]. Lead attorney for the NRA Chuck Michel announced plans to petition the court to hear the case again by an 11-judge panel, stating that "self-defense is not a sport."

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have been litigated in federal court. In February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-gun-rights-cases.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] three new petitions that would address the scope of the Second Amendment. In January a federal district court in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> the constitutionality of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">new gun control law</a> [JURIST report], which added 100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban. That same month a federal judge in Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/chicago-gun-sales-ban-ruled-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] part of Chicago's gun ordinance banning the licensed sale of firearms in the city. Also in January a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-most-of-new-york-gun-law.php">upheld</a> most of state's <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/new-york-governow-signs-gun-control-measures-into-law.php">new gun control law</a>, among the most restrictive in the country, but struck down a provision prohibiting owners to load more than seven rounds into a magazine [JURIST reports]. In May a group of Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">filed a federal law suit</a> challenging a series of gun control laws <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> into law in the aftermath of the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado [JURIST reports]. In early 2013, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> Congress to enact stricter gun control laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Michigan</a> [materials] that struck down Michigan's same-sex marriage ban. The court granted the stay in light of the US Supreme Court's issuance of a stay in a similar case, <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/13a687-herber-v-kitchen-order.pdf">Herbert v. Kitchen</a> [order, PDF], earlier this year. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs opposed the stay, arguing that lifting it would promote equality and human dignity, as well as provide security for children. Michigan issued hundreds of marriage licenses over the weekend after Judge Bernard Friedman <a href="http://www.equalitymi.org/files/March2014-DeBoer-ruling.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Friday that the ban violates the US Constitution's guarantee of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection</a> [text, Cornell LII]. In so ruling, he also indicated that the state had failed to prove its allegation that children lacking "biologically connected" gender role models face difficulties in psychological development. The appeals court will hear the case in a few months.

<p><u>DeBoer v. Michigan</u> began as a lawsuit to challenge a state law barring unmarried couples from adopting when April DeBoer and her partner Jayne Rowse sought to adopt three children they had been raising together. During arguments last year, Friedman suggested the plaintiffs amend their lawsuit to challenge Michigan's same-sex marriage ban. <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most hotly debated topics in the US legal community today. The <a href="www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed two lawsuits in March challenging same-sex marriage bans in <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-challenges-indiana-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier in March, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.tnmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee</a> [official website] granted a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-orders-tennessee-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages-pending-lawsuit.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] ordering the state of Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state until the lawsuit challenging the ban can be heard. A week prior, four couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Wyoming state court challenging that state's ban on same-sex marriage. Last year the US Supreme Court struck down part of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">US v.

The ban on Twitter was <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/turkey-pm-bans-twitter.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] last week under orders from Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Erdogan">news archive</a>] on the grounds that the social media site had failed to remove allegations of government corruption from the site. Materials that he wanted removed included leaked <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XikJkZ8XWoo">audio recordings</a> [recordings, in Turkish] of a voice, resembling Erdogan's, instructng his son to dispose of large amounts of money during a police search. Turkey's <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/en/About/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website], the nation's highest court, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/03/turkish-twitter-ban-20143261041967793.html">is expected</a> [Al Jazeera report] to further investigate the ban.

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world and has garnered attention over the past few years. Last month, Turkish President <a href="http://www.tccb.gov.tr/pages/">Abdullah Gul</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-president-approves-controversial-internet-bill.php">approved legislation that heightened Internet restrictions</a> [JURIST report] by granting the country's telecommunications authority the ability to block websites or remove content without a court's approval. Last year a Canadian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">unveiled research</a> [JURIST report] indicating that a number of nations are using American-made Internet surveillance technology which could be used to censor content and track their citizens. In 2012, the UN Human Rights Council passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect free Internet speech</a> [JURIST report], which was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Castleman</a> [opinion, PDF; SCOTUSblog <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-castleman/">backgrounder</a>] that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000922----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &#167; 922(g)(9), text] banning gun possession after a state domestic abuse conviction involving "physical force" can be satisfied by the degree of force supporting a common law battery conviction, namely, "offensive touching." In 2001, James Alvin Castleman pleaded guilty to a Tennessee misdemeanor of having "intentionally or knowingly cause[d] bodily injury to" the mother of his child. The federal government thereafter caught Castleman with a gun, and a grand jury indicted him under the federal gun possession law. Castleman moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing the federal law's definition of "physical force" was narrower in scope than the state law's definition of "bodily injury." In reversing a <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] decision, the Supreme Court found unanimously that Castleman's state domestic abuse conviction fit within the federal law's definition of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence." The court reasoned that Castleman's knowing or intentional causation of bodily injury necessarily involved the use of "physical force," which Congress meant to encompass the "well-settled" meaning and scope of common-law battery.

<p>The Supreme Court has issued decisions with respect to this specific federal gun possession law, the Armed Career Criminals Act (ACCA), in the past. In February 2009 court <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-decides-gun-possession.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 7-2 in <u>United States v. Hayes</u> that the federal gun law does not require that a domestic relationship between an attacker and victim be a specific element of the crime in order for it to apply. In January 2009 the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-rules-failure-to-report.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <u>Chambers v. United States</u> that failure to report to prison does not constitute a "violent felony" for purposes of sentence enhancement under the federal gun law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The OHCHR reportedly takes issue with the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47423#.UzLxKNx1Ng0">court's failure</a> [UN News Centre report] to offer more than perfunctory procedural protections, in violation of international law. The verdicts, which came after only two sessions, are subject to appeal. Experts suggest that the harshness of the rulings illustrates the lengths to which Egypt's courts have been politicized and due process has been ignored during a crackdown on Morsi's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] supporters following the president's removal in a military coup last July. During the first of the two trial sessions in Minya, the judge rejected requests by defense lawyers for more time to review trial documents for the defendants, leading to furious arguments. Defense lawyers were barred by security forces from the second session on Monday when verdicts and sentences were read.

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Much of that conflict has occurred recently between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his ouster in July 2013, especially since the organization's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">formal ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. On March 18, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-sentences-police-officers-for-deaths-of-37-islamists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four police officers for their role in the deaths of 37 Islamists. Opponents have criticized the light sentences handed down to the officers. A day earlier, an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/morsis-son-referred-to-trial-for-drug-possession.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] Morsi's youngest son, Abdullah Morsi, to trial on allegations of drug use and possession. In February, the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-convicts-alleged-terrorist-group.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 26 people of forming a terrorist group with intent to attack the Suez Canal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-354_5436.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] Tuesday on whether companies have a right to an exemption from the contraception provision of the 2010 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] for religious reasons. The plaintiffs in the combined cases of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Inc</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/conestoga-wood-specialties-corp-v-sebelius/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders] contend they should be exempt from some of the coverage requirements of the PPACA's pregnancy-related services mandate, including certain "abortifacient" contraceptives. Paul D. Clement, who represents the two corporations, argued that the regulation will impose a "substantial burden" on the corporations' exercise of religion, which is protected by the 1993 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text]. Alternatively, the corporations have asserted a claim that the mandate violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The Supreme Court must decide whether corporations can "exercise" religion under the RFRA. Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor suggested that if corporations are exempt from having to provide birth control services due to their exercise of religion, the door could open for corporations to also refuse to fund vaccinations, blood transfusions, or even pay minimum wage for religious reasons. Clement responded, however, that each of those cases would have to be analyzed on their own based on the circumstances and applicable constitutional standards.

<p>Solicitor General Verrilli, arguing on behalf of the government, said that the Court has never found a right to exercise religion for corporations, and tried to emphasize the rights of the employees who would be denied the best contraceptive coverage for them. Justice Kennedy, however, pressed Verrilli on the rights of the shareholders: "Under your view, a profit corporation could be forced in principle to pay for abortions. &#8230; You say profit corporations just don't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners." The decision is expected to be split four to four, and will likely be determined based on with which side Justice Kennedy, whose comments seemed to favor both the government and the employers, ultimately agrees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In his remarks on Venezuela's state run broadcast, Maduro <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/25/world/americas/venezuela-generals-coup/">stated</a> [CNN report] that the three generals, who he did not name, were "trying to turn the air force against the legitimately constituted government." Additionally, he stated that the generals had direct ties with opposition groups in Venezuela. Since taking office in April 2013, Maduro has <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-accuses-generals-plotting-coup">routinely accused his political opponents</a> [Guardian report] of plotting coups, but he seldom provides evidence or gives the public details. <a href="http://www.wola.org/people/david_smilde">David Smilde</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.wola.org/">Washington Office on Latin America</a> (WOLA) [official website] says that the arrests do not necessarily mean that Maduro is losing ground with the military and that he may be publicizing the coup in order to "emphasise the need for unity."

<p>Earlier this month a group of independent experts from the UN asked Venezuela to <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/un-experts-call-for-answer-on-violence-in-venezuela.php">explain allegations</a> [JURIST report] of arbitrary detention and excessive force against journalists and demonstrators during the country's recent protests. One week earlier UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-venezuela.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the recent political violence in Venezuela and urged all parties to move towards resolving the situation. The <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-office-calls-for-peaceful-resolution-of-venezuela-protests.php">violent demonstrations</a> [JURIST report] are partially a result of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25745959">economic difficulties</a> [BBC report] and disdain towards Maduro. In September Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/venezuela-withrdraws-from-international-human-rights-court.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights despite criticism from activists. In August the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/venezuela-supreme-court-dismisses-presidential-election-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by presidential candidate Henrique Capriles challenging the results of the presidential election that placed Maduro as the successor to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Iraq's parliament and judiciary have <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26733772">provided conflicting interpretations</a> [BBC report] of Clause 3 of Article 8 of Iraq's Electoral Law, which in part bars candidates "of ill repute."

HRW has taken action by writing letters to EU top officials Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy asking them to use the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/131181.pdf">European Union Stategic Framework</a> [text, PDF] to help raise awareness of human rights issues under President Xi's administration.  Specific rights HRW is looking for the EU to advocate to China are <a href="/hotline/2014/02/maya-wang-rhetoric-v-reality.php">freedom of association, expression, and assembly</a> [JURIST op-ed].  While advocating for these rights, HRW would also like the EU to ask Xi to release all the imprisoned citizens who have peacefully fought and addressed the human rights issues in China. Lotte Leicht, the EU director at Human Rights Watch, has responded to this issue by stating that "[t]he means of doing so are right there in the EU's own plans&#8212;but the EU's senior officials keep ducking this obligation with China, and in doing so, weakening their position." While top officials have not responded to the lack of support for human rights issues in China, HRW is optimistic of possible action by the EU with lower officials like High Representative Catherine Ashton speaking out against the death of China rights advocate Cao Shunli.  

<p>Human rights have been a controversial issue in China in recent years, along with accusations of corruption within the Chinese government. In December Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/hrw-urges-china-to-drop-charges-against-rights-activist.php">urged the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] to drop all politically motivated charges against human rights activist Xu Zhiyong and release him from prison. In August Chinese writer, lawyer and human rights advocate Yang Maodong became the second leader of the New Citizens movement to be <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/china-authorities-detain-human-rights-advocate.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report], following Xu, on suspicion of disrupting the peace. In June a Chinese court in Huairou sentenced [JURIST report] Liu Hui, brother-in-law of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, to 11 years in prison on charges of fraud. In May China's Nanjing Intermediate People's Court<a href="/paperchase/2013/05/former-chinese-official-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-accepting-bribes.php"> issued a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] to Huang Sheng, the former provincial deputy governor of Shandong Province, for accepting almost $2 million in bribes form 21 organizations and numerous individuals between 1998 and 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Patricia Parrish <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/oklahoma-judge-tosses-state-execution-law/2014/03/26/2e6d508a-b4fe-11e3-bab2-b9602293021d_story.html">found</a> [AP report] that the Oklahoma law, which keeps the identities of lethal-injection drugs suppliers secret and prevents the information from being revealed in court, is a violation of an inmate's due process right. Death row inmates Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner challenged the Oklahoma law out of concern that the approved lethal injection protocol would immobilize them without masking the pain of the execution. The announcement of Lockett and Warner's court challenge led to a shortage of the states standard execution drugs prompting Oklahoma's prison system <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/oklahoma-adds-options-execution-protocol">to adopt</a> [AP report] five acceptable ways to put death row inmates to death. 

<p>The shortage of commonly used <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a> [JURIST news archive] drugs in the US has forced a number of states to modify their execution drug protocols. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.okcca.net/">Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/oklahoma-court-delays-executions-due-to-lethal-injection-drug-shortage.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Lockett and Warner executions scheduled for March 20 and March 27, respectively, must be delayed for at least a month so that the state may have additional time to either procure the appropriate execution drugs or to alter the state's execution protocol. In February Judge <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=1265&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Terence Kern</a> [official profile] for the <a href="http://www.oknd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/federal-judge-orders-restraining-order-on-pharamacy-providing-lethal-injection-drugs.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a temporary restraining order on <a href="http://www.apothecarytulsa.com/index.asp">The Apothecary Shoppe in Tulsa</a> [corporate website] to stop the pharmacy from providing an execution drug to the Missouri <a href="http://doc.mo.gov/">Department of Corrections</a> [official website] for an upcoming lethal injection. In February the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Supreme Court of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/georgia-supreme-court-to-rule-on-challenge-to-execution-drug-secrecy-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of a law allowing the state to withhold the identities of the manufacturers of Georgia's lethal injection drugs. Also in February, the Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2014/02/florida-high-court-orders-a-review-of-new-lethal-injection-drug.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] an evidentiary hearing to determine if the sedative midazolam should remain in the state's lethal injection procedure. A month earlier, the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] refused to halt the execution of a convicted murderer Dennis McGuire, who was scheduled to die through the administration of a never-before-tried drug protocol due to the unavailability of the state's standard drug.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The rights organization recorded that executions took place in 22 countries in 2013, an increase by one from 2012. Neither the 2012 or 2013 report included Egypt or Syria as AI could not confirm if judicial executions took place. According to AI 778 reported executions took place in 2013, a 15 percent increase from 2012. The report acknowledges however that "excluding China, almost 80% of all known executions worldwide were recorded in only three countries: Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia." The number of executions does not include executions carried out in China, where AI estimates thousands were executed by the state; however such statistics are treated as a state secret, preventing the organization from obtaining reliable information. The report indicates that despite the increase in executions the global trend towards the elimination of the death penalty has continued. By the end of 2013 the number of countries that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes reached 98 a thirteen country increase over the last ten years. AI reports that the number of executions in the United States decreased in 2013 and Maryland became the eighteenth state to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/maryland-governor-signs-bill-repealing-death-penalty.php">abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Earlier this month China's legislature, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=npc">National People's Congress</a> (NPC) [JURIST news archive], <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/china-considering-limiting-use-of-death-penalty.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] measures that would subject less crimes to capital punishment if passed. In February a group of UN independent experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-experts-alarmed-at-spike-in-executions-in-iran.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the government of Iran to halt the startling increase in the number of hangings since the start of 2014. According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OFCHR) [official website], at least 40 persons were hanged in the beginning of January 2014, and 625 executions were reportedly carried out in 2013. Also in February Washington state <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Jay Inslee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/washington-governor-announces-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">announced a moratorium on executions</a> [JURIST report] in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Indiana <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2014/03/26/pence-signs-bill-allow-guns-school-parking-lots/6929307/">Governor Mike Pence</a> [official website] signed into law <a href="http://iga.in.gov/legislative/2014/bills/house/1048/">HB 1048</a> [legislative materials] on Wednesday, allowing adults to carry a concealed weapon locked in vehicles on school property. The current law in Indiana makes it a felony for any gun permit holder to have a firearm in their car while they are on school property. A spokesperson for the governor said the <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/education/2014/03/26/pence-signs-bill-allow-guns-school-parking-lots/6929307/">aim of the bill</a> [<em>Indy Star</em> report] is to allow parents to keep locked guns in their vehicles while they drop their children off at school or attend school events. The <a href="http://home.nra.org/home">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] supported the bill, arguing that it is necessary to protect <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. The <a href="http://www.iapss-in.org/">Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents</a> [official website] opposed the bill stating that school safety should be the primary concern and questioned if lawmakers will take responsibility if a shooting occurs as a result. The lawmakers responded that guns are still outlawed in school buildings. 

<p>Following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a number of states enacted restrictive gun control laws, many of which have been litigated in federal court. In January a federal district court in Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the constitutionality of the state's new <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">gun control law</a> [JURIST report].

Muiznieks <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rights-groups-slam-proposed-greek-law-migrants-23061792">expressed serious concern</a> [AP report] about the amendment's effect on reporting of abuses, saying that it would "foster impunity, since, most likely, migrants will avoid reporting instances of ill-treatment." Muiznieks was joined in his disapproval by<a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home"> Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and Greece's <a href="http://www.unhcr.gr/1againstracism/category/racist-violence-recording-network/">Racist Violence Recording Network</a> [advocacy website, in Greek] who also said that the amendment would discourage victims from reporting abuse for fear of deportation. Greek <a href="http://www.ypes.gr/el/Ministry/leadership/Michelakis/">Interior Minister Yiannis Michelakis</a> [official website, in Greek] has stated his support for the amendment, which he says is necessary to protect police and coast guard officials from false claims of abuse. The amendment was repeatedly submitted and withdrawn during parliamentary sessions last week and voting on the bill was delayed. It is expected to be brought before the <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr">Hellenic Parliament</a> [official website, in Greek] again this week. Muiznieks has previously expressed concern over Greece's reported <a href="http://www.coe.int/web/commissioner/-/greece-must-end-collective-expulsions?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coe.int%2Fweb%2Fcommissioner%2Fcountry-report%2Fgreece%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_aYpyViQY9KMa%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_count%3D1#aYpyViQY9KMa">collective expulsions</a> [statement] of migrants, "including a large number of Syrians fleeing war violence." 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=greece">Greece </a>[JURIST news archive] has experienced continuous turmoil during its ongoing financial crisis. In October a Greek court found former defense minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos<a href="/paperchase/2013/10/greece-court-finds-former-defense-minister-guilty-of-corruption.php"> guilty of money laundering</a> [JURIST report]. In May, a UN expert warned that Greece's bailout measures may <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-warns-greece-bailout-measures-compromising-human-rights.php">compromise human rights</a> [JURIST report] by severely undercutting the ability of Greek citizens to obtain a standard of living in line with international human rights standards. In January, Greece's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/greece-parliament-approves-new-tax-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new tax legislation to allow it to pay back its loans. Last October, the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/council-of-europe-rules-against-greece-labor-reform-measures.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that two labor reforms adopted by Greece as part of wider efforts to curb the nation's financial crises were illegal. The Council's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eurozone-greece-court-idUSBRE89H1M420121018">non-binding ruling</a> [Reuters report] concerned two measures passed by the Greek government in 2010 at the urging of the country's international creditors.

The <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/this_week/pdf/11-3235.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday that the Kansas legislature can withhold federal funding for two <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center/centerDetails.asp?f=3359&a=91470&v=details&gclid=COfxiN6Hs70CFeMSOgodlyUAbw#!service=abortion">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] clinics. In the original lawsuit, Planned Parenthood challenged a state law that stripped Planned Parenthood of funding under Title X because the group provides abortion services. US District Court Judge <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/j-thomas-marten/">Thomas Marten</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-law-defunding-of-planned-parenthood.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the enforcement of the state law in 2011, finding it to be unconstitutional. The appeals court reversed the district court's decision, holding that the legislation does not restrict the rights of speech or association through the allocation of funds and that the motivation behind the legislation is irrelevant. The court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ruling-kansas-strip-planned-parenthood-funds-23055378">overturned the ruling in a 2-1 vote</a> [AP report], so the decision will likely be appealed to the full court for a hearing. 

<p>Abortion continues to be a hot-button legal, political and moral issue within the ongoing debate over <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. A number of states have proposed laws to make abortions illegal after 20 weeks. Earlier this month the West Virginia legislature <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/west-virginia-lawmakers-approve-20-week-abortion-ban.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prohibit abortions later than 20 weeks after conception. In February the Mississippi House of Representative also <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/-the-mississippi-house-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 20-week abortion ban. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined to rule</a> on Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week ban on abortions after it was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] on constitutional grounds by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit last May. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a federal law banning 20-week abortions in June, but the bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/sen-lindsey-graham-introduces-abortion-bill/">failed</a> [WP report] to gain widespread support in the Democratic-controlled US Senate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order also reiterated that Musharraf <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2014-03/27/c_133219208.htm">would be arrested</a> [Xinhua report] if he failed to appear at his trial, and a non-bailable arrest warrant has been issued by the court for the former president. Petitions against the warrant were dismissed. While reports have stated that Justice Faisal Arab has left the three-member special court following claims by Musharraf's defense team that he is not impartial, the court has made clear that the judge had left for one day only.  Musharraf's lawyers have also raised objections regarding the appointment of special prosecutor <a href="http://www.arynews.tv/en/musharraf-treason-case-akram-shaikh-appointed-prosecutor/">Akram Shaikh</a> [ARY News backgrounder], who insisted on the non-bailable warrant.

<p>Musharraf has faced a variety of legal troubles since his return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile. Earlier this month a Pakistani court<a href="/paperchase/2014/03/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-musharraf.php"> issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for the former president in the event that he fails to attend the next court hearing on March 31, also directing the government to ensure Musharraf's safety when he travels to court. Also this month, Musharraf<a href="/paperchase/2014/03/musharraf-appeals-denial-of-military-court-trial.php"> filed an appeal </a>[JURIST report] to the Supreme Court challenging the decision not to allow Musharraf's high treason charge to be tried in military court. He made his<a href="/paperchase/2014/02/musharraf-makes-first-appearance-in-pakistan-court.php"> first appearance</a> [JURIST report] in front of the court in February. He had sought to delay his appearance for medical reasons and requested his travel ban be lifted to go abroad to seek medical treatment, a request the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-denies-musharraf-request-to-go-abroad-for-medical-treatment---dnp.php">denied </a>[JURIST report] on January 31, instead issuing a "bailable" arrest warrant. Earlier in January the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">rejected </a>[JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that he was too sick to attend proceedings scheduled for January 16 and ordered him to appear, though he ultimately did not do so. Also currently ongoing are proceedings related to Musharraf's involvement in the 2007 Red Mosque killings and the death of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto </a>[BBC obituary; JURIST<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto"> news archive</a>]. Musharraf has also been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of Bhutto. Bhutto was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/pakistan.bhutto/index.html">killed at a rally</a> [CNN report] addressing a large crowd of her supporters when a bomb exploded near her vehicle. Bhutto's death came just two weeks after a failed assassination attempt, and prosecutors have accused Musharraf of failing to provide adequate security protection for her. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested </a>[JURIST report] in October for his role in the Red Mosque massacre after nearly six months of house arrest for the charges relating to the death of Bhutto, for which he was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged </a>[JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its finding, the NLRB used the "right to control" test, which considers a variety of factors in determining the level of control an employer has over an alleged employee. First, the board found that "grant-in-aid scholarship football players perform services for the benefit of the Employer for which they receive compensation." Next, the board found that the players were under strict control by their employer, stating that "grant-in-aid scholarship players are subject to the Employer's control" in the performance of their duties as football players. Finally, the court found that the players are employees under the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text], stating that "the Employer's football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within the Act's broad definition of 'employee' when one considers the common law definition of 'employee'." Although this decision is a huge step forward for the students seeking unionization, the case is far from over, as the university will likely appeal soon. If the athletes are successful in forming a union, it would be the first player union in the history of the <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/">NCAA</a> [official website] and pre-NCAA college athletics. The ruling could also have massive implications for college athletes around the nation. 

<p>The ruling could potentially turn into a landmark decision, as it deviates from precedents of past cases involving the status of college students as employees of universities. One such critical case, which this ruling discusses, is <a href="http://blogs.kentlaw.iit.edu/faculty/files/2014/02/34242.doc_.pdf">Brown University</a> [report, pdf], an NLRB case from 2004 that questioned whether graduate student teaching assistants were employees of the university. The board distinguished Brown, stating that the football player's duties were completely unrelated to their academic studies, while the teaching assistants' duties in Brown were related. Similarly, in <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108shrg96674/html/CHRG-108shrg96674.htm">Boston Medical Center</a> [materials], the board found that an employer's interns, residents, and fellows were indeed employees because they had already completed and received their academic degrees.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeals court found that the district court had gone too far in declaring the statute "facially invalid," saying that such a classification should apply only when there could be no possible constitutional application of the law. As to the substantive due process claim, the court held that the proper standard of review is whether the state has a "rational basis" to act, and does not place an "undue burden" on the right of a woman to end a pregnancy prior to viability. The court rejected Planned Parenthood's suggestion that the standard be bifurcated due to the fact that the admitting privileges provision protects the health of the mother not the fetus, saying that the distinction had no basis in any legal precedent. This decision has been <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-appeals-court-upholds-texas-abortion-rules-23089845">praised</a> [AP report] by conservatives and many anti-abortion activists, but pro-choice advocates have characterized it as a substantial step backward that has already forced many abortion providers in the state to close, and many fear that even more clinics will be forced to close when other provisions of the law begin to take effect later this year.

<p>The final outcome of the challenge to the Texas abortion law is a matter of great importance to both sides of the abortion debate, and to the practical <a href="/dateline/2014/01/abbey-marr-texas-abortion.php">prospects</a> [JURIST op-ed] of the procedure's continued availability within the state. The Fifth Circuit began <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/fifth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">hearing oral arguments</a> in the case near the beginning of January, after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/supreme-court-allows-texas-abortion-law-to-remain-in-effect.php">upheld</a> [JURIST reports] its order vacating the injunction on enforcement of the law that had been granted by the district court. The Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-abortion-restrictions-to-take-effect.php">granted</a> a motion staying the injunction in November, just days after the district court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/federal-judge-strikes-down-restrictive-texas-abortion-law.php">declared</a> [JURIST reports] the law unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/aclu-planned-parenthood-challenge-texas-abortion-law.php">filed</a> their lawsuit challenging the law in September, shortly after the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/texas-senate-passes-abortion-bill--done.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] in July and signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution calls upon all UN states, international organizations and specialty agencies not to recognize any change in status of the Crimean region despite the <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/crimea-parliament-declares-independence-following-referendum.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report]. The UN gained broad support for the resolution as 100 states voted in favor, outnumbering the 11 votes against and 58 abstentions. The US Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/c58902.htm">Samantha Power</a> [official website] stated in regards to the vote that "the draft resolution was about only one issue: affirming a commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine." The Russian Federation representative asked the UN to respect the voluntary choice made by Crimea and not refuse their right to self determination. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/">Crimean annexation</a> [JURIST feature] has been a heavily disputed topic within international affairs. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">conflict</a> [BBC timeline] in Ukraine has reinvigorated fears of Cold War Era politics and increased tension between Russia and the West.

The statement is in accordance with Holder's initial <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/9201421014257314255.pdf">statement</a> [text] that the Department of Justice (DOJ) will be extending all federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married according to state law following the decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>]. Same-sex couples were granted marriage rights in Michigan after a federal judge's <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/Federal-judge-declares-Michigan-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/collections/4455287/DeBoer-v-Snyder-Michigan-Trial-Transcripts">DeBoer v. Michigan</a> [materials] <a href="http://www.equalitymi.org/files/March2014-DeBoer-ruling.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage. The state is currently appealing the decision, and <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder">Governor Rick Snyder</a> [official website] has said the marriages will not be recognized while a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/jurist-4.php">stay put in place by the appeals court</a> [JURIST report] is in effect. Holder said:<blockquote>I have determined that the same-sex marriages performed last Saturday in Michigan will be recognized by the federal government. These families will be eligible for all relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same-sex marriages. The Governor of Michigan has made clear that the marriages that took place on Saturday were lawful and valid when entered into, although Michigan will not extend state rights and benefits tied to these marriages pending further legal proceedings.</blockquote>This means that couples married between the lower court's order and the stay put in place by the appeals court will not have to wait to receive federal recognition. The appeals court is expected to hear the case in a few months.

<p><span class="casename">DeBoer v. Michigan</span> began as a lawsuit to challenge a state law barring unmarried couples from adopting when April DeBoer and her partner Jayne Rowse sought to adopt three children they had been raising together. During arguments last year, Friedman suggested the plaintiffs amend their lawsuit to challenge Michigan's same-sex marriage ban. <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is one of the most hotly debated topics in the US legal community today. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed two lawsuits in March challenging same-sex marriage bans in <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-challenges-indiana-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-floridas-refusal-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier in March a judge for the <a href="http://www.tnmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee</a> [official website] granted a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-orders-tennessee-to-recognize-same-sex-marriages-pending-lawsuit.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] ordering the state of Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages performed out-of-state until the lawsuit challenging the ban can be heard. A week prior, four couples <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/four-same-sex-couples-filed-a.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Wyoming state court challenging that state's ban on same-sex marriage. Last year the US Supreme Court struck down part of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] in US v.

Sanitation worker Sawan Masih, whose argument with a friend set off a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/world/asia/explosion-rips-through-mosque-in-peshawar-pakistan.html">riot</a> [NYT report] in which an angered Muslim crowd set fire to a Christian town last March, is to be hanged after being found guilty of insulting the prophet Mohammed. Pakistan has yet to execute anyone on death row under its <a href="http://www.pakistanlaw.net/pakistan-law/blasphemy-laws-pakistan/">blasphemy laws</a> [text, PDF]. Masih's lawyer stated that the case would be appealed to the Lahore High Court, which has to give the final go ahead on executions. According to a recent US report, Pakistan <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1092919/blasphemy-law-use-on-rise-led-by-pakistan-us-group">remains</a> [AFP report] number one in the world by a large margin in terms of countries that use blasphemy laws essentially to persecute those with opposing religious views.

<p>There have been many incidents involving Pakistan's highly contentious blasphemy laws in recent years. In January a court in Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-sentences-man-to-death-for-claiming-to-be-a-prophet.php">sentenced a man to death</a> [JURIST report] for being found to have written letters claiming to be a prophet. In August of last year a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-dismisses-charges-again-cleric-in-blasphemy-case.php">dismissed charges</a> [JURIST report] against a cleric who was arrested for allegedly framing a Christian girl accused of blasphemy. In April of last year the Lahore High Court in Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-overturns-blasphemy-conviction-of-man-on-death-row.php">acquitted a Christian man</a> [JURIST report] sentenced to death for blasphemy. In November 2012 a Pakistani court ordered police to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/pakistan-court-drops-blasphemy-charges-against-christian-girl.php">drop blasphemy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a 14-year-old Christian girl, which sparked international concern over the use of the country's controversial law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, writers and video producers, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/27/us-baidu-china-lawsuit-idUSBREA2Q1VS20140327">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that the search engine prevents users in the US from viewing their materials advocating greater democracy in China, in violation of their First Amendment free speech rights and claimed $16 million in damages. District Judge Jesse Furman determined instead that the processes used by Baidu are protected by the First Amendment, prompting criticism by plaintiffs' lawyers who reportedly <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/chinas-biggest-internet-company-baidu-wins-us-censorship-lawsuit-1564120">stated</a> [IBT report] that court created a legal paradox. Furman compared Baidu's filtering to the "editorial judgment" of a newspaper editor and said that Baidu has equal rights to promote systems of government other than democracy just as the plaintiffs have the right to promote democracy. Baidu is the largest search engine in China since Google stopped operating there, and it has the fifth-most web traffic of any website on the planet.

<p>Government Internet censorship has been an area of global concern for many years, in January 2013 the Canadian human rights group Citizen Lab <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a report revealing that many nations use American technology to monitor and censor web content and traffic within the countries. The Chinese government is considered one of the heaviest censors of Internet activity and has repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/china-government-defends-internet-censorship-laws.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its position on the matter. In March 2010 Google <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/google-stops-censoring-china-search.php">ceased</a> [JURIST report] complying with Chinese censorship requirements and subsequently pulled its services from the country. In 2007 Google <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/google-urges-us-government-to-treat.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] US government bodies, including the Departments of State and Commerce to treat internet censorship as a barrier to trade as it restricts the free flow of information. In 2006 the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-internet-companies-criticized-for.php">admonished</a> [JURIST report] several Internet companies, including Yahoo!, Microsoft and Google for complying with China's harsh censorship laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Lawrence Karlton held that the <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-rules-two-california-laws-unconstitutional.php">laws were unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because they affected the punishment for crimes committed before the laws were enacted. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/victimservices/content/bill_of_rights">Marsy's Law</a> [text], otherwise known as the "Victims' Bill of Rights," was passed in 2008, mandating that inmates serve longer periods of time between parole hearings. Meanwhile, <a href="http://repository.uchastings.edu/ca_ballot_props/1006/">Proposition 89</a> [text], entitled the "Governor's Parole Review," was passed in 1988 to allow the governor to reverse approved paroles in murder cases. The attorney general's office <a href="http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/mar/27/california-appeals-ruling-on-2-voter-approved-laws/">filed a notice of appeal</a> [AP report] with the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>This is the most recent case in a changing environment of sentencing guidelines. Last month New York announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/new-york-agrees-to-reform-solitary-confinement-law.php">reform sentencing</a> [JURIST report] in a way that would reduce the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=solitary+confinement">solitary confinement</a> [JURIST news archive] and ban solitary confinement for prisoners under 18 years old. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-rules-on-mandatory-sentencing-for-drug-dealers.php">relaxed sentencing guidelines</a> [JURIST report] for drug dealers. In October three companies behind private juvenile detention and treatment facilities involved in a northeastern Pennsylvania <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sentencing+scandal">juvenile justice scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/pennsylvania-detention-facilities-settle-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal-lawsuit.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a civil lawsuit for $2.5 million. In June the US Supreme Court limited the way sentencing courts can use <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-2.php">prior convictions to enhance sentencing</a> [JURIST report] for federal crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/28/us-un-rights-drones-idUSBREA2R0WW20140328">resolution was presented by</a> [Reuters report] Switzerland and Pakistan and expressed concern over global compliance with international law in the use of armed drone strikes and the increased rates of civilian casualties resulting from them. The GA set out the need for greater transparency in the use of drones. This comes just one day after a UN rights panel <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/us-human-rights-record-chastised-un-report">called upon</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the US to decrease its use of drones and justify military drone strikes. While the GA resolution does not single out any particular nation, the US conducts more drone strikes than any other nation. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/drones/">Drone use</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue both in terms of small domestic drones and larger drones being used abroad by the US military. In October UN experts urged the international community to have <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-accountability-transparency-in-use-of-drones.php">greater accountability</a> [JURIST report] and transparency when it comes to the use of drones. A week earlier the UN released a report showing that the US had <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-report-claims-us-drone-strikes-have-killed-more-than-publicly-stated.php">killed more people</a> [JURIST report] using drone strikes than it publicly claimed to have killed. A month earlier the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/fbi-use-of-unmanned-drones-revealed.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing its plans for the use of unmanned drones in future missions. In August, the UN stated that if the US is to use drones they <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-sg-us-drone-strikes-must-comply-with-international-law.php">must comply</a> [JURIST report] with international law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/europe/senate-approves-1-billion-in-aid-for-ukraine.html?_r=0">passed</a> [NYT report] by a vote of 98-2 in the Senate and 399-19 in the House. Despite the overwhelming support of the bill, Congress remains torn on how the government should confront Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website]. Some lawmakers from both parties called for more aggressive action, asking for sanctions on the banking and energy sector or increased military assistance to Ukraine. Others urged caution and argued that more action is unnecessary unless Russia moved farther into Ukraine or a neighboring country. Congress will have to reconcile the two similar bills before President Obama can sign the bill into law, which he has stated he plans to do so. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26248275">ongoing conflict</a> [BBC timeline] in Ukraine has reinvigorated fears of Cold War Era politics and increased tension between Russia and the West. The conflict in Ukraine followed a number of <a href="/dateline/2014/02/jurist-podcast-on-tensions-in-ukraine.php">protests</a> [JURIST podcast] over the suspension of negotiations on a long-expected trade deal between Ukraine and the EU. Last Friday, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/russia-finalizes-annexation-of-crimea.php">finalized</a> [JURIST report] the annexation of Crimea. On Thursday the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">Russian State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] voted nearly unanimously to approve Russia's annexation of Crimea despite threats of further sanctions from Western powers. Also last week Putin and representatives of Crimea <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/putin-signs-treaty-incorporating-crimea-into-russia.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] to incorporate Crimea into the Russian Federation. Earlier in March, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/obama-russia-military-intervention-in-ukraine-is-a-violation-of-international-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Russia's military intervention in the region as a violation of international law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a vote of 23-12, with 12 member states abstaining, the council resolved to "establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations" that took place during a decades-long <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47447&Cr=sri+lanka&Cr1=#.UzWYIxZCe2z">conflict</a> [UN News Centre report] between the Sri Lankan government and the <a href="http://www.eelam.com">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [official website]. The LTTE, a rebel <a href="http://www.cfr.org/separatist-terrorism/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">separatist group</a> [CFR backgrounder] that crusaded for an independent state for the Tamil people, was overcome by the Sri Lankan government in May 2009. The US-led UN resolution asserted that the plight in Sri Lanka "had continued to deteriorate" and included "enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, sexual violence, repression to human rights defenders and violence against religious minorities." The resolution's goals are aimed at "avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability" by both parties. 

<p>The UN resolution comes after many years of pleading from the international community to look into human rights atrocities that allegedly took place during and after the Sri Lankan civil war. In May 2009 a UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/un-sri-lanka-resolution-does-not.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] welcomed the conclusion of the war and condemned LTTE attacks on civilians but did not call for an investigation into purported war crimes. The following month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/sri-lanka-rights-violations-should-be.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] an international inquiry into human rights abuses during the war asserting that tens of thousands were killed resulting in relatively few prosecutions. More recently, in November 2013, UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/britain-pm-demands-independent-sri-lanka-rights-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report]  that Sri Lanka conduct an investigation into the alleged war crimes threatening an international investigation if the country did not comply. The US <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">followed up</a>  [JURIST report] in January when Stephen Rapp, the State Department's Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, called on Sri Lanka to investigate after Rapp spoke with eyewitnesses "about serious human rights abuses" that occurred at the end of the war."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The council approved the resolution, which expressed "Deep[] concern[] at the systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," by a vote of 30-6 with 11 abstentions. The resolution, originally brought by Japan, "Condemns in the strongest terms" the human rights violations. North Korean ambassador So Se Pyong responded "In the DPRK, we have a proverb saying 'Mind your own business'." The resolution also extends the mandate of its human rights investigator in North Korea by a year.

<p>The resolution based its call to action on the findings of the UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human Rights in North Korea which <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/north-korea-atrocities-on-par-with-nazism-khmer-rouge-un-rights-expert.php">compared the alleged abuses</a> [JURIST report] to those of Nazism, apartheid and the Khmer Rouge.

Access to Twitter was suspended in Turkey last week by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Erdogan">news archive</a>] for the website's failure to remove allegations of government corruption. The specific account that was ordered to be removed accuses former Transport Minister Binali Yildirim of corruption. Twitter <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkish-court-backs-twitter-but-site-still-blocked/2014/03/29/04eab7aa-b72b-11e3-9eb3-c254bdb4414d_story.html">called the decision</a> [AP report] a "win for freedom of expression." An Ankara court has already <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/turkey-court-orders-government-agency-to-lift-twitter-ban.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the government to drop the ban on Twitter entirely, but Turkish authorities have stated they have 30 days to comply with the order and plan to appeal.

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world and has garnered attention over the past few years. Turkish President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17992010">Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/turkish-president-approves-controversial-internet-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] in February tightening internet restrictions and allowing the government to block websites without court approval. In January 2013, a Canadian human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/governments-abusing-internet-surveillance-and-censorship-technologies-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that a number of nations are using American-made Internet surveillance technology to censor content and track citizens. China <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">adopted new restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in December 2012, requiring ISPs to monitor and report online content found to be illegal. In June 2012, the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] its first resolution to protect the free speech of individuals online.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from violence in Alexandria just after Morsi was ousted. Specifically, the two were convicted of killing Morsi opponents by throwing them off a building. Two of the youths suffered serious injuries while one was pronounced dead at the hospital. The sentences are part of a harsh crackdown on Morsi's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] supporters following the president's removal in a military coup last July. In addition to these death sentences, another Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-to-rule-on-mass-trial-of-Morsi-supporters.php">sentenced 529 Morsi supporters to death</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, despite heavy opposition from international human rights groups. 

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">2011 revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Much of that conflict has occurred recently between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his ouster in July, especially since the organization's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">formal ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. On March 18, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-sentences-police-officers-for-deaths-of-37-islamists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four police officers for their role in the deaths of 37 Islamists. Opponents have criticized the light sentences handed down to the officers. A day earlier, an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/morsis-son-referred-to-trial-for-drug-possession.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] Morsi's youngest son, Abdullah Morsi, to trial on allegations of drug use and possession. In February, the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-convicts-alleged-terrorist-group.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 26 people of forming a terrorist group with intent to attack the Suez Canal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House <a href="http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVa-Senate-Passes-Abortion-Limits-Bill-249165211.html">passed the bill</a> [AP report] by a vote of 85-15 with two delegates not participating. The bill passed the West Virginia Senate a few days earlier. West Virginia would have been the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/03/10/west-virginias-legislature-passes-a-20-week-abortion-ban/">first Democrat-controlled state</a> [WP report] to approve a 20-week ban on abortion. Tomblin noted in his statement that the veto was used because he was <blockquote>Advised, by not only attorneys from the legislature, but through my own legal team that this bill is unconstitutional. The bill is also problematic because it unduly restricts the physician-patient relationship. All patients, particularly expectant mothers, require the best, most unfettered medical judgment and advice from their physicians regarding treatment options. The medical community has made it clear to me that the criminal penalties this bill imposes will impede that advice, and those options, to the detriment of the health and safety of expectant mothers.</blockquote>The bill resembled an Arizona law that was struck down by a federal appeals court. Its overwhelming acceptance by both Democratically controlled legislative bodies sparked intense controversy among West Virginia democrats. 

<p>The debate over 20-week abortion bans is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. A number of states have proposed laws to make abortions illegal after 20-weeks and the US government has grappled with the constitutionality of a federal law banning abortion procedures 20 weeks after conception. In February the Mississippi House <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/-the-mississippi-house-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 20-week abortion ban law. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-law.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rule on Arizona's attempt to revive its 20-week ban on abortions after having been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">stuck down</a> [JURIST report] on constitutional grounds by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals last May. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a federal law banning 20-week abortions in June 2013 but the bill <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/11/07/sen-lindsey-graham-introduces-abortion-bill/">failed</a> [Washington Post report] to gain widespread support in the Democratic-controlled US Senate because many representatives believe such a law would violate women's rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Azhari served as deputy chairman of the parliamentary Manpower Committee in 2012, and he was named Minister of Manpower and Immigration in August of that year. In the trial, al-Azhari was sentenced alongside a fellow parliamentary member for harboring <a href="http://www.fjponline.com">Freedom and Justice Party</a> (FJP) [party website] Secretary General Mohamed Beltagy while there was warrant issued for his arrest for allegedly inciting deadly violence in the summer of 2013.

The Assembly voted unanimously in a special session to approve the law, which becomes valid within the next 90 days. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/29/us-cuba-investment-idUSBREA2S0EJ20140329">new law</a> [Reuters report] reduces the profits tax from 30 to 15 percent and exempts investors from paying that tax for eight years. Many of the incentives are reserved for joint ventures with the Cuban state and investment projects linking foreign companies with Cuban companies. Foreign companies will be able to maintain full ownership in joint ventures, but the incentives have been viewed with <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/29/cuba-foreign-investment-law/7050617/">skepticism</a> [USA Today report] from many nations. Cuba does not publish economic statistics on foreign direct investment, but economists approximate it to be on the order of several hundred million dollars annually.  

<p>The US amended its <a href="http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113">trade embargo</a> [CFR backgrounder] to allow US companies to export food and agricultural products to Cuba, but Cuba is largely cut off from US investment. However, experts have argued the six-years of leadership under <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12700491">Raul Castro</a> [BBC profile] has changed the structure of the Cuban economy. In 2011 Cuba enacted a 300-point overhaul of its domestic economy to spur private enterprise. Last November US President Barack Obama announced support for <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/global-affairs/americas/189774-obama-us-should-be-creative-and-thoughtful-in-cuba-policy">creative and thoughtful</a> [The Hill report] consideration regarding future relations with Cuba. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Milutin Graic, 41, was living in Roosendaal, near the Netherlands' border with Belgium. Graic is <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/28/uk-warcrimes-yugoslavia-dutch-idUKBREA2R1D320140328">accused</a> [Reuters report] of being a member of a militia that ethnically cleansed Croats by deporting them from the statelet of Serbian Krajina in the early 1990s. According to prosecutors, a Croatian court had issued a European arrest warrant for Graic. His extradition to Croatia is expected to follow soon. 

<p>Investigations of war crimes related to the Bosnian-Serbian conflict are still ongoing and suspects are still being arrested and prosecuted. Earlier this month, Croatia, at the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/croatia-accuses-serbia-of-genocide-before-international-court.php">accused Serbia of genocide</a> [JURIST report] in the 1990s. In January the appeals chamber for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/convicted-serbian-war-criminals-receive-reduced-sentences.php">upheld </a>[JURIST report] the criminal convictions of four Serbian senior officials stemming from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnia+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last September the ICTY allowed<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Momcilo+Krajisnik"> Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [JURIST news archive], the former speaker for the Bosnian Serb parliament, to return to Bosnia after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/former-head-of-bosnian-serb-parliament-released-from-prison.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report]. In August Danish judge Frederik Harhoff was <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/danish-judge-removed-from-war-crimes-tribunal-for-bias.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] from the ICTY over claims of bias in a letter he wrote criticizing the court. The ICTY was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_827_1993_en.pdf">created </a>[text, PDF] in 1993 by UN Resolution 827 to adjudicate the alleged war crimes perpetrated in the region of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The ICTY's term of prosecution has been extended until December 2014. Since its inception, the ICTY has convicted numerous war criminals for atrocities committed in the widespread violence of the Balkan region. The tribunal has been working through an immense caseload for the past 20 years and has recently delegated much of the war crime adjudication to the courts of individual Balkan nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was made in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/2014_March_Rwanda.pdf">briefing paper</a> [text, PDF] published to mark the twentieth anniversary of the genocide. HRW also urged the Rwandan government and the international community to pursue efforts to prosecute, "in fair and credible trials," other perpetrators who are still at large: "The Rwandan authorities should also bring to justice Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) members responsible for carrying out or ordering war crimes or crimes against humanity in 1994, and ensure that families of the victims of these crimes, as well as witnesses, are able to speak freely about these events without fear for their security." Finally, HRW urged Rwandan authorities to continue reforming its justice system "with a view to further strengthening its independence, and to enable those who suffered serious miscarriages of justice ... to seek a review of their cases within a reasonable period." 

<p>Many countries have attempted to assist the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] in locating and bringing to justice those responsible for war crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. Last month the ICTR announced that Augustin Ndindiliyimana, the former chief of staff of the Rwandan parliamentary police, and Francois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye, the former commander of a military reconnaissance battalion, had been <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-special-court-acquitts-2-rwandan-officers-in-1994-genocide.php">acquitted on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. In January UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association Maina Kiai <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/un-expert-praises-strides-in-rwanda-urges-protection-assembly-rights.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] Rwandan authorities' accomplishments in developing infrastructure and ensuring stability and security 1994. In November a French appeals court in Paris <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/france-appeals-court-approves-extradition-of-rwanda-genocide-suspects.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Claude Muhayimana and Innocent Musabyimana, two suspects wanted in connection with the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In April <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">French law enforcement officials arrested</a> [JURIST report] Tite Barahira, a former Rwandan leader, for conspiracy to commit genocide. In January Rwandan genocide suspect Innocent Musabyimana was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In December the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison and concluding the tribunal's final trial. Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. In July 2012 the ICTR Residual Mechanism <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42402&Cr=Criminal&Cr1=Tribunal#.UbixLI6nVgI">began its work</a> [UN News Centre report] assisting with the winding down of the ICTR and assuring that all remaining fugitives of the Rwandan genocide face justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israel's Tel Aviv District Court on Monday convicted former Israeli prime minister <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/3/Ehud%20Olmert">Ehud Olmert</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=olmert">news archive</a>] of accepting bribes relating to the construction of a luxury apartment complex called the Holyland towers. As Jerusalem's mayor from 1993 to 2003, Olmert, along with other city officials, allegedly accepted nearly 560,000 shekels (USD $150,000) in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/world/middleeast/former-israeli-leader-ehud-olmert-is-convicted-of-taking-bribes.html?_r=0">bribes</a> [NYT report] from developers to assure the approval of plans for Holyland, which dominates a Jerusalem hilltop and has attracted unrelenting criticism for its architecture. Specifically, the project's developers, who are also charged in the case, received zoning and tax breaks in return for the bribes. Olmert resigned as Israel's leader in September 2008, saying he wanted to clear his name, staying on as caretaker prime minister until March 2009 when Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in. Olmert was officially <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/israel-ex-pm-suspected-of-corruption-in.php">named as a suspect</a> [JURIST report] in the investigation in April 2010.</p>

<p>In July 2012 Olmert was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/israel-ex-pm-acquitted-of-major-corruption-charges-convicted-on-lesser-count.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of two major counts of corruption but found guilty of a third lesser charge in the culmination of a three-year trial. In a 700-page ruling three senior judges of a Jerusalem court rejected the prosecution's key accusations that as a cabinet minister and Jerusalem's mayor before becoming prime minister Olmert received bribes from US businessman Moshe Talansky, and that Olmert defrauded Israeli charities by double-billing them for overseas fundraising trips, a charge popularly referred to as the Rishon Tours double-billing affair. Olmert was convicted of breach of trust for granting illegal favors to a long-time friend and business partner while serving as minister of industry, trade and labor between 2002 and 2007. In September 2012 the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/israel-ex-pm-given-suspended-sentence-fine-for-breaching-public-trust.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Olmert to a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of about USD $19,000 for the charge of breaching public trust.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Monday sentenced 33 supporters of deposed president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] to six years in prison for protesting without government permission in December. The court also <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/egyptians-elect-president-late-23120263">fined</a> [AP report] each defendant 50,000 Egyptian pounds (approximately USD $7,100). The prison sentences are the latest in a series of crackdowns on Morsi's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [JURIST news archive] supporters following the president's removal in a military coup last July. In addition to these sentences, another Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-to-rule-on-mass-trial-of-Morsi-supporters.php">sentenced 529 Morsi supporters to death</a> [JURIST report] last week, despite heavy opposition from international human rights groups.</p>

<p>Political conflict in Egypt has been ongoing since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power. Much of that conflict has occurred recently between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and the former government of Morsi, and supporters of the new government in place since his ouster in July, especially since the organization's <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/egypt-court-bans-muslim-brotherhood.php">formal ban</a> [JURIST reports] in September. On March 18 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/egypt-court-sentences-police-officers-for-deaths-of-37-islamists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four police officers for their role in the deaths of 37 Islamists. Opponents have criticized the light sentences handed down to the officers. A day earlier, an Egyptian prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/morsis-son-referred-to-trial-for-drug-possession.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] Morsi's youngest son, Abdullah Morsi, to trial on allegations of drug use and possession. In February, the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/egypt-court-convicts-alleged-terrorist-group.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 26 people of forming a terrorist group with intent to attack the Suez Canal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ICJ: Japan must halt whaling program</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/148/18136.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Monday that Japan cannot continue its annual whale hunt, finding that it is not being carried out for the scientific purposes the Japanese government had claimed. This 12-4 decision was the result of a suit brought against Japan by Australia, which <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/japan-whaling-world-court_n_5061042.html">hoped to end</a> [AP report] the country's Antarctic whaling program. Australia argued that Japan is in violation of the <a href="http://iwc.int/private/downloads/1r2jdhu5xtuswws0ocw04wgcw/convention.pdf">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [text, PDF] by continuing to hunt whales despite a ban on commercial whaling by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/">International Whaling Commission</a> [official website]. ICJ <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/?p1=1&p2=2&p3=1&judge=15">President Judge Peter Tomka</a> [official profile] stated that the large size of the number of whales the program claimed to need for research and the fact that those numbers were rarely reached made the court doubt that the whaling was being carried out for scientific purposes. The court thus concluded that permits granted by Japan for whaling were not "for purposes of scientific research" and ordered Japan to stop issuing such permits until the program has been changed. </p>

<p>This case has been ongoing since June 2010, when the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Japan to seek an injunction against "scientific whaling" in the Southern Ocean. The complaint alleged that Japan had continued to pursue large-scale whaling under Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic ("JARPA II"), and had thus breached its "good faith" obligation to limit the killing of whales for commercial purposes to zero. Australia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/australia-lodges-complaint-against-japan-whaling-in-icj.php">filed a complaint with the ICJ</a> [JURIST report] against Japan for its whaling practices in May 2011. In November 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-zealand-joins-australia-in-japanese-whaling-legal-dispute.php">New Zealand announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would support Australia in its battle against Japanese whaling practices. Commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling Commission since 1986. In June 2013 the ICJ began public hearings on the ongoing legal dispute.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in Pakistan on Monday charged former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] with high treason. If convicted, the former leader could face the death penalty. Musharraf <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26815518">pleaded not guilty</a> [BBC report] to each of the charges against him, including unlawfully suspending the constitution, firing Pakistan's chief justice and instituting emergency rule in 2007. Musharraf called the charges politically motivated, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/31/world/asia/pakistan-pervez-musharraf-treason/">maintained that the country had prospered </a>[CNN report] under his 2001-2008 rule and insisting that his declaring a state of emergency was not unconstitutional. A <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/pakastani-court-to-frame-high-treason-charge-for-musharraf.php">court order</a> [JURIST report] regarding the framing of the formal high treason charges was made by a special court in Pakistan last week. The court on Monday also rejected Musharraf's application to allow him to leave the country to visit his sick mother in Dubai despite being under house arrest. The court stated that the authority to remove him from the country's exit control list lay with the government, not the court.  </p>

<p>Musharraf has faced a variety of legal troubles since his return to Pakistan from self-imposed exile. Earlier this month a Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-musharraf.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for the former president in the event that he fails to attend the next court hearing on March 31, also directing the government to ensure Musharraf's safety when he travels to court. Also this month, Musharraf <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/musharraf-appeals-denial-of-military-court-trial.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court challenging the decision not to allow Musharraf's high treason charge to be tried in military court. He made his <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/musharraf-makes-first-appearance-in-pakistan-court.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] in front of the court in February. He had sought to delay his appearance for medical reasons and requested his travel ban be lifted to go abroad to seek medical treatment, a request the court denied [JURIST report] on January 31, instead issuing a "bailable" arrest warrant. Earlier in January the court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/pakistan-court-demands-musharraf-attend-hearing-despite-medical-reports.php">rejected</a> JURIST report] Musharraf's contention that he was too sick to attend proceedings scheduled for January 16 and ordered him to appear, though he ultimately did not do so. Also currently ongoing are proceedings related to Musharraf's involvement in the 2007 Red Mosque killings and the death of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Musharraf has also been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation of murder in the 2007 death of Bhutto. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/former-pakistani-president-pervez-musharraf.php">arrested</a> in October for his role in the Red Mosque massacre after nearly six months of house arrest for the charges relating to the death of Bhutto, for which he was formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/pakistan-court-officially-charges-musharraf-in-assassination-of-benzair-bhutto.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Extremists and security forces are committing war crimes in northeastern Nigeria's Islamic uprising, resulting in at least 1,500 deaths this year alone, according to a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR44/004/2014/en/543f7ac9-6889-4f02-bf5a-d73832e04229/afr440042014en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] published Friday by <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. This number equals the total <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/2014/03/31/amnesty-nigerian-uprising-kills-this-year/AWWPdLwdDx8mXLUuWN2N0M/story.html">death count</a> [AP report] recorded between 2010 and June 2013, and the report estimated that approximately half of these deaths were civilians. The text details the conflict, elaborating on recent attacks and unlawful killings by the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Boko+Haram">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive]. The report also accuses Nigeria's security forces of reacting to the Boko Haram in ways that seriously conflict with human rights. Furthermore, the advocacy website chastises authorities for allowing impunity and failing to bring perpetrators to justice. The report urges Nigeria to respect the rights detailed in <a href="http://www.achpr.org/instruments/achpr/">African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [texts]. These texts, along with the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/ccpr/pages/ccprindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official websites], have established that human rights are still to be protected even in times of conflict. </p>

<p>Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government and create an Islamic state and has warned Christians in the mostly Muslim northern regions to leave the area. In February extremists gunned down numerous students in school, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/25/nigeria-school-killings/5802225/">burned down dormitories</a> [AP report] in the middle of the night after locking the students inside. Last May Nigerian <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Goodluck+Jonathan">President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [JURIST news archive] declared a state of emergency to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram. The group has publicly claimed responsibility for several attacks, including <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/25/us-nigeria-blast-idUSTRE7BO03020111225">church bombings</a> [Reuters report] on December 25 that killed approximately 40 people in 2011. In January 2012 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged Nigerian leaders from all sectors of society to make a concerted effort to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-urges-nigeria-leaders-to-halt-sectarian-violence.php">stop the sectarian violence</a> [JURIST report]. The Christmas day bombings were internationally condemned, including being labeled as <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/25/statement-press-secretary-nigeria">"senseless violence" by the White House</a> [press release] and <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/story/2011-12-25/world-christmas-pope-message/52222460/1">acts of "blind hatred" by the Vatican</a> [AP report]. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-concerned-over-renewed-violence-in-nigeria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over acts of ethnic violence by Boko Haram. Specifically, the Office described the group's <a href="http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/boko-haram-claims-nigeria-attack-128490388/130980.html">bombing of a UN building in Nigeria</a> [VOA report] in August 2011 as "cowardly." At least 18 people were killed in the attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-298_869d.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] on Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/alice-corporation-pty-ltd-v-cls-bank-international/">Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], which raises the issue of whether certain types of computer software are patent eligible under the Patent Act. Appearing on behalf of the government, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/meet-osg.html">US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli</a> [official profile] argued that the software in question is too abstract to be patent eligible. Alternatively, the attorney for Alice Corp argued that the software constitutes system and process patents, which are eligible under the Patent Act. However, the questions from the justices at oral argument <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-usa-court-ip-idUSBREA2U05X20140331">indicated</a> [Reuters report] that the court is likely to rule that the patents held by Alice Corp on computer software that helps facilitate financial transactions are not patent eligible. Additionally, the court is expected to issue a narrow ruling that does not drastically change existing patent law.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-software-patents.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] Alice Corps' <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AliceCorpPet.pdf">petition for <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF] in December. In May the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-software-may-not-be-patentable.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] the district court's ruling that the patents were not patent eligible. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/033114zor_dc8f.pdf">denied review</a> [order list, PDF] of two cases brought by Roman Catholic non-profit groups seeking an exemption from part of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [materials; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] requiring employers to provide insurance coverage for contraception. Both cases, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-829.htm">Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v.  Sebelius</a> and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-891.htm">Priests for Life, v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [dockets], were seeking <em>certiorari</em> prior to decisions from the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website]. After the appellate court renders a decision, both petitioners could still petition for <em>certiorari</em> if they wish to appeal the cases further. Oral arguments in <span class="casename">Priests for Life v. HHS</span> are <a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/blog/index.php/supreme-court-declines-further-review-of-hhs-challenges-priests-for-life-lawsuit-in-d-c-circuit-continues">expected to occur</a> [Priests for Life press release] on May 8. </p>

<p>These cases differ from the current Supreme Court cases involving for-profits arguing against the <a href="/feature/featured/contraception-mandate/">contraception mandate</a> [JURIST backgrounder] because these cases involve religious non-profit organizations. In the for-profit cases, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-contraceptives-mandate.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] last week on whether companies have a right to an exemption from the contraception provision of the PPACA for religious reasons. The plaintiffs in the combined cases of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/conestoga-wood-specialties-corp-v-sebelius/">Conestoga Wood v. Sebelius</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders] contend they should be exempt from some of the coverage requirements of the PPACA's pregnancy-related services mandate, including certain "abortifacient" contraceptives. The corporations argue that the regulation will impose a "substantial burden" on the corporations' exercise of religion, which is protected by the 1993 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-21B">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text]. Alternatively, the corporations have asserted a claim that the mandate violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The Supreme Court must decide whether corporations can "exercise" religion under the RFRA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge Myron Thompson of the <a href="http://www.almd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama</a> [official website] announced on Monday that he would hold a trial on Alabama's new law requiring abortion clinic to have approval to admit patients to nearby hospitals. The <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/bills/hb57.htm">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-governor-signs-bill-strengthening-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last April, requires abortion clinics to meet unprecedented medical standards that supporters argue will protect women from unsanitary conditions. Last year Thompson <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/alabama-abortion-law-delayed-by-federal-judge.php">delayed enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of the law until March 2014. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, which initiated the challenge to the Alabama law along with <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy websitew], <a href="https://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/challenge-alabama-abortion-restrictions-go-trial">argues</a> [press release] that the law singles out abortion providers for unnecessary and burdensome restrictions with the purpose of effectively ending abortion in the state.</p>

<p>Abortion continues to be a hot-button legal issue throughout the US, with a number of states proposing laws to limit <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. On Friday West Virginia's Governor <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/west-virginia-governor-vetoes-abortion-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have banned abortions later than 20 weeks after conception. On Thursday the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-texas-abortion-restrictions.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Texas law similar to the one enacted in Alabama that requires physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Also last week the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-appeals-court-allows-kansas-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Kansas legislature can withhold federal funding for two Planned Parenthood clinics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bahraini court on Monday sentenced 13 Bahrain citizens to life in prison and one man to 10 years in prison. The defendants, who range in age from 16 to 34, were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-bahrain-courts-idUSBREA2U0LV20140331">convicted</a> [Reuters report] of attempting to kill two police officers and participating in an illegal protest outside Bahrain's capital city in March 2012. Protests and other clashes have occurred in Bahrain since 2011, when Shi'ite Muslims began demanding more governmental influence in the Sunni-ruled <a href="http://www.bahrain.bh/pubportal/wps/portal/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gLAxNHQ093A3d_J29DA08_cw9TT1dvI8cgU_1wkA6zeGd3Rw8Tcx8DAwsXNwsDIydTM89AAxcDA09TiLwBDuBooO_nkZ-bqh-cWKRfkJ2d5uioqAgAot1KJg!!/dl3/d3/L0lHSkovd0RNQU5rQUVnQSEhL1lCZncvZW4!/">constitutional monarchy of Bahrain</a> [official website]. The lawyer for the defendants, Mohammed al-Tajir, has said he would appeal the court's decision.</p>

<p>Sunni-ruled Bahrain continues to battle public protest and violence from clashes with the Shi'ite minority. Earlier this month, Bahrain's Fourth High Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/bahrain-court-sentences-11-men-accused-of-bomb-making.php">convicted 11 defendants</a> [JURIST report] of possessing weapons, ammunition and explosives and of manufacturing bombs for terror purposes, meting out 15-year prison sentences and significant fines. In November Bahraini authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/bahrain-authorities-arrest-2-former-guantanamo-detainees.php">arrested and charged</a> [JURIST report] two former Guantanamo Bay detainees for plotting an attack in Bahrain. In October a Bahrain appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/bahrain-court-reduces-sentences-for-police-officers-convicted-of-torture-murder.php">reduced the prison sentences</a> [JURIST report] of two police officers convicted of torturing and murdering a detainee after opposition protests in March 2011. In September Mohamed al-Maskati, head of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, reported that a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/bahrain-court-sentences-50-to-prison-in-mass-trial-report.php">sentenced 50 defendants</a> [JURIST report] to prison terms ranging between five and 15 years in prison, with 20 of the defendants sentenced <em>in absentia</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/033114zor_dc8f.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/teva-pharmaceuticals-usa-inc-v-sandoz-inc/">Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.</a> [docket] to determine how the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is to interpret claims in a patent appeal. Federal appeals courts traditionally review a district court's conclusion only to determine if their decision was "clearly erroneous." However, the Federal Circuit has a long-standing practice of reviewing patent appeals <em>de novo</em> by exercising its own independent judgment to assess an inventor's claims. This case, involving the patent of the pharmaceutical company's popular drug for multiple sclerosis, will determine which approach is to be followed by the Federal Circuit. It will be argued next October or November. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court also <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/supreme-court-declines-to-review-challenges-to-contraception-mandate.php">denied review</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-829.htm">Roman Catholic Archbishop v. Sebelius</a> and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-891.htm">Priests for Life v. Health and Human Services Department</a> [dockets] on Monday. These petitions sought the court's review of the validity of government rules to exempt religious employers from having to follow the birth-control mandate in the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [text]. These cases are already scheduled to be heard by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on May 8.</p>]]></content:encoded>
