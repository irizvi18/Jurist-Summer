		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.southernequality.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Judge-Jordan-III-opinion-in-Campaign-for-Southern-Equality-v.-Mississippi-Department-of-Human-Services-et-al.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners on Thursday. The <a href="http://www.southernequality.org">Campaign for Southern Equality</a>, <a href="http://www.familyequality.org">Family Equality Council</a> [advocacy websites] and two female same-sex couples challenged the ban as unconstitutional for discriminating against legally married couples based on the gender of the spouses. The state enacted this law in 2000 when some states began legalizing same-sex marriage. According to the complaint, hundreds of families and thousands of children in Mississippi are disrespected and denied concrete rights, benefits and duties that come with legal parentage. Judge Daniel Jordan III ruled that denying same-sex couples the right to adopt violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and adoption remain controversial issues around the world. In June the governor of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/michigan-governor-signs-bill-allowing-adoption-agencies-to-reject-same-sex-couples.php">signed a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows private adoption agencies to deny placements with same-sex couples for religious reasons. In May the Supreme Court of the US Virgin Islands <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/virgin-islands-top-court-permits-second-parent-adoptions-by-same-sex-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that second-parent adoptions by same-sex couples are permitted under Virgin Islands law. Last April the Florida Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/florida-senate-votes-to-repeal-ban-on-same-sex-adoption.php">voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the state's ban on same-sex adoption. In March of last year the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals ruled that the state <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/alabama-court-recognizes-same-sex-adoption.php">must recognize</a> [JURIST report] the out-of-state adoption of a biological mother's same-sex partner. Also last March the Slovenian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/slovenia-approves-same-sex-marriage-adoption-legislation.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] granting same-sex marriage and adoption rights amid public opposition from conservative and religious groups. In February 2015 the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/Colombia-court-upholds-restrictions-on-adoption-for-same-sex-couples.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a restriction that same-sex couples cannot adopt children that have no biological relation to either parent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Uganda on Thursday rejected a legal challenge to the presidential election held in February which resulted in <a href="https://www.yowerikmuseveni.com/">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [campaign website] being re-elected to a fifth term in office. Opposing candidate <a href="http://www.amamambabazi.com/">Amama Mbabazi</a> [campaign website], who finished in third place in the election, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/africa/ugandas-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-to-presidential-election.html?_r=0">accused</a> [NYT report] the electoral commission of producing false results and demanded recounts in at least 40 districts. Mbabazi pointed to several irregularities, including manipulation of the polls in Kampala, Uganda's capital city, and the absence of election results from its metropolitan area. The court, however, found that Mbabazi's claims of irregularities were unsupported by substantial evidence and did not prove that the election results were affected. Mbabazi's legal challenge was supported by the EU and the US. The <a href="https://ug.usembassy.gov/">Uganda American Embassy</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.facebook.com/U.S.EmbassyKampala/posts/981992741850234:0">responded to the decision on social media</a> [Facebook statement] by noting that the government will hopefully move towards reforming the flawed electoral commission in the future. Though Museveni may hold a fifth term, he will not be allowed to participate in Uganda's next election since he is approaching the 75-year age limit. </p>

<p>Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, belongs to the ruling <a href="https://www.nrm.ug/">National Resistance Movement</a> [party website] party. Last month the UN rights office <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-expresses-concern-over-uganda-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over violence and arrests that erupted on the day of Museveni's re-election. Museveni has been accused of being an authoritarian since he took office by force in 1986, using security forces to retain power.  His government has also been criticized for <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/uganda-lawmakers-draft-new-anti-gay-bill.php">proposing an anti-homosexuality bill</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/uganda-legislature-passes-law-restricting-public-meetings.php">limiting public gatherings</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uganda-chief-justice-says-judiciary-not-free.php">not allowing</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent judiciary. In January Human Rights Watch [advocacy website] reported that the use of force and intimidation of Ugandan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-free-association-crucial-to-fair-uganda-presidential-election.php">limited the chances</a> [JURIST report] of the election being fair and unbiased</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Cambodia, <a href="http://cambodia.ohchr.org/WebDOCs/DocSRBio/SR_Rhona_Smith_Bio-Eng.pdf">Rhona Smith</a> [official profile, PDF], on Friday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18552&LangID=E">appealed</a> [press release] to the country to strengthen the protection of its women and the rights of its indigenous peoples. In her <a href="http://cambodia.ohchr.org/WebDOCs/DocStatements/2016/SR_Mission_Statement_31_March_2016-Eng.pdf">End of Mission Statement</a> [statement, PDF] on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Smith particularly highlighted the "prevalence of violence against women, which continues to present itself as a pervasive human rights violation in Cambodia" and stressed the need for "A revision of the current Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence and Victims' Protection ... to ensure that the response to domestic violence in Cambodia conforms to international standards." Smith also pointed to various other shortfalls in protection of women's rights including the failure to protect identify of victims, use of exploitative and degrading imagery that "perpetuates discriminatory stereotypes and contributes to the desensitization and normalization of violence against women," forced labor conditions for domestic female workers, and increasing vulnerability to human trafficking of women. Smith emphasized that "Strengthening judicial mechanisms which protect victims' rights and ensure the fair prosecution of alleged perpetrators as well as developing gender‐sensitivity training among law enforcement officers," the judiciary, and the press are crucial to achieving real women's rights progress. As to indigenous rights, Smith pointed to deficiencies in the system which have led to unresolved land disputes and displacement of communities, and stressed the need for "clear and transparent resettlement plans that take into account "preservation of sacred forests, burial sites and usufructory practices."</p>

<p>Cambodia has had a history of human rights abuses that have continued to alarm rights organizations around the world. In October the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia. In July 11 Cambodian opposition members were <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/cambodia-opposition-members-sentenced-for-protests.php">sentenced to long prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for participating in July 2014 clashes related to the closing of a protest site. Three of the 11 individuals, all part of the <a href="http://www.nationalrescueparty.org">Cambodian National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP) [party website], were <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/freedom-park-11-jailed">handed 20-year sentences</a> [Phnom Penh Post report]. In March 2015 Cambodia's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/cambodia-passes-controversial-new-election-laws.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] two controversial new election laws that rights groups criticized as ill-conceived and potentially damaging to free speech. In January 2015 Cambodian General Sao Sohka <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodian-commander-admits-to-using-force-against-political-opposition.php">admitted to using force</a> [JURIST report] against political opponents of the reigning Cambodian People's Party. Also in January 2015 the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodia-khmer-rouge-tribunal-restarts-genocide-hearings.php">restarted genocide hearings</a> [JURIST report] against the former Khmer Rouge regime's surviving leaders. Proceedings had been postponed since November 2014, when <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trial-postponed-to-january.php">defense lawyers refused to participate</a> [JURIST report] because they were still working to appeal an earlier verdict. Cambodia continues to struggle with the legacy of the Khmer Rouge, an extremist group that attempted to set up an agrarian socialist society in the nation in the mid- to late-1970s. In October 2014 the Cambodian government released <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/cambodia-children-facing-violence-report.php">survey findings</a> [JURIST report] that showed the magnitude of violence against children throughout the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Military High Court of Kanombe in Rwanda on Thursday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/01/rwanda-ex-military-officers-convicted-over-comments">sentenced</a> [HRW report] Colonel Tom Byabagamba and retired Brigadier General Frank Rusagara to 21 and 20 years in prison respectively on charges of inciting insurrection and tarnishing the government's image. According to <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], the prosecution had accused them of criticizing the government, "alleging state involvement in assassinations of opponents, and complaining about foreign and economic policy." A third officer, retired Sergeant François Kabayiza, was sentenced to five years for concealing evidence. All three officers have indicated their intention to appeal the decision. According to HRW, "the conviction of three Rwandan former military officials in a flawed trial is a clear example of the misuse of the justice system to stifle freedom of expression ... and form part of a pattern of government repression, both inside and outside the country, of people critical of the Rwandan government or suspected of having links with opposition groups ... To prohibit or criminalize the exchange of personal political commentary in private conversations or e-mail exchanges is not a legitimate restriction on the right."</p>

<p>Rwanda has faced criticism for its human rights record. The <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org">International Criminal Tribunal</a> [official website] for Rwanda (ICTR), established in 1994, was the first international tribunal to deliver verdicts against those guilty of committing genocide. Within its 21 years, the ICTR sentenced 61 extremists to terms of up to life imprisonment for their roles in the Rwandan genocide. There were 14 acquittals, and 10 accused were transferred to national courts during this period. An International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals has been established, and eight fugitives remain at large. Only in January 2016, after issuing 45 judgments, did the ICTR <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52926#.Vv6m9za-rdm">formally close</a> [UN News Centre report]. In December <a href="http://www.interpol.int/en">Interpol</a> [official website] agents <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/interpol-arrests-suspect-wanted-for-1994-rwanda-genocide.php">announced the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Rwandan genocide suspect, Ladislas Ntaganzwa, who had a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35062919">US $5 million bounty</a> [BBC report]. In September a court in Toulouse, France, <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/france-court-blocks-extradition-of-genocide-suspect.php">refused extradition requests</a> [JURIST report] for Joseph Habyarimana, a Rwandan man, facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In January 2014 two Rwandan police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/rwanda-police-officers-jailed-for-killing-anti-corruption-activist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in jail for the murder of a Transparency International anti-corruption activist. Last July the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-court-for-rwanda-upholds-sentence-of-ex-military-chief.php">unanimously affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 30-year jail sentence for former army chief Augustin Bizimungu for the role he played in the genocide. In December 2012 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/ASG.aspx">Ivan Simonovic</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18550&LangID=E">acknowledged</a> [press release] the <a href="http://www.gov.md/en">Republic of Moldova's</a> [official website] recent efforts to address governmental issues and promote human rights. Simonovic noted various reforms implemented by Prime Minister Pavel Filip, including a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/NHRA/moldova.pdf">National Human Rights Action Plan</a> [text, PDF] and a requirement that Moldova's Parliament be 40 percent female. Simonovic also stressed that Moldova must continue to implement recommended reforms and address high level corruption in order to revitalize trust in its government and counter human rights issues on all fronts. Among his recommendations were revising criminal code provisions, addressing discriminatory legislation, and implementing input from civil societies and Moldova's Council for Combating and Preventing Discrimination and Ensuring Equality. Simonovic stated that the UN will continue to support reform in Moldova as its government stays committed to promoting human rights. Moldova will receive further recommendations for change after it undergoes its second <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [text] later this year. </p>

<p>Moldova's human rights record had previously been a matter of major concern to international human rights groups. In 2012 Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-group-condemns-moldova-chemical-castration-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Moldova's chemical castration law. That same year the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/europe-court-rules-moldova-gay-protest-ban-violated-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] a Moldova gay protest ban violated the right to protest. A UN Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/moldova-urged-to-adopt-comprehensive-anti-discrimination-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Moldovan government to adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law. The rights of the Romani people have also caused controversy. In 2013 a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-expert-eu-must-do-more-to-support-roma-peoples.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU member states to do more to ensure that Roma peoples receive the support necessary to fully enjoy all their basic human rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Migrant workers preparing for the 2022 World Cup in Doha, Qatar, are facing systematic abuses, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/MDE2235482016ENGLISH.PDF">report</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday. The report included interviews from 234 migrant workers building the Kahlifa International Stadium in Doha or landscaping areas surrounding the Aspire Zone sports complex. These interviews revealed that many workers had been deceived, finding that their salaries were lower than promised and their living conditions included "squalid labour camps, with overcrowded rooms and few facilities." Workers also reported being threatened by their employers when they complained of late payment and their poor working conditions. Many of the contracting companies hiring these migrant workers, including Eversendai and Nakheel, have reportedly confiscated the passports of their migrant employees, "stop[ping] workers from exercising their right to leave a country and mak[ing] them more vulnerable to forced labour." AI went on to state that these conditions were in violation of the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf">Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], requiring companies to have a human rights due diligence process in place to "identify, prevent, mitigate and&#8212;where necessary&#8212;redress human rights abuses connected to their operations[.]" AI called upon FIFA and their sponsors to push for a reform plan by 2017.</p>

<p>The tendency for migrant workers to have fewer protections than other classes of workers has created controversy for years. In November Human Rights Watch reported that Saudi Arabia's <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-saudi-labor-reforms-fail-to-protect-domestic-workers.php">new labor laws protect migrant workers</a> [JURIST report] by forbidding employers from confiscating passports, forbidding employers from paying salaries late, and forbidding employers from not showing employees their contracts. In September the UAE <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/united-arab-emirates-announce-new-labor-reforms.php">announced new labor reforms</a> [JURIST report] to provide increased oversight on the thousands of employment agreements conducted with temporary migrant workers. In April 2014, AI reported on the <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/ai-qatar-failing-to-protect-foreign-domestic-workers-from-exploitation.php">human rights abuses faced by migrant domestic workers</a> [JURIST report] in Qatar. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkey has been forcibly returning up to 100 refugees to Syria per day, since mid-January, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/04/turkey-illegal-mass-returns-of-syrian-refugees-expose-fatal-flaws-in-eu-turkey-deal/">reported</a> [press release] Friday. In addition to Turkish authorities rounding-up refugees in migrant camps near the border, AI has also alleged that some migrants attempting to register in Turkey were, instead, removed back to Syria. The report criticized the recent migrant deal between Turkey and the EU, expressing concern over the possible future of the refugees to be sent back to Turkey after arriving in Greece. "If the agreement proceeds as planned, there is a very real risk that some of those the EU sends back to Turkey will suffer the same fate" AI said. If true, the allegations are illegal under not only international law, but the laws of the EU, and Turkey itself.  </p>

<p>In March EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Under the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-offers-deal-to-turkey-to-take-back-migrants/2016/03/18/809d80ba-ebab-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html">terms of the deal</a> [WP report], all migrants crossing the Aegean into Greece would be sent back to Turkey, effectively turning the country into the region's "migrant holding center." In return for receiving the migrants, the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ">EU is promising</a> [Reuters report] to speed disbursement of €3 billion to Turkey, while offering an additional €3 billion by 2018 contingent upon creation of plans qualifying for EU assistance. That same month, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c8.html">Filippo Grandi</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/56dec2e99.html">expressed concerns</a> [text] for the then <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-eu-migrant-exchange-with-turkey-possibly-illegal.php">proposed migrant exchange program</a> [JURIST report] between the EU and Turkey. Grandi said in his speech before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website], "I am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law." AI  also <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/eu-turkey-summit-eu-and-turkish-leaders-deal-death-blow-to-the-right-to-seek-asylum">demonstrated concern</a> [press release] over the deal, calling it "an alarmingly short-sighted and inhumane attitude to handling this crisis."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a court decision in Brussels Thursday, Belgian authorities agreed to extradite <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/13/world/europe/paris-shooting-attacks.html">Paris attack</a> [NYT timeline] suspect, Salah Abdeslam, to France. Abdeslam was captured in Brussels four days before <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/world/europe/brussels-attacks-what-we-know-and-dont-know.html?_r=0">terror attacks</a> [NYT report] struck an airport and metro station in the capital. He is being held in Brussels, pending questioning by Belgian authorities about the Brussels attacks. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35934179">extradition</a> [BBC report] could take a number of weeks. Abdeslam originally objected to the extradition, but is now cooperating. </p>

<p>The attacks in Paris began on November 13, 2015, with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France around 9:20 PM local time. Soon thereafter, individuals riding in a Seat brand car opened fire on individuals outside cafes around Paris. At around 9:40 PM, assailants fired on concert-goers at the Bataclan concert hall, killing 89. Molins related that these individuals were using "war-type weapons" and explosives, further indicating association with the Islamic State. Speaking about the attacks generally, French President François Hollande <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34820016">called </a> [BBC report] them "an act of war," and vowed that the French "will lead the fight, and we will be ruthless."<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican immigration authorities are returning children that might qualify for formal protection from violence in Central America, <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/03/31/mexico-asylum-elusive-migrant-children">said</a> [press release] Thursday in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/03/31/closed-doors/mexicos-failure-protect-central-american-refugee-and-migrant-children">report</a> [text]. The report states that by law "Mexico offers protection to refugees as well as to others who would face risks to their lives or safety if returned to their countries of origin," but that less than "1 percent of children who are apprehended by Mexican immigration authorities" are recognized as refugees or offered other formal protection. The report also found that Mexican authorities apprehended 55 percent more children last year than in 2014 and 270 percent more children than in 2013. In addition, HRW <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/mexico-child-migrants-central-america-human-rights-watch">found</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that children are not guaranteed legal or any other assistance and those who are face prolonged detention in either closed facilities or "prison-like" settings. HRW found that a part of the reason why Mexican immigration authorities have apprehended more migrant children than before is that the US government has provided increased financial support to Mexico for immigration enforcement since mid-2014. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-failure-to-appoint-counsel-to-represent-migrant-children-violates-international-law.php">announced the filing of an amicus brief</a> [JURIST report] in a US federal court arguing that the failure of US government officials to appoint lawyers to represent migrant children facing deportation violates their basic rights under international law. Also last month the Court of Justice of the EU <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Germany may place "residence conditions" on refugees. Also in March a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-blocks-indiana-governors-order-barring-refugees.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Pence's order keeping Syrian refugees from settling in Indiana. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana originally filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/indiana-governor-sued-over-refusal-to-accept-syrian-refugees.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of Exodus Refugee Immigration in November after Pence announced his plans to suspend resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state as well as assistance from state agencies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official website] expressed his <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18548&LangID=E">deep concern</a> [press release] about the latest reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic (CAR). The High Commissioner is seeking an investigation into the alleged conduct of the UN and French troops. He said the UN is taking these allegations very seriously, aiming to stop the vicious cycle of abuse. The Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), comprising experts on human rights, children and women's protection and conduct and discipline took action launching a full ground investigation. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] stated that it is important to address the issue that the troops sent to protect the area acted in a despicable manner with a depraved and dark hearts. In order to restore trust in the institution and provide justice these allegations must be promptly addressed in an open manner. </p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2854669.stm">François Bozize</a> [BBC profile] in March 2013. More than 400,000 people remain displaced due to the violent overthrow, with over a half million more people seeking refuge in other countries. In November <a href="http://www.unicef.org">UNICEF</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_86387.html">called for</a> [press release] aid to approximately 1.2 million <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php">children distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR. In January of last year members of a UN investigatory commission reported that crimes against humanity have been widely committed by all parties to the conflict in the CAR, prompting the commission to call for the establishment of an <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-investigators-urge-creation-of-war-crimes-tribunal-for-car.php">international court</a> [JURIST report] to objectively investigate and prosecute crimes. Earlier that month the UN published a report stating that violent acts committed in the CAR constituted <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-concludes-war-crimes-in-car-not-genocide.php">war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report], but not genocide. Despite this finding, members of the international community maintain that there is much <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation. In 2014 the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] opened a <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-prosecutor-opens-second-investigation-into-central-african-republic-war-crimes.php">second investigation</a> [JURIST report] into CAR war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court of Brazil ruled Thursday that it will take over the corruption probe against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva instead of returning the case to federal Judge Serio Moro. Senior officials are not <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/brazil-supreme-court-asserts-jurisdiction-over-lula-case-116040100152_1.html">immune</a> [Business Standard report] from prosecution, but can only be tried before the Supreme Court. Judge Sergio Moro has been leading the corruption case relating to the Petrobras scandal and has been accused of unfairly targeting the former president. Current President Dilma Rousseff's appointment of Lula as the former's chief of state, has remained in "<a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/04/01/brazil-supreme-court-to-take-up-investigation-into-former-president-lula-da/">limbo</a>" [AP report] for weeks awaiting a decision by the Supreme Court to authorize and lift the injunction that is currently preventing Silva from taking office. Lula's appointment as Chief of State would afford him greater legal protections under Brazilian law, granting the Supreme Court the only institution to authorize an investigation, detention and indictment of a Cabinet member.</p>

<p>Last month, a judge for the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-high-court-judge-upholds-order-barring-appointment-of-ex-president.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a ruling blocking Lula from taking a cabinet post. Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians including former presidents have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. Also in March, Brazil's Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-supreme-court-authorizes-corruption-trial-for-presidents-rival.php">authorized</a> [JURIST report] the corruption charges against member of Congress Eduardo Cunha to proceed. Eduardo Cunha was implicated in the Petrobras scandal. Rousseff herself has been implicated in that very same scandal and has been at the center of impeachment <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">proceedings</a> [JURIST report] for months. She spoke against the accusations against her earlier this week, stating that she will take <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">legal action</a> [JURIST report] against the senator who made statements against her for defamation. More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://aclum.org/">The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts</a> (ACLUM) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="https://aclum.org/app/uploads/2016/03/AWA_Motion_16-MC-91097.pdf">motion</a> [motion, PDF] on Tuesday to request that the federal court unseal any docket sheets associated with a government request to unlock an iPhone in Massachusetts. The ACLUM says no formal applications or orders exist in the docket in connection with the government's request, but that it was referenced in a publicly docketed affidavit filed by an FBI special agent. This suggests, the ACLUM claims, that if documents for the request exist, they are held separately in sealed dockets. The motion argues that these should be unsealed because the public has a First Amendment right to access materials relating to criminal proceedings as well as common law right to access judicial documents. ACLUM conducted research with the national ACLU finding over 60 cases in which the government sought assistance from Apple or Google to unlock electronic devices.</p>

<p>This motion was just days after the US <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-drops-case-against-apple-aftering-unlocking-iphone.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] its case seeking to compel Apple to assist unlocking the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone, saying the DOJ has accessed the data itself. In February Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-files-objections-to-order-to-unlock-iphone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a brief in the US District Court for the Central District of California in opposition of the US government's request for the company to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook. Counsel for Apple called the case "unprecedented" after the DOJ filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-motion-to-compel-apple-to-unlock-shooters-phone.php">motion to compel</a> [JURIST report] Apple to unlock the encrypted iPhone. In response to the legal conflict, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-asks-congress-to-create-expert-panel-on-privacy-issues.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US government to create a panel of experts to discuss issues of security versus privacy. These developments came after Apple refused the initial court order to assist the government in unlocking the iPhone from one of the San Bernardino shooters. That court had <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-magistrate-orders-apple-to-assist-us-government-in-unlocking-individuals-phone.php">required</a> [JURIST report] Apple to supply software to the FBI to disable a self-destruct feature that erases phone data after 10 failed attempts to enter the phone's password.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] requested on Friday that UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] consult with the government of Burundi and members of the African Union about an option that would enable the council to deploy a UN police component to Burundi. The resolution <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53600#.VwAZupwrLIU">expressed concern</a> [press release] over increasing violence in Burundi and the humanitarian consequences that may arise and seeks to obtain a list of options from Ban within the next 15 days. The council is also urging Ban to increase engagement between the UN and Burundi and expressed an intent to take measures against any violence contributing to the violence or hindering peacemaking efforts.</p>

<p>Violence in Burundi began in the wake of President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, for which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] in July. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein also expressed concern over increased violence and rights violations in Burundi, and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-calls-for-inclusive-political-dialogue-to-end-burundi-crisis.php">called for an "inclusive political dialogue"</a> [JURIST report] to end the 11-year struggle. Speaking to the council about his trip to Burundi last month, the secretary-general stated, "I cannot stress enough the profound humanitarian consequences that political unrest, violence and impunity carry for the population." In January the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report stating that Burundian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-not-allowed-to-enter-burundi.php">barred entry</a> [JURIST report] into Burundi to independent rights experts dispatched by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate violations in the nation. Also in January Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-warns-against-increasing-violence-in-burundi.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of increasing violence in Burundi. In December the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution to dispatch experts to investigate human rights violations in Burundi, condemning violence in the country, use of excessive force by officials and restrictions on freedoms. In November the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-adopts-resolution-to-work-to-end-violence-in-burundi.php">unanimously adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution condemning the political violence and killings currently afflicting Burundi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Netherlands will vote in a non-binding advisory referendum on Wednesday regarding Dutch ratification of the EU-Ukraine trade agreement. The <a href="http://ukraine-eu.mfa.gov.ua/en/page/open/id/2900">EU-Ukraine deal</a> [materials] will remove trade barriers between the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] and the Ukraine. Many Dutch citizens <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d66cecd936064c0da74df109e6d05a3c/netherlands-hold-referendum-eu-ukraine-deal">view the EU unfavorably</a> [AP report] due to its expansion and allegedly "undemocratic decision-making processes." Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte <a href="http://www.nu.nl/politiek/4238959/interview-rutte-we-moeten-wens-van-rusland-niet-belonen.html">stated to the press</a> [NU report, in Dutch] about the deal: "[W]e believe that Ukraine should have both a good relationship with Europe and with Russia. [They] can not if they are in the European Union."</p>

<p>The EU is a partnership of 28 European countries for political and economic purposes, with its own currency adopted by 19 member nations. It began in the 1950s as the European Economic Community (EEC) to promote a single economic market without trade barriers. The Treaty on the European Union was signed in the Netherlands in 1992, and an EU Constitution was approved by the member nations in 2004. In the years since, many in the UK have voiced concerns about remaining in the EU, with critics saying it has too much control over UK citizens. In February the UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/uk-pm-announces-eu-referendum-date.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the UK will hold a referendum on June 23 to vote on whether the nation will remain a part of the European Union. Last month the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-expert-urges-safeguards-in-eu-turkey-migrant-deal.php">addressed the agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the (EU) and Turkey, stating that it is important to ensure safeguards in executing the agreement and to respect international and European law in the process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Polish citizens protested on Sunday a possible total abortion ban following the suggestion of the ruling legislative party's president. The ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party wants to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/03/warsaw-protest-against-proposed-abortion-ban">bring the country's abortion policies in line</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] with the Catholic Church's views on the practice, and party president Jaroslaw Kaczynski recently backed the church's position. The majority of Polish citizens consider themselves to be Roman Catholic. Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-04-03/poles-protest-possible-tightening-of-abortion-law">supports</a> [AP report] the total ban on abortions. Poland currently already has one of the strict abortion laws, but this proposed ban would eliminate abortion in all cases, cease state funding for in-vitro fertilization, and reinstate the prescription requirement for emergency contraception. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Abortion access and reproductive healthcare</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain contentious issues worldwide. The High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland in November <a href="https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2015/%5B2015%5D%20NIQB%2096/j_j_HOR9740Final.htm">ruled</a> [judgment] that Northern Ireland's abortion laws, which only allow abortion when the mother faces the risk of death or serious injury, are a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/northern-ireland-court-restrictive-abortion-laws-violate-human-rights.php">violation of human rights</a> [JURIST report]. According to an Amnesty International report released the same month, El Salvador's complete ban on abortion <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-el-salvador-abortion-law-breeding-atmosphere-of-fear.php">negatively affects</a> [JURIST report] not only women and girls, but also their families. A Dominican court in December <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/dominican-republic-high-court-restores-total-abortion-ban.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a new law that would have decriminalized abortion if a pregnant woman's life was at risk, thus reinstating a total ban on abortion within the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Azerbaijan on Sunday announced a "unilateral ceasefire" to the fighting with Armenian forces over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. The announcement comes a day after UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53601#.VwGQx6QrKUl">called for</a> [UN news report] an immediate end to the fighting between the two countries, as there have been reports of increased fighting and large-scale ceasefire violations along the Line of Contact in the region. The fighting <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35953916">had continued</a> [BBC report] until Sunday, which up until that point had led to the deaths of 30 soldiers and civilian casualties. Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9584">stated</a> [statement] that he was particularly concerned with the use of heavy weapons and by the large numbers of casualties.</p>

<p>Nagorno-Karabakh has been a territory under <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325">dispute</a> [BBC backgrounder] between Armenia and Azerbaijan since the two countries became independent in the early 1990's. The area, located within Azerbaijan but made up of a majority Armenian ethnicity population, is landlocked by mountains and has been contended for by the two sides since the 19th century. In 1988 a war was fought between the two sides which left the area in the hands of Armenia with a tentative truce signed in 1994. However, negotiations since have failed to produce a permanent peace agreement. In 2010, Turkey expressed its  support for Azerbaijan, as Armenia continues to allege that Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">committed genocide</a> [JURIST report] during the time of the Ottoman era in the early 1900s. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Flint, Michigan has filed an intent to sue letter with the state, claiming that the city lacks funds to defend itself against lawsuit filed during the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/health/flint-water-crisis-timeline/">water crisis</a> [CNN timeline]. The city's new chief legal officer, Stacy Erwin Oakes, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/01/us/flint-water-crisis-michigan-lawsuit/">stated</a> [CNN report] that the city filed the notice over damages to the municipal water system and associated costs. Although some state lawmakers immediately criticized the move as potentially hindering the state's ability to aid the city in repairs, Flint Mayor <a href="https://www.cityofflint.com/mayors-bio/">Karen Weaver</a> [official profile] stated that the notice was sent purely due to a legal requirement. She said that the city would have lost their right to sue in the future if it had not filed the "Notice of Intention to File a Claim" by the March 25th deadline. She noted that they city does not have any intention of filing a lawsuit now, but had to keep the right to sue open for the city if issues arise in the future. </p>

<p>Public officials have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/what-did-the-governor-know-about-flints-water-and-when-did-he-know-it/423342/">come under fire</a> [<em>Atlantic</em> report] for their response to the crisis, as it took 20 months after the initial switch in water supply for an emergency to be declared by the state. Last week a Michigan firm <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-flint-children-exposed-to-water.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the children of Flint. Earlier this month seven families living in Flint, Michigan, filed a <a href="https://dlbjbjzgnk95t.cloudfront.net/0768000/768552/flint%20suit.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Governor Rick Snyder alleging <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">gross negligence</a> [JURIST report] in connection to the lead-contaminated water. This same month a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-experts-urge-us-to-address-michigan-water-contamination.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its efforts to address the issue of lead-contaminated water in Flint, Michigan. In January the Natural Resources Defense Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-lead-pipes-in-flint-michigan.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking the replacement of lead water pipes in the city of Flint. The lawsuit, filed in conjunction with Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Flint resident Melissa Mays, seeks to force city and state officials to mediate alleged violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Also in January Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette appointed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/michigan-ag-appoints-former-prosecutor-to-investigate-flint-water-crisis.php">former prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] to act as Special Counsel in his investigation into the water contamination crisis in the city of Flint, and a retired Detroit FBI chief will also participate in the investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] World leaders and other high profile individuals are hiding billions in off-shore accounts, according to reports Sunday that cite confidential documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm. The documents, coined the <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/">"Panama Papers"</a> [website] by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, purportedly show that numerous politicians, celebrities and other wealthy individuals have hid money utilizing the legal services of <a href="http://www.mossfon.com/">Mossack Fonseca</a> [firm website]. The Panama Papers include 11 million documents allegedly illustrating how Mossack Fonseca laundered money and helped their wealthy clients avoid tax consequences and dodge sanctions. It is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844">reported</a> [BBC report] that 12 heads of state are among those implicated by the Panama Papers. Mossack Fonseca has denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were the victim of a data breach and that they have not engaged in any illegal activity.</p>

<p>Tax evasion remains an important global issue. Last year <a href="https://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/">HSBC</a> [corporate website], a Swiss private bank, was a part of on-going string of fraudulent practice investigations since the 2009 leaks by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31296007">Herve Falciani</a> [BBC profile]. Currently HSBC is under investigation by <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/explanation-of-hsbc-tax-evasion-scandal-2015-3">eight nations for tax evasion</a> [Business Insider report]. Last month the Swiss police <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-31516416">raided HSBC's Geneva office on suspicion of aggravated money laundering</a> [BBC report]. In 2012 the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/hsbc-holdings-plc-and-hsbc-bank-usa-na-admit-anti-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations">announced</a> [press release] that HSBC Holdings and <a href="https://www.us.hsbc.com/1/2/home/personal-banking">HSBC Bank USA</a> [corporate website], a federally chartered banking corporation based in Virginia, agreed to forfeit USD $1.256 billion to settle a multi-year probe related to the group's failure to enforce rules to prevent money laundering. As part of the DOJ's deal, HSBC agreed to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement for its violation of various federal laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040416zor_5i36.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in a case regarding racial bias expressed in jury deliberation and whether the no-impeachment rules applied in this scenario violate an individual's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] right to an impartial jury. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-606.htm">Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado</a> [docket] has come before the Supreme Court because after the initial verdict against Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez, two jurors came forward and alleged that another juror had made <a href="http://www.newschannel10.com/story/31635652/supreme-court-will-take-up-case-about-jurors-racial-bias">racially-charged comments</a> [AP report] during deliberation that suggested the verdict could have been based on racial bias. Pena-Rodriguez sought a new trial, but the Colorado court determined that the state's "no impeachment" rule required jurors to be ineligible to testify about statements made during deliberation, so the petition for a writ of <em>certiorari</em> was <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Pena-Rodriguez-Cert-Petition-COMBINED.pdf">filed</a> [text, PDF].</p>

<p>State and federal courts alike have no-impeachment rules to "promote the finality of verdicts and to shield jurors from outside influences." However, court decisions have been split as far as the application of the rule to situations such as this, where the statements in question could have infringed upon an individual's constitutional rights. Colorado argues that the no-impeachment rule should prevent the statements from being used as evidence, and they argue that even if considered, there is evidence suggesting the statements did not influence the decision. Racial bias is not only present on the decision-making side, however. On the other end of the jury process, the Supreme Court in November heard <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-racial-discrimination-in-jury-selection.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case dealing with racial discrimination in the jury selection process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040416zor_5i36.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] on Monday in two cases regarding <a href="http://corporate.walmart.com">Wal-Mart Stores</a> [corporate website]. The petition <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Petition-Pa.-Superior-Ct-1.pdf">raised the issue</a> [petition, PDF] of whether the Fourteenth Amendment <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Due Process Clause</a> [text] prohibits a state court from certifying a class action and entering judgment in favor of the class, where the court relieves individual plaintiffs of their burden to prove "class-wide common evidence on key elements of their claims." The court's decision leaves intact a <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/j-43b-2013mo%20-%201020442252915360.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2014, which upheld a lower court decision awarding $187 million to the plaintiffs.</p>

<p>This is the most recent lawsuit of those filed against Wal-Mart in past years. In August 2013 a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-rejects-class-status-in-wal-mart-discrimination-suit.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a potential gender discrimination class action lawsuit against Wal-Mart. In June 2012 New York City filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/new-york-city-files-suit-against-wal-mart.php">derivative suit</a> [JURIST report] in Delaware Chancery Court against Wal-Mart, alleging that both officers and board members of the company breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by improperly handling reports of bribery that occurred in Mexico. In June 2011 a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-sets-deadline-in-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-suit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a group of women seeking to recover damages from Wal-Mart could file lawsuits until October of that year. This ruling came after the US Supreme Court rejected the 2001 class action, and applied to the women who had received the required permission to sue from the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website]. In February 2011 Wal-Mart also escaped liability after a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-upholds-wal-mart-firing-of-medical-marijuana-user.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Wal-Mart did not wrongly fire an employee who had been using medical marijuana to treat a brain tumor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police and military raids in low-income communities in Venezuela are leading to allegations of widespread abuse, the <a href="http://www.derechos.org.ve/">Venezuelan Human Rights Education-Action Program</a> (PROVEA) and <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] said in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/288189/">joint report</a> [text] issued Monday. Titled "Unchecked Power: Police and Military Raids in Low-Income and Immigrant Communities in Venezuela," this report <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/04/venezuela-police-raids-hit-poor-areas">outlines allegations</a> [press release] including extrajudicial killings, mass arbitrary detentions, maltreatment of detainees, forced evictions, the destruction of homes and the arbitrary deportation of Colombian nationals. The abuses are connected to "Operation to Liberate and Protect the People" (OLP), the Venezuelan government's anti-crime initiative which began in July 2015 to combat the presence of criminal gangs and has since resulted in the deaths of 250 people.</p>

<p>Unemployment is rampant in Venezuela, and an economic boom in 1970 led to a recession that crushed the middle class and lowered the living standards of poor, who constitute approximately 60 percent of the population. The Venezuelan High Court and General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">have been at odds</a> recently, as the court is <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">heavily influenced by the government</a> [JURIST reports]. An anti-government party is prominent in the assembly, contributing to the climate of unrest. In 2014 the UN Human Rights Chief called for an <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-venezuela.php">end to violence in Venezuela</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14292&LangID=E">urged all parties</a> [official statement] involved to move towards meaningful dialogue in hopes of resolving the situation.               </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-5238_khlo.pdf">ruled unanimously</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nichols-v-united-states/">Nichols v. US</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/sex-offender-registration-and-notification-act-sorna">Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act</a> (SONRA) [DOJ backgrounder] did not require an individual to update his registration in Kansas once he departed the state and moved to a foreign country, overruling the Tenth Circuit. In 2003 Lester Nichols was <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/opinion-analysis-news-item-the-convicted-sex-offender-wins-unanimously/">charged</a> [SCOTUSblog op-ed] with traveling in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. Under SORNA, Nichols was required to register as a sex offender in Kansas, which he did after he elected to reside there in 2011. In 2012 Nichols abruptly moved to the Philippines and did not update his residency information with Kansas authorities. He was arrested in the Philippines for not registering, and the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] affirmed his conviction. In Monday's ruling, the court focused its decision on a straightforward reading of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16913">42 USC &#167; 16913(a)</a> [text], which states, in relevant part: "A sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender <em>resides</em>." The court emphasized the use of the present tense limits the application of the statute. The government argued that Kansas qualified as a jurisdiction that Nichols was required to notify within three days of his departure, because under section (c) of the relevant statute, a sex offender must notify at least one jurisdiction involved of any modification to one's name, residence, employment, or student status. The court rejected the government's attempt to work-around the language in section (a), and the court stated: "We are thus reassured that our holding today is not likely to create 'loopholes and deficiencies' in SORNA's nationwide sex-offender registration scheme." The declaration is timely as a new law was enacted in February by US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/515">International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes Through Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders</a> [Congressional bill summary] that will require sex offenders to notify the US government when they leave the US or intend to travel in foreign commerce.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-sex-offender-registration-false-representation.php">heard oral argument</a> [JURIST report] in <u>US v. Nichols</u> in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abott</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that States may use total population to appropriate state legislative districts, and there is no constitutional requirement that states use voter population in order to divide up legislative districts. This case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-940">arose</a> [Oyez Project summary] after the 2010 census when the Texas legislature created a redistricting plan. Appellants argued that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] required jurisdictions to draw state and local legislative districts with equal voter-eligible populations, "thus protecting the right of eligible voters to an equal vote." In opposition, Texas argued that jurisdictions may design voting districts using any population baseline including total population and voter-eligibility population&#8212;as long as the choice is rational. The court stated its holding as follows: "In agreement with Texas and the United States, we reject appellants' attempt to locate a voter-equality mandate in the Equal Protection Clause. As history, precedent, and practice demonstrate, it is plainly permissible for jurisdictions to measure equalization by the total population of state and local legislative districts." </p>

<p>The Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-state-legislative-maps.php">heard oral argument</a> in <u>Evenwel v. Abbott</u> in December after <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-voter-equality-case.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] last May.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bela Biszku, a high-ranking Communist official convicted of war crimes committed during the aftermath of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5379586.stm">Hungarian revolution</a> [BBC backgrounder], died on Thursday at the age of 94. When Soviet forces <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/world/europe/bela-biszku-communist-hungary-1956-uprising.html">shut down</a> [AP report] the Hungarian uprising in 1956, more than 224 civilians were executed and 10,000 civilians imprisoned. At the time, Biszku was operating as a Hungary's interior minister. Though he denied any involvement, historians claim that Biszku was a member of the Communist Party's executive committee and played a key role in implementing repression. </p>

<p>In 2014, Biszku was sentenced to over 5 years imprisonment and was connected to approximately 50 deaths. During <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/hungary-court-orders-retrial-of-communist-era-war-crimes-convict.php">retrial</a> [JURIST report] last December, Biszku's sentence was reduced and he was absolved of communist party-related crimes. When Biszku passed away in Budapest, his conviction was still pending further appeal. <br />

		<title>ACLU: South Carolina defendants lack legal representation in summary courts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Carolina's summary courts, which try and convict defendants for low-level offenses, are failing to provide legal representation and other constitutional safeguards, according to a <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/assets/pdf/ACLU%20Summary%20Injustice.pdf">study</a> [text, PDF] released Monday by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. According to the study, summary court judges are not required to have law degrees, and police officers may serve as prosecutors. The state needs at least $10 million to properly fund its public defenders, and since last year municipalities can not use their judicial circuits' public defenders unless they contribute more funds. Due to the lack of proper funding, the state has instructed judges to inform defendants of available free representation only when they go to trial. Most poor defendants in summary court proceedings have no legal representation, and they often serve the maximum jail sentence of 30 days because they cannot afford to pay even low bail amounts. The ACLU stressed that poor defendants are effectively being victimized for their inability to receive legal representation and pay bail fines, thereby having a detrimental affect on their jobs and families. The ACLU <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20160403/PC16/160409926/1177/in-sc-x2019-s-lowest-criminal-courts-the-poor-suffer-without-attorneys-aclu-finds">plans</a> [<em>Post and Courier </em>report] to release a new study later this year that provides more data regarding this statewide issue. The study was gathered by collecting observations from the state's 400 summary courts from late 2014 to July 2015. </p>

<p>Reform in state courts and prisons had been a matter of ongoing concern in the US. Last month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] letters to states urging them to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants and victimize them for their inability to pay. In February the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/california-supreme-court-rules-governor-can-move-forward-with-prison-overcrowding-ballot-measure.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Jerry Brown can put his plan to ease prison overcrowding on the ballot this November. In January the US Supreme Court ruled that a landmark decision banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles should <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. In August the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/doj-reaches-settlement-with-la-prisons-on-mentally-ill-inmate-care.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Los Angeles prisons on mentally ill inmate care. Last May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-us-prisons-using-excessive-force-on-mentally-disabled-prisoners.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that mentally disabled prisoners experience "unnecessary, excessive, and even malicious force" at the hands of prison staff across the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of three UN peacekeepers accused of sexual misconduct in the Central African Republic (CAR) began on Tuesday in front of a tribunal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Two of the peacekeepers are charged with raping minors, and a third is charged with attempted rape of a minor during a peacekeeping mission in 2013. All three<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/peacekeepers-trial-sex-abuse-car-160405040318812.html">pleaded not guilty</a> [Al Jazeera report].</p>

<p>This is the latest development in the <a href="https://www.crin.org/en/home/campaigns/transparency/uncover">rise of allegations</a> [CRIN Timeline] against UN peacekeepers of sexual abuse and exploitation. Last month <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-report-finds-increase-in-allegations-of-sexual-abuse-by-un-peacekeepers.php">recommending increased measures</a> [JURIST report] to be taken for all countries involved. The report documents a total of 99 allegations in 2015, 69 from countries with peacekeeping missions. The largest number of allegations, 22, came from the CAR, followed by the DRC and Haiti. Also last month <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/peacekeepers-trial-sex-abuse-car-160405040318812.html">20 former UN peacekeepers went on trial</a> [Reuters report] in the DRC following rape accusations. In December Ban made a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/centafricrepub/Independent-Review-Report.pdf">pledge to review allegations</a> [text, PDF] that found the UN had not responded properly to information regarding crimes by non-UN soldiers upon children in the CAR. In February the UN identified <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53163#.VwPBqxMrIci">seven new possible victims</a> [press release] of abuse in the nation. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] said his office is <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16995&LangID=E">investigating allegations of sexual abuse</a> [press release] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-foreign-soldiers-sexually-abusing-children-in-central-african-republic.php">against children in the CAR by EU forces</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] on Monday entered a final judgement approving a $20 billion <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/OilSpill/4042016ConsentDecree_0.pdf">settlement</a> [consent decree, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/OilSpill/OilSpill.htm">BP Oil Spill case</a> [case information]. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/bp-agrees-to-187-billion-settlement-over-2010-oil-spill.php">settlement was reached</a> [JURIST report] last summer and has been awaiting final approval. The agreement between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] and the affected Gulf states specifically requires the company to pay at least $12.8 billion in penalties stipulated under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/lcwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> [text] and natural resource damages. The case the largest environmental settlement in US history. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-statement-agreement-bp-settle-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill">said</a> [statement], "[t]oday's action holds BP accountable with the largest environmental penalty of all time while launching one of the most extensive environmental restoration efforts ever undertaken." </p>

<p>The April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill has had far-reaching and catastrophic <a href="/feature/2014/03/environmental-and-human-impact-of-bp-oil-spill.php">environmental and economic effects</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last year the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-government-to-appeal-ruling-reducing-bps-potential-oil-spill-liability.php">appealed a federal court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that reduced the potential liability BP faces under the Clean Water Act in relation to the 2010 spill. In February of last year District Court Judge Carl Barbier of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-rejects-bp-petitition-to-reduce-oil-spill-fine.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by BP to reduce the civil fine payable under the Clean Water Act. BP's appeal sought to reduce the fine per barrel from the $4,300 proposed by the US government to $3,000 per barrel. In December 2014 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-declines-to-review-bp-oil-spill-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to review a settlement with BP resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. In August 2014 a federal district court in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-judge-finds-bp-bears-majority-of-responsibility-for-deepwater-horizon-disaster.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that BP was grossly negligent and bears a majority of the blame for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/712382/detainee-transfers-announced">announced the transfer</a> [press release] of two Guantanamo detainees to Senegal. Libyan nationals Salem Abdu Salam Ghereby, 55, and Omar Khalif Mohammed Abu Baker Mahjour, about 44, were <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-04-04/senegal-takes-in-2-libyan-prisoners-from-guantanamo">released</a> [AP report] after being held nearly 14 years without charges. Last week a US government official said that the DOD has told Congress that it <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-government-official-announces-guantanamo-detainee-transfers.php">plans to transfer</a> [JURIST report] as many as 12 prisoners from Guantanamo in the coming weeks. With Monday's transfers, 89 detainees remain at the facility.</p>

<p>In February US President Obama delivered a plan to Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">close Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The DOD <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">said</a> [JURIST report] in October they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/donate-today?ea.tracking.id=ED2016EVSCgl&gclid=Cj0KEQjwxI24BRDqqN3f-97N6egBEiQAGv37hE6IonFXsyf5IwG9jd8AhyuRIA99Kx39kCOEdP8R_pEaAnjN8P8HAQ&variation=5344140064_1">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and several other rights groups on Tuesday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/05/thailand-rights-groups-condemn-juntas-sweeping-powers-order">urged</a> [press release] Thailand to repeal an order granting sweeping police powers to the military, expressing concern that it will worsen human rights conditions. The <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-military-granted-police-powers.php">law</a> [JURIST report] grants broad powers to "prevent and suppress 27 categories of crimes including against public peace, liberty and reputation, immigration, human trafficking, narcotics, and weapons." The law allows those acting under it to escape prosecution and grants broad discretionary power to officers who may possess low levels of training. The president of the <a href="https://www.fidh.org/en/">International Federation for Human Rights</a> (FDIH) [advocacy website], Karim Lahidji, cautioned that although the law purports "to suppress criminal activities" it "is likely to result in the commission of very serious crimes that are prohibited under human rights instruments that Thailand has either signed or ratified."</p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over Thailand's governmental impunity since it became a military junta in May 2014. In January the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-thailand-must-fully-investigate-forced-disappearances.php">Thai government to fully investigate</a> [JURIST report] the whereabouts of at least 82 people listed as disappeared and to criminalize forced disappearance through legislation. That same month, Thailand unveiled a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/thailands-draft-constitution-unveiled.php">new draft constitution</a> [JURIST report], which human rights groups stated was aimed at increasing the power of the military under the guise of clauses intended to promote national security, permitting the government to commit human rights abuses without fear of punishment in violation of international treaties. In December Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-torture-allegations-in-koh-tao-murder-case-must-be-investigated.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] a thorough investigation into torture allegations levied against the police responsible for the arrests of two men in relation to the Koh Tao murders. The men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, were found guilty of the murder of two British tourists in the vacation island of Koh Tao. The defense team for the Myanmar nationals claims that their confessions were coerced, and that DNA evidence linking the men to the crime was severely mishandled and unreliable. In November the UN Human Rights Office for South-East Asia urged Thailand to <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-office-urges-thailand-to-end-civilian-detentions-in-military-centers.php">immediately close</a> [JURIST report] a military detention center in Bangkok where two high-profile inmates died in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bangladeshi prime minister <a href="http://bnpbangladesh.com/en/index.php/begum-khaleda-zia">Khaleda Zia</a> [BNP profile] surrendered on Tuesday to a court after an arrest warrant was issued against her in connection with the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/fire-bomb-attacks-leave-dead-bangladesh-150208043255263.html">firebombing bus attack</a> [Al Jazeera report] last year staged in opposition of the government. She was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-opposition-idUSKCN0X20HH">granted bail</a> [Reuters report] on consideration of her physical condition and her age of 70. Arrest warrants have also been issued for 27 others in the <a href="http://bangladeshnationalistparty-bnp.org/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP) [party website] for suspected involvement in the attack.</p>

<p>In January Zia was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-bangladesh-prime-minister-ordered-to-appear-in-court-following-sedition-charges.php">ordered to appear in court</a> [JURIST report] following charges of sedition. Zia was granted bail last April after surrendering to the court in Dhaka. The leader of the opposition BNP, Zia had been <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32188301">voluntarily confined</a> [BBC report] to her office since January of last year. She faces charges of embezzling money stemming from two corruption cases between 2001 and 2006. The <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/bangladesh-court-orders-former-pm-to-stand-trial-for-corruption.php">trial began in 2014</a>, and an <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bangladesh-opposition-leader-arrested-for-instigating-arson.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] was issued in February of last year when she failed to appear in court. In May 2008 Bangladesh's <a href="http://www.acc.org.bd/">Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (ACC) [official website] filed formal charges against Zia for an alleged kickback scheme that awarded lucrative gas contracts to Canadian oil company Niko Resources Ltd. In March 2014 the former prime minister and other members of the BNP <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/former-bangladesh-pm-charged-with-corruption.php">were indicted</a> [JURIST report] on two corruption charges, accused of embezzling funds from a charitable trust named after Zia's deceased husband. Bangladesh's High Court ruled Zia <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/bangladesh-court-orders-former-pm-to-stand-trial-for-corruption.php">must stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges last April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.national-assembly.org.kh/">National Assembly of Cambodia</a> [official website, in Khmer] approved legislation on Monday that sets rules for the creation and operation of trade unions. All 67 members of the ruling <a href="http://www.cpp.org.kh/">Cambodian People's Party</a> [party website, in Khmer] voted for the law, which <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cambodian-parliament-passes-disputed-trade-union-law-38154234">passed</a> [AP report] the lower house of the legislature and now moves to the senate. The government of Cambodia supports this legislation, despite <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/cambodian-opposition-activists-slam-new-trade-union-law/3269693.html">backlash</a> [VOA report] by unions who say the law will make it difficult to strike and allows union leader discrimination. The <a href="http://cambodia.ohchr.org/">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia</a> [official website] <a href="http://cambodia.ohchr.org/WebDOCs/DocNewsIndex/2016/032016/TUL_Analysis-Eng.pdf">released a report</a> [report, PDF] last week that stated the draft law is in violation of international labor conventions.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have led to international concern. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-warns-cambodias-political-polarization-reaching-breaking-point.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the increasing polarization of the political parties in Cambodia is reaching a breaking point. In October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia. In April the UN Human Rights Committee stated that the government needs to make public all draft legislation in order to facilitate debate. Cambodia has had a history of human rights abuses that have continued to alarm rights organizations around the world. In March Cambodia's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/cambodia-passes-controversial-new-election-laws.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] two controversial new election laws that rights groups criticized as ill-conceived and potentially damaging to free speech. In January Cambodian General Sao Sohka <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodian-commander-admits-to-using-force-against-political-opposition.php">admitted to using force</a> [JURIST report] against political opponents of the reigning Cambodian People's Party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S215614.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that employees who can do their jobs while seated are entitled to a place to sit. The court <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Workers-who-can-sit-on-the-job-are-entitled-to-7227693.php">held</a> [SFGate report] in a 7-0 ruling that "if the tasks being performed at a given location reasonably permit sitting, and provision of a seat would not interfere with performance of any other tasks that may require standing, a seat is called for." The court interpreted California law in this matter at the request of the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], which is considering employee suits against <a href="https://www.cvshealth.com/">CVS</a>, <a href="https://www.chase.com/">Chase Bank</a> and <a href="http://corporate.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> [corporate websites]. Justice Carol Corrigan wrote in the court's opinion that "there is no principled reason for denying an employee a seat when he spends a substantial part of his workday at a single location performing tasks that could reasonably be done while seated, merely because his job duties include other tasks that must be done standing." The court reasoned that whether a worker is entitled to a seat depends on the totality of circumstances, such as whether the task can be performed from a chair, whether sitting would interfere with job performance and whether the physical layout of the work space permits the use of a chair. The decision will allow positions such as cashiers and bank tellers among others, to be seated for at least a portion of their day. Now that the California Supreme Court has ruled in this matter, it is expected that the Ninth Circuit will resolves over a dozen similar cases within the state.</p>

<p>The right of an employee to sit in certain situations is another instance of the growing national debate and standards on employment issues. In February the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-tip-distribution-violates-labor-standards.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that employers may no longer collect tips from service employees and share them with support staffed even if the tipped employees are receiving minimum wage. Earlier that month Oregon legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/oregon-lawmakers-approve-highest-minimum-wage-in-country.php">approved a law creating the highest minimum wage</a> [JURIST report] in the country. Also in February West Virginia became the twenty-sixth state to pass a right-to-work law, <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/west-virginia-legislature-passes-right-to-work-law.php">barring employers</a> [JURIST report] from requiring that their employees pay union fees. In 2015 US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/obama-to-issue-order-ensuring-sick-leave-for-federal-contractor-employees.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] requiring federal contractors to provide sick leave to employees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chile's justice system <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/chile-two-tier-justice-system-allows-police-to-get-away-with-human-rights-violations/">allows for police brutality</a> [press release] by requiring such cases to be heard in military courts, where similar personnel manage the judicial process, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr22/3209/2016/en/">report</a> [text] Tuesday. According to the report:<blockquote>Under the Chilean Code of Military Justice, common crimes committed by members of the military&#8212#8212;including the <em>Carabineros de Chile</em> (National Police)&#8212;in the exercise of their duties or in connection with them, must be investigated and tried by military courts. This means that crimes, including excessive use of force by police and other possible human rights violations, committed by members of the security forces while carrying out their duties are dealt with by the military courts rather than the ordinary courts.</blockquote>AI argues that this is problematic because it removes the independence and impartiality that define basic courts. The report notes that international law requires that military courts only have jurisdiction to over cases "directly related to military discipline ... and should not extend to common crimes, human rights violations or crimes under international law, among others." AI detailed multiple cases to show the violations that go unchecked, even when death is the result. The organization listed recommendations as well, with the overarching conclusion being to require cases with civilian victims to be heard in ordinary courts.</p>

<p>In October Chilean <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidenta-2/">President Michelle Bachelet</a> [official profile, in Spanish] announced the government has begun the process of drafting a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/chile-president-announces-process-to-create-new-constitution.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report], with the new draft being presented to Congress in the second half of 2017. The current version of <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~pcwcr/reports/chile1980.html">Chile's Constitution</a> [Princeton backgrounder] was drafted in 1980 and went into effect in 1981 after a vote that was criticized as fraudulent. Last April Bachelet signed a law recognizing civil unions between same-sex couples, a move hailed by advocates as a step toward <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/chile-president-signs-same-sex-civil-union-law.php">full marriage rights</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2228553.pdf">threw out charges</a> [decision, PDF] against Kenyan <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24017899">Deputy President William Ruto</a> [BBC profile]. Ruto and Joshua Sang were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-court-ruto-idUSKCN0X21WC">accused</a> [Reuters report] of supporting murderous inter-ethnic violence in Kenya after the 2007 election, leading to more than 1,200 deaths. Ruto and Sang have <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35965760">denied</a> [BBC report] the murder, deportation and persecution charges. Judges from the ICC <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/pr1205.aspx">halted the trial</a> [press release], ruling that prosecutors failed to provide enough incriminating evidence. The judges ultimately <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc2228555.pdf">were split</a> [dissent, PDF] on whether to acquit, declare a mistrial or continue with the case. The case faced constant setbacks. In February the ICC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35563556">barred the use of recanted testimony</a> [BBC report] after several key witnesses changed their statements. The prosecution alleged that these changes were due to intimidation and bribery on behalf of Ruto. The absence of an acquittal opens up Ruto and Sang for new charges from the ICC in the future.</p>

<p>The ICC's investigation and prosecution of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/pages/situation%20index.aspx">Kenya Situation</a> [ICC backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2010. Last year the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-drops-charges-against-kenyan-president.php">withdrew charges</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who was accused of crimes against humanity for post-election violence, but indicated it would renew the charges if presented with enough evidence. African leaders had <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop cases against Ruto or suspend the charges until African concerns are considered by the court. In response to the charges against Kenyatta and Ruto, the African Union unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/africa-leaders-should-be-immune-from-icc-prosecution-au.php">resolved</a> [JURIST report] in 2013 that African heads of state should be immune from prosecution by the ICC. Also in 2013 Kenya's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kenya-parliament-approves-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">approved a motion</a> [JURIST report] to leave the ICC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2783607-DOJ-Letter-to-Maricopa.html#document/p1">notified</a> [letter] <a href="http://www.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County</a> [official website] officials that it will investigate the issues voters in Arizona's most populous county faced during the March 22 primary election. After the county decided to cut 60 polling locations, lines at the remaining locations were extremely long, with some voters reporting standing in line more than five hours. Phoenix <a href="https://www.phoenix.gov/mayor">Mayor Greg Stanton</a> [official website] requested the DOJ investigation and said the county "distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations." Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Doug Ducey</a> [official website] also wanted an investigation into the long lines. Maricopa County officials stated that they plan to cooperate fully with the DOJ and provide them with all information they are seeking.</p>

<p>Voting issues remain a controversial topic, particularly with the presidential election approaching. On Monday the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-940_ed9g.pdf">ruled unanimously</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/evenwel-v-abbott/">Evenwel v. Abott</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that states may use total population to appropriate state legislative districts, and there is no constitutional requirement that states use voter population in order to divide up <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/us-supreme-court-holds-state-or-locality-may-draw-its-legislative-districts-based-on-total-populatio.php">legislative districts</a> [JURIST report]. Last month the <a href="http://lulac.org/">League of United Latin American Citizens</a> and <a href="https://veasey.house.gov/">Congressman Marc Veasy</a> [official websites], along with other plaintiffs, filed an <a href="http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/sites/default/files/Veasey%20v.%20Abbot%20Application%20to%20Vacate%20Stay%203.25.16.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] with the Supreme Court, asking the court to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/voters-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">vacate a stay</a> [JURIST report] that allowed a Texas voter ID law, said to have racially discriminatory effects, to remain in place. Also in March <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15a911.htm">ordered</a> [text] Montana to respond to the <a href="http://www.mtgop.org/">Montana Republican Party's</a> [party website] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/15A911-application.pdf">application for injunctive relief</a> [application, PDF] requesting the right to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/montana-republicans-urge-supreme-court-to-allow-closed-primary.php">closed primary in the state</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, on Monday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19779&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] on Chilean authorities to implement a sustainable model to education. He <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18558&LangID=E">explained</a> [statement] that "Chile is going through an historic period of transformation to recognize education as a right and not as a commodity" through its implementation of its Inclusive Education Act of June 2015 that progressively and completely eradicated "for-profit" education before 2018. Singh applauded Chile for adopting an "unprecedented" stance toward reforms and that combat high levels of school segregation and stratification. The Special Rapporteur also urged the government of Chile to enact legislation on financing education because of its essential nature to ensure that education is not reduced to a commodity or tainted by corruption and fraud. He said that the "State remains the guardian of the right to education in all circumstances" and focused on the change in Chile from education being driven by neoliberal economic policies and education "restored" as a public service through legislation.</p>

<p>Chile has also begun the process of drafting a new constitution in order to reflect the ideals of democracy and not its dictatorship when the current draft was written. The process <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/chile-president-announces-process-to-create-new-constitution.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in October and the new constitution will be presented to Congress in the second half of 2017. In March 2015 the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-warns-of-pervasive-poverty-in-chile.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that poverty in Chile remained under the radar for many policy-makers in the country. He noted that although Chile serves as a model for much of Latin America in regards to human rights and social policy innovations- it continued to tolerate high levels of inequality and poverty. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report claims that the number of prisoners with psychosocial disabilities in prisons remains high because of a 1994 law that directs courts not to take into account mental health conditions when imposing sentences for offenses committed by individuals whose judgment was altered by a mental health condition. Although the intention of the law, the report says, may have been to treat the state of mind as a mitigating factor "the law was not specific on what the modification should be." The practical implication of the general language is that judges and juries have "tended to view defendants with mental health conditions as more dangerous than those without, and consequently handed down harsher sentences." The report concludes that those who have been handed harsher sanctions because of their perceived dangerousness and not on "objective criteria" have been victims of discrimination on the basis of disability. The advocacy organization <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/05/france-inadequate-mental-health-care-prisons">called</a> [press release] on the French government to commission a new independent study of the mental health of prisoners, to provide appropriate living conditions, to ensure that prisoners with psychosocial disabilities are never put in solitary confinement, and to address the shortage of mental health professionals in prisons and improve their working conditions. </p>

<p>Prisoners are an at-risk population throughout the world. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Louisiana jails are failing to provide basic HIV services to inmates. HRW also found that Baton Rouge and New Orleans&#8212;the state's two largest cities&#8212;lead the nation in HIV infections every year and the state also leads the nation in rates of incarceration. The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] have been matters of ongoing concern in the US with two groups in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">detailing</a> [JURIST report] recommendations for criminal justice reform in that state earlier last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Mississippi Governor <a href="http://www.governorbryant.com/">Phil Bryant</a> [official profile] on Tuesday signed a <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2016/pdf/history/HB/HB1523.xml">bill</a> [HB 1523, materials] into law that will allow state employees to refuse to issue same-sex-marriage licenses and allow private companies and religious groups to deny services to the LGBT community without the threat of punishment. The legislation will also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/mississippi-religion-idUSL2N17818Q">allow</a> [Reuters report] employers to use religion as a reason to establish workplace policies regarding such things as dress codes and bathroom access. Proponents of the bill claim that the law will help protect sincerely held religious and moral beliefs of people who now live in a country where same-sex marriage is legal. Detractors of the law claim that it will allow employers to freely discriminate. The law is not as broad as other religious freedom bills passed by other states recently, but it still specifically protects the beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sex should be reserved to such a marriage and that the words "male" and "female" are "objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at birth."</p>

<p>The intersection of religious liberty and sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. On Thursday Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/arkansas-ag-to-appeal-ruling-upholding-local-anti-discrimination-ordinance.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a judge' s decision upholding a Fayetteville ordinance that protects members of the LGBT community from discrimination. Last month Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a religious freedom bill that critics claim would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=14787">vetoed</a> [press release] a similar bill. Also last month North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper on <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] during a press conference that he will not defend House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. That legislation specifically prohibits local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination ordinances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South African <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17450447">President Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile] on Tuesday survived a vote to impeach him after the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [official website] gave him their support. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the constitutional court ruled that he had ignored their <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">order</a> [JURIST report] to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence. However, his future as president is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/firms-cut-ties-jacob-zuma-allies-before-impeachment-vote">still in question</a> [Guardian report] as many influential figures have maintained their requests for him to resign over other questionable matters. The issue with his residence improvements came to light when several South Africans, including a Member of Parliament, complained to the Public Protector "concerning aspects of the security upgrades" made to the private residence triggering a fairly extensive investigation by the Protector into the Nkandla project. After not paying and the matter of impeachment going to parliament, the ANC decided to back Zuma and used their control of two-thirds of parliament to win the vote against impeachment. </p>

<p>This is not the first time that Zuma has faced controversy in South Africa politics. Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but he was ultimately acquitted and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as African National Congress deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18559&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] about increasing mob violence in Malawi, urging authorities to act to alleviate the situation. Spokesperson Cécile Pouilly expressed particular concern that mob uprisings have successfully been able to attack government buildings and remove individuals from custody. In one instance a man was removed from a police station and killed after he was accused of murder. In a similar instance, a mob set fire to a local court to prevent three accused murderers from receiving bail. The UN is calling for increased government action in response: <blockquote>We urge the authorities in Malawi to act promptly to identify and prosecute those involved in mob killings, and to offer remedy to victims. We also urge the authorities to address the root causes of such attacks and to launch an awareness campaign to encourage people to report crimes to police rather than take justice into their own hands.</blockquote>In recent months, government authorities in Malawi have also spoken out about the increasing violence. In February several members of Parliament claimed that Army forces were <a href="http://www.nyasatimes.com/2016/02/25/mps-accuse-malawi-army-soldiers-for-killing-villagers-at-dzalanyama-forest/">responsible for killing</a> [<em>Nyassa Times</em> report] two villagers and terrorizing communities in Dzalanyama. In Late March <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/16472841-arthur-peter-mutharika">President Arthur Peter Mutharika</a> [Bloomberg profile] called for peace and an end to mob violence when he released the following statement via Facebook.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2015 saw the highest number of recorded executions in more than 25 years, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/Alarming-surge-in-recorded-executions-sees-highest-toll-in-more-than-25-years/">reported</a> [press release] Wednesday. AI records show that at least 1,634 people were executed last year in 25 countries. However, the report also shows that there was a sharp decline in the number of death sentences between 2014 and 2015, falling to 1,998 from 2,466 recorded sentences. Yet at the end of 2015, 20,292 individuals were still waiting to face execution. Most executions take place in China, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the US. However, some countries such as Fiji, Madagascar, the Republic of Congo and Suriname have begun to abolish the death penalty for all crimes while more than 100 limit the practice. </p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and around the world.

		<title>HRW: millions in Bangladesh affected by arsenic poisoning in water</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Bangladesh government has failed to respond adequately to naturally occurring arsenic in rural drinking water, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/04/06/nepotism-and-neglect/failing-response-arsenic-drinking-water-bangladeshs-rural">report</a> [text] Wednesday. The report found that the government's efforts to combat water-contamination has drastically fallen off since 2006. In particular, HRW said there is "little or no ongoing government water testing of wells and monitoring of results at the village level" which has led to the false belief that the issue has been solved. The problem is far from solved, however, as a 2013 study examining drinking water at the point of use found that "12.4 percent of samples exceeded the Bangladesh standard," meaning that there is approximately "20 million people exposed to arsenic above this level." Further, the country's standard of 50 micrograms of arsenic per liter of water is five times higher than the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Heatlh Organization</a>'s (WHO) [official website] guideline of 10 micrograms. HRW found that the country's health system was also failing to address the issue, neglecting to conduct arsenic screening in villages and telling those affected that "nothing can be done for them." According to the report, tens of thousands of individuals affected face death, and millions more face cancer, lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and other serious afflictions. While the government, international donors, and NGO's have installed deep tubewells to reach safer water, "the government [expends] considerable resources in areas where the risk of arsenic contamination is relatively low and where water coverage is relatively good." The report further called upon the government and the <a href="http://www.dphe.gov.bd/">Department of Public Health Engineering</a> [official website] to implement plans and policies to promote safer drinking water for Bangladeshi's.</p>

<p>In March 2010 Bolivian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3203752.stm">President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bolivia-president-urges-un-to-declare.php">called on the UN</a> [JURIST report] to declare access to safe drinking water a basic human right and introduced a resolution to that effect. In July of that year, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/un-declares-access-to-safe-drinking-water-a-basic-human-right.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/ga10967.doc.htm">resolution</a> [materials] declaring that access to clean and sanitized drinking water is a basic human right. The resolution passed by a vote of 122-0. One of the <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a> [official website] to reduce social and economic harms by 2015 includes decreasing by half the number of people who cannot reach or afford safe drinking water and do not have basic sanitation. The resolution expressed concern that approximately 884 million people are without access to safe drinking water and more than 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three UN human rights experts on Wednesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19784&LangID=E">urged</a> [statement] Mexican authorities to support human rights groups who are facing extreme criticism in national media. UN <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders</a> [official website] Michel Forst said that the <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/countries/LACRegion/Pages/MXIndex.aspx">Mexican government</a> [UN backgrounder] should recognize that the defense of human rights is a legitimate national interest and serves to strengthen the stability of the nation as a whole. The statement comes on the heels of recent media criticism of national human rights organizations, non-profit organizations, and international human rights organizations which has served to decrease the climate for the promotion and protecting of human rights in the country.</p>

<p>Mexico has received criticism from multiple human rights organizations for its handling of human rights abuses, as forced disappearances and military violence have come to international attention. In 2015 <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/28/mexico-police-killings-michoacan">reported</a> [press release] that there is evidence of recent unlawful police killings in Mexico. The report suggests that police action which left eight civilians dead in the city of Apatzingán on January 6, and 42 civilians and one police officer dead in Tanhuato on May 22 was an "excessive use of force against unarmed civilians." That same year, the <a href="http://centroprodh.org.mx/en/">Miguel Agustin Pro human rights center</a> [official website] in Mexico announced that there is evidence that high-ranking Mexican officers gave soldiers orders to kill criminals prior to an army mass slaying of suspected cartel members in June 2014. In 2013 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-to-increase-human-rights-protections-reduce-military-in-policing.php">urged Mexico's government</a> [JURIST report] to better protect against human rights abuses, specifically with respect to the military's use of force against civilians.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/838651/download">civil antitrust lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday to block <a href="http://www.halliburton.com/en-US/default.page">Halliburton's</a> proposed acquisition of <a href="http://www.bakerhughes.com">Baker Hughes, Inc.</a> [corporate websites]. The two companies are giants in the oilfield services industry and together would comprise a majority of oil-related business. The DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-block-halliburton-s-acquisition-baker-hughes">alleges</a> [press release] that the transaction threatens to eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation in the oilfield services industry. According to the suit, the proposed purchase of Baker Hughes, Inc. would violate <a href="http://www.antitrustinstitute.org/sites/default/files/Section%207.pdf">Section 7 of the Clayton Act</a> [text, PDF] because it would combine two of the three largest providers of oilfield services providers in the world. </p>

<p>Suits alleging monopolies have become commonplace of recent, as many of the world's largest companies have faced <a href="/feature/featured/antitrust/">antitrust charges</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US and internationally. In 2015 the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/eu-officials-open-antitrust-investigation-regarding-online-shopping.php">opened an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into potential antitrust violations in the e-commerce market with the scope of the investigation including a number of the world's largest technology and search companies. The prior month, the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/eu-initiates-antitrust-proceedings-against-google.php">initiated antitrust proceedings against Google</a> [JURIST report] accusing the company of utilizing its dominant position in the search engine market to hurt competitors. Earlier that year a judge for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-dismisses-google-antitrust-suit.php">dismissed a class action suit against Google</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly monopolizing search engines in Android phones. In 2014 a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California approved a settlement<a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-judge-approves-settlement-in-ebay-antitrust-case.php"> between federal antitrust authorities and eBay</a> [JURIST report] over allegations that eBay agreed to not to selectively recruit and hire employees from rival companies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/index.html">Governor CL "Butch" Otter</a> [official website], issued his first veto of 2016 on Tuesday, striking <a href="http://legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2016/S1342Bookmark.htm">legislation</a> [SB1342] that provided for the use of the Christian Bible in public school. The legislation explicitly allowed the Bible to be referenced in various subjects including literature, biology, geography, comparative government and history. The bill would not require students to use the religious text, and stated that it did not mean to "permit religious or doctrinal instruction." Otter <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4044f58c7bfe46e4825e91eb276841c9/governor-vetoes-bill-permitting-use-bible-schooling">explained his veto</a> [AP report] saying the legislation was in violation of the <a href="https://www.legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/IC/Title003.htm">Idaho state constitution</a> [text].</p>

<p>The boundaries of the First Amendment's <a href="/feature/featured/the-establishment-clause/">Establishment Clause</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial in the US. In 2014 Virginia's governor <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/virginia-governor-vetoes-school-prayer-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have codified the rights of students to pray voluntarily in school and at school events. Also that year the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/massachusetts-top-court-rules-pledge-of-allegiance-not-discriminatory.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Pledge of Allegiance's words "under God" do not discriminate against non-religious people since the language is patriotic and not religious. Also in 2014 the US Supreme Court ruled that the practice of <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-rules-prayer-allowed-at-town-meetings.php">opening town meetings with a prayer</a> [JURIST report] does not violate the Establishment Clause</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Puerto Rico legislature <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/web/actividadlegislativa/tramitelegislativo.aspx?measureid=59909">passed a bill</a> [materials, in Spanish] on Wednesday that would allow the island territory to enter into a state of fiscal emergency and begin the process toward a debt moratorium. The <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/Documents/Measures/7c856cb0-7ac2-495a-8a29-b12c13edbe2f.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] would allow the moratorium, primarily concerned with the debt of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, to be in effect for nearly a year. At this point, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla has yet to sign the measure. The opposition has expressed that <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bbe7ca7747ef40bcbe58c9bad0f4af06/puerto-rico-legislators-approve-bill-debt-moratorium">challenges to the constitutionality</a> [AP report] of the bill are forthcoming.</p>

<p>At the end of 2015, Puerto Rico was $70 billion dollars in debt. The governor anticipated a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-28/which-puerto-rico-bond-defaults-next-42-yields-provide-a-clue">government default</a> [Bloomberg report] in 2016, which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/business/dealbook/puerto-rico-defaults-on-debt-payments.html?_r=0">came to fruition</a> [NYT report] on January 4. The territory has been suffering from a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35368786">massive recession</a> [BBC report] since 2006, nearly a decade before Padilla announced that Puerto Rico was unable to pay its debts. However, the Puerto Rico Electronic Power Authority, a major player in the economic crisis, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-24/puerto-rico-electric-wins-debt-restructuring-deal-with-creditors">reached a deal</a> [Bloomberg report] to restructure its debt in December. This deal is the first of many restructuring plans to alleviate the government's debt. In February, the Puerto Rico Legislature <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/Documents/Measures/66728140-f770-48c7-bb47-660163e60d49.pdf">passed a bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] that would restructure the island's <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/puerto-rico-could-pass-debt-restructuring-bill.php">estimated $9 billion debt</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://attorneygeneral.tn.gov/">Tennessee Attorney General </a>[official website] on Wednesday issued an <a href="http://attorneygeneral.tn.gov/op/2016/op16-13.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] that states that fantasy sports amounts to illegal gambling within the state. Attorney General Herbert Slatery said in his opinion that all fantasy sports games, including those on daily sports sites such as FanDuel and DraftKings, are illegal within the state. The opinion also says that fantasy players win mostly by chance rather than skill when choosing teams and athletes in numerous game formats. The AG went on to argue that, "absent legislation specifically exempting fantasy sports contests from the definition of 'gambling,' these contests constitute illegal gambling under Tennessee law." Many fantasy sports websites have issued [<em>Tennessean</em> report] against the opinion, claiming that it is improper and unfounded. </p>

<p>Many officials have stated that online fantasy sports may be an illegal form of gambling. <a href="http://ag.hawaii.gov/">Hawaii Attorney</a> General Doug Chin [official website] released an advisory opinion in January<a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hawaii-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php"> declaring</a> [JURIST report] that daily fantasy sports websites in which players pay to participate are considered gambling and are therefore illegal in the state. Also in January Texas Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/texas-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php">declared </a>[JURIST report] daily fantasy sports websites illegal within the state. Earlier that month the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/new-york-court-allows-daily-sports-fantasy-websites-to-continue-operating.php">granted </a>[JURIST report] FanDuel and Draftkings a stay allowing them to continue to operate within the state during their appeal. In August the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit </a>[official website] ruled against New Jersey, deciding 2-1 <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ban-on-sports-betting.php">to uphold</a> [JURIST report] the federal ban on sports betting in all but four states. In December 2011 the <a href="http://www.doj.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] clarified its stance on <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/doj-finds-online-non-sports-gambling-lawful.php">online gambling</a> [JURIST report] in a memorandum opinion holding online non-sports related gambling that crosses state or international borders is not covered by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-75/pdf/STATUTE-75-Pg491.pdf">Wire Act of 1961</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">French Parliament</a> [official website] on Wednesday passed legislation which will make it illegal to pay for sex within the nation. The new law will punish those who solicit prostitutes by issuing  fines and ordering the completion of mandatory classes about the harmful effects of prostitution. It is reported that the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/french-lawmakers-vote-punishing-prostitutes-clients-38186358">fine </a>[AP report] for the first offence will be 1,500 euros and 3,750 euros for the second. The new law against prostitution was passed with 64 votes in favor and 12 votes abstained. The bill was initially introduced in 2013 but the vote has been delayed for several years due to numerous hearings on the proposed legislation. </p>

<p>Other countries have also attempted to outlaw portions of the prostitution trade. Last week, the Constitutional Court of South Korea [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-korea-court-upholds-anti-prostitution-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that punishes individual sex workers. The South Korean high court called prostitution "violent and exploitative in nature," and that it therefore could not be non-coercive. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> (OSCJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Canada's anti-prostitution laws, citing the danger they generate for sex workers. In Canada, prostitution itself is legal even though many ancillary acts are not. In 2011, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada </a>[official website] agreed to review a <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">British Columbia Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision<a href="/paperchase/2011/03/canada-high-court-to-review-anti-prostitution-laws.php"> allowing a challenge </a>[JURIST report] to the country's anti-prostitution laws. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, Taiwanese] of Taiwan ruled that a law <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/taiwan-high-court-rules-prostitution.php">penalizing prostitutes</a> [JURIST report] and not their clients was unconstitutional because it undermined equality under the country's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verPrincipal.php?idioma=en_us">Brazilian Supreme Federal Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday ordered the <a href="http://www.congressonacional.leg.br/portal/">legislature</a> [official website] to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer. Judge Marco Aurelio Mello <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35970615">overruled</a> [BBC report] a previous rejection from a high ranking member of the Brazilian legislature. Brazil is in the midst of a political and economic crisis, tied to widespread corruption. Impeachment proceedings are already underway for Brazil's current president, Dilma Rousseff. Until recently, Temer was viewed as the likely successor to Rousseff, and he has met with a number of political officials in recent months to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/world/americas/brazil-impeach-ruling-michel-temer-dilma-rousseff.html?_r=0">discuss the structure of a new government</a> [NYT report]. The impeachment proceedings against Temer <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/brazil-vice-president-michel-temer-impeachment-dilma-rousseff">accuse him of the same charges</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] levied against Rousseff, including the manipulation of national budget figures. The decision on Rousseff's impeachment is expected mid-month. The ruling to initiate impeachment proceedings against Temer can be appealed against and overruled by a majority vote by the full Supreme Court.  </p>

<p><a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Brazil&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Brazil's political establishment</a> [JURIST news archive] has experienced turmoil of late as many powerful politicians, including former presidents, face allegations of corruption and misappropriation of state assets. Earlier this month a judge for the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-high-court-judge-upholds-order-barring-appointment-of-ex-president.php">upheld a ruling</a> [JURIST report] blocking former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking a ministry post. Lula was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-ex-president-lula-charged-with-money-laundering.php">charged with money laundering and misrepresentation of assets</a> [JURIST report] involving a luxury apartment in the beachfront city of Guarujá. In December, Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">ruled on two measures to set the stage for impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://kyushu.com/fukuoka/govt_offices/high_court/">Fukuoka High Court</a> [backgrounder] on Wednesday rejected an appeal filed by citizens of Japan seeking to stop the operation of the only two remaining nuclear reactors in the country. The suit was originally <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-wp-japan-nuclear-72a50e42-fc04-11e5-80e4-c381214de1a3-20160406-story.html">raised by 12 residents</a> [Japan News report] in the Kagoshima District Court in April 2015. Wednesday's decision upholds the ruling from last year. The No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/japan-restarts-second-reactor-sendai-nuclear-plant-1524106">were restarted in August and October 2015</a> [IB Times report]. The Fukuoka High Court emphasized that reactors at the Sendai plant adhere to more stringent safety measures that were enacted following the Fukushima No. 1 disaster in 2011. The reactors in question are the first to be restarted following the adoption of new safety standards by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. In rejecting the challenge, president judge Tomoichiro Nishikawa stated there is "no concrete risk that the plaintiffs and others would suffer serious damage." The plaintiffs may be able to seek appellate review with the Japanese supreme court.   </p>

<p>Japan's <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/japan-court-allows-nuclear-reactors-to-reopen.php">court system</a> [JURIST report] and legislature has faced a number of legal issues related to the Fukushima disaster that occurred five years ago. Earlier in March, the Otsu District Court in Japan <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/japan-court-orders-two-nuclear-reactors-closed.php">ordered an injunction halting the operation of two nuclear reactors</a> [JURIST report], days before the fifth anniversary of the Fukuishima nuclear disaster. In February court-appointed prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/japan-prosecutors-charge-former-utility-executives-with-neglect-over-fukushima-disaster.php">charged three former utility executives</a> [JURIST report] with counts of negligence in relation to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster. In August 2012 Japanese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-prosecutors-initiate-criminal-investigation-into-fukushima-nuclear-disaster.php">opened  a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the power plant meltdown after more than 1,300 people <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/criminal-complaint-filed-against-japan-nuclear-plant-executives.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a criminal complaint against <a href="http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/index-e.html?">Tokyo Electric Power Company</a> (TEPCO) [official website] for causing the catastrophe and the resulting radiation. The complaint came two months after an expert panel <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/expert-panel-claims-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-crisis-was-preventable.php">reported that the disaster was preventable</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2012 a group of <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/japan-power-company-shareholders-suing-over-fukushima-nuclear-crisis.php">TEPCO shareholders filed a USD $67 billion lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the company for failing to prevent the disaster. In August 2011 five months after the meltdown, Japan's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/japan-lawmakers-approve-fukushima-victim-compensation-plan.php">legislature voted to create a fund for victims of the disaster</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Advocate General of the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm">Court of Justice of the European Union</a> (CJEU) [official website], Melchior Wathelet, <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=Playboy&docid=175626&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=745573#ctx1">stated</a> [advisory opinion] on Thursday that providing a hyperlink to images without the owner's consent does not amount to copyright infringement. The case involves a website, GreenStijl, which posted hyperlinks to another website's unlawfully posted Playboy pictures. Wathelet stated that "hyperlinks which lead, even directly, to protected works do not 'make available' those works to a public where the works are already freely accessible" on other websites. More specifically, he claimed that hyperlinks do not constitute a 'communication to the public' as defined by <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:167:0010:0019:EN:PDF">Directive 2001/29/EC</a> [text, PDF], which would make the information a copyright infringement. To interpret hyperlinks as such, Wathelet stated, would impair the "functioning of the Internet and...one of the main objectives of [the act], namely the development of the information society in Europe." He expressed fear that ruling contrary to this interpretation would open up individuals to copyright proceedings and would thus be severely detrimental to the continuing proliferation and exchange of information on the internet. </p>

<p>If the Advocate General's argument is heeded, the precedent would be an expansion upon previous European and US copyright law. In September of 2014, the EU Court of Justice <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/09/european-court-allows-library-to-digitize-but-not-disseminate-works.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that libraries could make works digital without consent of the copyright holders. In June 2014, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-searchable-book-database-constitutes-fair-use.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that searchable book databases constituted fair use and thus did not violate copyright infringement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icty.org">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://www.icty.org/en/about/office-of-the-prosecutor/the-prosecutor">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] announced on Wednesday that he will <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53625#.VwZx3GN-_ow">appeal</a> [press release] the recent acquittal of Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/icty-acquits-serbian-nationalist-seselj-of-all-balkan-war-crimes.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party and former Assembly member of Serbia, of all crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Balkan war on March 31. Brammertz believes that the Hague-based court failed to perform its judicial function by failing to properly apply the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard. He further stated that the majority erred in determining that the criminal conduct was a lawful contribution to the war effort. Brammertz claims that the evidence provided to the court was overwhelming and the vast number of crimes was overlooked.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">ICTY</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. In May 2015 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icty-orders-serbia-to-return-seselj-to-detention.php">ordered </a>[JURIST report] Serbia's justice ministry to return Šešelj to his detention cell immediately after he was <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">released in February </a>[JURIST op-ed] to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. The ICTY had revoked his <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March because Šešelj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to the Hague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/07/iraq-fallujah-siege-starving-population">called on</a> [press release] Iraqi forces to allow aid such as food and medicine into Fallujah as the armed siege is producing acute shortages. The city has found itself besieged by governmental forces since the Islamic State (ISIS) made it a territorial strong hold in 2014. HRW is calling on the Iraqi forces to allow aid into the city and also asking ISIS to allow the sick and starving residents to evacuate the city. Due to the siege, HRW is relying on local activist to report information as they are not able to reach the city and have gathered that, "[w]hat little food remains is being sold at exorbitant prices. A 50-kilogram sack of flour goes for US$750, and a bag of sugar for $500[.]" As the possibility of mass starvation continues, local activist and residents are using social media in the hopes of raising awareness of the growing crisis which has yet to amount to international priority. </p>

<p>ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and simply the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder], has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria due to their involvements of civilians as a tool of war. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry, in a speech at the State Department, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">declared </a>[JURIST report] that the Islamic State "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/04/06/14-15143.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] summary judgment issued by a Hawaii federal district court denying an exemption to <a href="http://nativeamericanchurches.org">Oklevueha Native American Church of Hawaii, Inc.</a> [official website] from federal laws prohibiting the possession and distribution of cannabis. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/court-native-american-church-not-excused-from-cannabis-laws/2016/04/06/3457e894-fc63-11e5-813a-90ab563f0dde_story.html">case arose</a> [AP report] from an incident in 2009 involving a member of the church who had his cannabis seized prompting the church to file a complaint under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Controlled Substances Act. The Ninth Circuit stated "even assuming that plaintiffs' use of cannabis constituted an 'exercise of religion,' no rational trier of fact could conclude on the record that a prohibition of cannabis use imposed a 'substantial burden' on plaintiffs' exercise of religion." Since the church failed to prove the required burden, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's denial from exemption. The founder of the Church, Michael Rex "Raging Bear" Mooney expressed his disappointment over the decision, and Mooney's attorney, Michael Glenn, stated that the church intends to appeal the ruling. </p>

<p>In recent years there has been a movement to decriminalize marijuana both domestically and abroad which has resulted in at least <a href="http://money.cnn.com/interactive/news/economy/marijuana-legalization-map/">20 US states allowing various forms of medical marijuana and four states decriminalizing</a> [CNN report] marijuana altogether. In February the Utah Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/utah-senate-advances-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php"> voted to advance a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize the use of medical marijuana in various forms such as vapor or edible form. In December Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] fully legalizing medical marijuana in the country. Last November New York Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-york-governor-signs-emergency-medical-marijuana-bills.php">signed two bills</a> [JURIST report] in order to expedite the distribution of medical marijuana to citizens with critical health conditions. Earlier that month New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill-allowing-medical-marijuana-on-school-grounds-for-disabled-students.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that would allow for the administering of edible medical marijuana to sick and disabled children on school grounds without triggering the arrests of parents or educators. In June of last year the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a law <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">restricting the use of medical marijuana was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In August, JURIST guest columnist, Nancy Marcus, <a href="/forum/2015/08/nancy-marcus-religious-freedom.php">discussed</a> [JURIST Op-ed] religious freedom claims by members of Native American churches seeking drug law exemptions for use of peyote during religious ceremonies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday agreed to hear an appeal by <a href="https://www.uber.com/?nav=b">Uber</a> [official website] of a federal district court order that certified a class of nearly 160,000 drivers in California who challenge their status as independent contractors. Uber's attorneys <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-0406-uber-lawsuit-20160405-story.html">argue</a> [LAT report] that the drivers signed away their right to participate in class-action lawsuits due to a binding arbitration clause in their agreement with Uber. However, District Judge Edward Chen certified the class action last September finding that the arbitration agreements were unenforceable. Uber has consistently maintained that the arbitration clause in the driver contracts is the only avenue for any remedy or resolution that the drivers may seek. A jury trial was initially scheduled for June 20, but if Uber succeeds in its appeal, the entire structure of the lawsuit may change, involving far fewer plaintiffs than originally planned. </p>

<p>With the rapid growth of companies like <a href="https://www.lyft.com">Lyft</a> [official website] and Uber, ride-sharing services have been among the <a href="/feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">most controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. App-based ride-sharing services have been both praised for their successful implementation and criticized for their uncertain position in transportation regulation. In several states, ride-sharing companies have met significant legal opposition, frequently led by competitors such as the taxi industry. Other <a href="/feature/2015/11/future-of-ride-sharing.php">unresolved questions</a> [JURIST backgrounder] surrounding this new business model continue to prompt debate among lawmakers. Although some cities and states, such as California, have developed <a href="http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2015/07/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new?slreturn=1460045926">new laws</a> [PC360 report] mandating certain insurance for ride-sharing drivers, others have resisted. Officials in Buffalo, for example, <a href="http://www.wkbw.com/news/future-of-ride-sharing-in-buffalo">find the lack of insurance regulation</a> [ABC report] in this industry too unsafe, so prohibit ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber from operating inside the city. In fact, the Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-joint-settlement-lyft">sued</a> [press release] Lyft for operating in violation of local regulations in Rochester and Buffalo, resulting in a $300,000 settlement. Further controversy surrounds the potential threat to taxi-drivers and companies, a threat that has also sparked litigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/04/255568.htm">reminded</a> [press release] Bahrain to regard human rights as essential amid growing international concern that the government is engaging in sectarian discrimination.  The secretary made the remarks in a joint press conference with <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bh/AboutBahrain/Goverment/HHthePrimeMinister/tabid/138/language/en-US/Default.aspx">Prime Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa</a> [official website] after the two officials had a private discussion. Kerry is <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/travel/2016/t10/index.htm">in the region</a> [trip summary] to discuss specific aspects of the <a href="https://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/indexfc7a.html">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> [official website], which includes free trade agreements and cooperation with Iran. While in Bahrain, Kerry discussed the growing opportunities for military cooperation as well as strengthening economic ties. He also took the time to bring awareness to sectarian violence involving the Shi'te community:<blockquote>In addition, the foreign minister and I have a chance to discuss the ongoing effort to address and to reduce sectarian divisions here in Bahrain and elsewhere, and I appreciate the seriousness with which he considers this issue. We all welcome steps by all sides to create conditions that will provide for greater political involvement for the citizens of this great country. And here, as in all nations, we believe that respect for human rights and an inclusive political system are essential in order to allow citizens to be able to reach and live out their full potential.</blockquote>The prime minister welcomed the discussion and expressed concern for ensuring the growing conflict with Iran is addressed.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Bahrain is considered an ally of the US but has faced growing international concerns about its human rights practices. Bahraini authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bahrain-authorities-detain-4-us-journalists.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] four US journalists covering the five-year anniversary of the nation's 2011 uprising and formally charged them in February. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/02/bahrain-hopes-for-justice-and-reform-fading-five-years-since-2011-uprising/">reported</a> [text] in February that nearly five years after <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12471243">Bahrain's Day of Rage</a> [BBC report] protests <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-bahrain-rights-reform-outlook-bleak.php">sparked</a> [JURIST report] international concern over Bahraini government accountability in human rights, the hope for reform has dwindled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert in a <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000153-ed9a-d0e4-af73-efbb4acb0001">sentencing memorandum</a> [text, PDF] filed on Wednesday <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/dennis-hastert-probation-prison-221653">urged the court</a> [Politico report] to spare him jail time and impose a sentence of probation. The memorandum first acknowledged Hastert's past actions and stated that he was "deeply sorry" for such actions before discussing how throughout his life he has been committed to service and "enriched the lives of so many." The memorandum then highlighted the importance of his family and how his prior actions affected his relationship with his family and friends. The memorandum concluded discussing how Hastert's health has been declining, finally asking the judge to impose probation instead of jail time. Hastert is scheduled for sentencing on April 27.</p>

<p>Hastert <a href="http://time.com/4090516/dennis-hastert-plea-deal-2/">pleaded guilty</a> [TIME report] to charges of money laundering in connection with a hush-money scheme where it was alleged that Hastert was involved in sexual misconduct during his time as a high school teacher. An investigation by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> indicated that at least <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dennis-hastert-investigation-met-20160406-story.html">four people have made "credible allegations" against Hastert</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report]. While Hastert has not come confirmed the allegations of sexual abuse, the memorandum noted that Hastert "regrets that he resorted to structuring the withdrawal of his money from banks in an effort to prevent the disclosure of that misconduct [...]" and that he "apologize[d] to his family, friends, former constituents, and all others affected by his misconduct."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kansas <a href="http://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="http://governor.ks.gov/media-room/media-releases/2016/04/07/governor-sam-brownback-issues-statement-after-signing-bill-to-keep-kansas-schools-open">signed</a> [press release] a <a href="http://governor.ks.gov/docs/default-source/documents/april-2016-hb-2655-signing-statement.pdf?sfvrsn=4">bill</a> (HB 2665) [text, PDF] on Thursday enacting a new funding formula for schools. The bill replaces a formula that was found to be unconstitutional by the state <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/kansas-courts/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/kansas-court-rules-school-funding-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in February that the previous funding system was inequitable. Justices on the court gave the Kansas legislature until June 30 before they closed schools due to the failed funding measures. The legislation <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/kansas-education-idUSL2N17A1B2">appropriates</a> [Reuters report] $367 million in supplemental general state aid under a new formula that assessed the value of property within a district on a per pupil basis. The legislation also ensures that no school district will have its current level of funding reduces.</p>

<p>Public schools across the nation faced <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/obama-signs-bill-revising-no-child-left-behind.php">restructuring</a> [JURIST report] last December, and that could mean more work for the Kansas legislature. Early that month President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/12/10/statement-press-secretary-s-1177">signed</a> [press release] the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114s1177eah/pdf/BILLS-114s1177eah.pdf">Every Student Succeeds Act</a> [text, PDF] into law. The new measures hand much of the power over education success monitoring back to the states. The Every Student Succeeds Act revises the 2001 <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/index.html">No Child Left Behind Act</a> (NCLB) [materials] and removes the accountability measures for standardized test scores that had been set by the federal government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani authorities opened a probe on Thursday into reports that a charity run by a militant group has established an Islamic court. The group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/lashkar-e-taiba-army-pure-aka-lashkar-e-tayyiba-lashkar-e-toiba-lashkar--taiba/p17882">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR profile] has reportedly established a court separate from the judiciary in Lahore. Legal experts in the area claim that such a system is illegal and unconstitutional. This type of Tabilban style court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/04/07/world/asia/ap-as-pakistan-islamic-court.html?_r=0">is rare</a> [NYT report] in Pakistan's heartland, but has become common in northwestern tribal regions. A spokesperson for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/10334914">Jamaat-ud-Dawa</a> [BBC profile], the charity in question, stated that the court is not a parallel judicial system, but rather an arbitration service. LeT is suspected of carrying out the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/asia/mumbai-terror-attacks/">2008 Mumbai terror attacks</a> [CNN profile].</p>

<p>Mumbai has suffered a number of terrorist attacks allegedly linked to the LeT in recent years, leading the government to consider <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/india-government-urged-to-revive.php">controversial terrorism laws</a> and to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/india-to-use-special-courts-for-mumbai.php">institute special courts</a> [JURIST reports] to try suspects. <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/mumbai-attacks-witness-cross-examined.php">Cross-examination</a> [JURIST report] of the Pakistani-based businessman responsible for selling the boat engine used by the LeT in the attacks began in November 2013. The year prior, India executed the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/29/timeline-the-trial-of-mohammed-ajmal-kasab/">Mohammad Ajmal Kasab</a> [WSJ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=kasab&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">news archive</a>]. In August 2009 India sentenced three terrorists to death for their part in <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/india-court-sentences-mumbai-bombers-to.php">similar attacks in 2003</a> [JURIST report]. In July of that year India announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-trial-to-continue.php">continue the trial</a> [JURIST report] of a man suspected in a 2008 hotel attack that killed more than 100 people, despite his <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-stops.php">mid-trial confession</a> [JURIST report]. Pakistan has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/pakistan-court-begins-trial-of-5-mumbai.php">postponed the trial of five others</a> [JURIST report] allegedly connected with the 2008 attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Courts in Belgium heard cases on Thursday concerning the attacks in Paris. One of the <a href="http://abcnewsradioonline.com/world-news/paris-and-brussels-terror-suspects-due-in-court.html">hearings</a> [ABC News report] concerned whether Salah Abdeslam would be remanded in custody before being transferred to the French government. Last week following a court decision in Brussels, Belgium, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/belgium-to-extradite-terror-suspect-to-france.php">authorities agreed to extradite Paris attack</a> [JURIST report] suspect Abdeslam to France. </p>

<p>The attacks in Paris began on November 13, 2015, with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France around 9:20 PM local time. Soon thereafter, individuals riding in a Seat brand car opened fire on individuals outside cafes around Paris. At around 9:40 PM, assailants fired on concert-goers at the Bataclan concert hall, killing 89. Molins related that these individuals were using "war-type weapons" and explosives, further indicating association with the Islamic State. Speaking about the attacks generally, French President François Hollande<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34820016"> called</a> [BBC report] them "an act of war," and vowed that the French "will lead the fight, and we will be ruthless."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] stated on Thursday that European Union states are violating international law by breaking their migrant pact with Turkey, by not allowing the country to extradite suspected terrorists. Speaking at a ceremony in the capital Ankara, Erdogan <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/second-ferry-leaves-lesbos-for-turkey-eu-migrant-deal">threatened</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to terminate the migrant deal if the EU does not abide by the agreed upon conditions. Erdogan further <a href="http://www.worldbulletin.net/turkeys-erdogan-accuses-eu-states-of-breaking-extradition-law/171361/turkeys-erdogan-accuses-eu-states-of-breaking-extradition-law">clarified</a> [World Bulletin report] that Turkey will not freely accept all immigrants from Greece. Rather, immigrants will be exchanged for Syrian refugees residing in Turkey on a one-to-one basis. Upon resettling 72,000 Syrian refugees, the terms of the EU agreement will be renegotiated. The migrant pact took affect on Monday, however deportations were suspended for four days due to complications with managing migrants. Deportations have resumed and 120 migrants have been ferried from Greece to Turkey. </p>

<p>In March EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Under the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-offers-deal-to-turkey-to-take-back-migrants/2016/03/18/809d80ba-ebab-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html">terms of the deal</a> [WP report], all migrants crossing the Aegean into Greece would be sent back to Turkey, effectively turning the country into the region's "migrant holding center." In return for receiving the migrants, the EU is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ">promising</a> [Reuters report] to speed disbursement of €3 billion to Turkey, while offering an additional €3 billion by 2018 contingent upon creation of plans qualifying for EU assistance. That same month, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c8.html">Filippo Grandi </a>[official profile], <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/56dec2e99.html">expressed concerns</a> [statement, text] for the then proposed <a href="paperchase/2016/03/un-eu-migrant-exchange-with-turkey-possibly-illegal.php">migrant exchange program</a> [JURIST report] between the EU and Turkey. Grandi said in his speech before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website], "I am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law." <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] (AI) also <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/eu-turkey-summit-eu-and-turkish-leaders-deal-death-blow-to-the-right-to-seek-asylum">demonstrated concern</a> [press release] over the deal, calling it "an alarmingly short-sighted and inhumane attitude to handling this crisis."Earlier this month the AI <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/amnesty-turkey-forcibly-returning-syria-refugees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey has been forcibly returning up to 100 refugees to Syria per day and expressed concern for the possible future of transported migrants. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/collyer">U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer</a> [official profile] on Thursday unsealed an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2793065-MetLife-Opinion.html">opinion</a> [text] from late March ruling that the government did not have grounds to designate the major insurance company, <a href="https://www.metlife.com/">Metlife</a> [official website], as "too big to fail." The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx">Financial Stability Oversight Council </a>(FSOC) [official website] <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/04/07/u-s-failed-to-justify-how-metlife-is-too-big-to-fail-judge-says/">determined</a> [WP report] in 2014 that financial distress at Metlife could significantly affect the national economy and therefore the company deserves increased federal scrutiny. Collyer held, however, that such a designation was unsupported by substantial evidence and disregards the costs that Metlife will inevitably suffer. While opponents of financial reform have praised the ruling, <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0410.aspx">stated</a> [official statement] that the ruling may hinder the FSOC's ability to prevent another national financial crisis. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> [official website] is expected to appeal the ruling if it is not overturned. </p>

<p>Currently only four firms- AIG, Prudential, General Electric, and MetLife- have been labeled "too big to fail" by the FSOC. The FSOC was established under the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/html/PLAW-111publ203.htm">Dodd-Frank Act</a> [text] , which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php#.U0WHOq1dV94">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 in response to the 2008 financial collapse and created new regulations designed to strengthen oversight of the financial industry and protect consumers. The Act also established the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm">Commodities Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) [official website] to regulate the derivatives market. Additionally the Act gives the Federal Reserve new oversight over the largest financial institutions. JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/louise-bennetts">Louise Bennetts</a> [official profile] of the Cato Institute <a href="/hotline/2013/01/louise-bennetts-dodd-frank.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Dodd-Frank is a poorly drafted statute with unclear principles that gives regulators too much discretion to promulgate rules. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu-in.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-indiana-kentucky">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy websites] of Indiana filed suit against the state of Indiana on Thursday, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2792982/ACLU-Planned-Parenthood.pdf">challenging</a> [complaint, PDF] the constitutionality of a recently-signed <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2016/bills/house/1337#document-51b52d50">abortion law</a> [bill, PDF] that would prevent abortions sought due to genetic abnormalities. The ALCU and Planned Parenthood are also seeking an injunction on the law until after this lawsuit is settled. The advocacy groups argue that the woman, not the state should determine whether or not to obtain an abortion, and that the state of Indiana is invading privacy. The law bans a woman from receiving an abortion even in circumstances where it is medically determined that the fetus will not survive, but permits abortions for any reason in the first trimester. The law also mandates that the only way to dispose of an aborted fetus is through burial or cremation. </p>

<p>Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. In March a district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-halts-arkansas-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pill.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Arkansas from enforcing a bill mandating abortion pill providers follow US <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] guidelines and requiring hospital admittance privileges to handle complications. Also in March, West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. Later that month, South Dakota passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] that bans abortions after 20 weeks. In February the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/oklahoma-supreme-court-upholds-medication-abortion-restrictions.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision upholding a law that restricts use of medication abortion drugs. In November the US Supreme Court granted <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/post-2.php"><em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to decide whether a Texas law, which requires that clinics have similar facilities to surgical center, posed an undue burden on the availability of abortion on the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress introduced a <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6306823/307378123-Burr-Encryption-Bill-Discussion-Draft.0.pdf">new bill</a> [draft bill, PDF] on Friday which will force smartphone manufacturers to decrypt data in response to law enforcement demands. The bill was proposed by senators Diane Feinstein and Richard Burr, and states that companies "must provide in a timely manner responsive, intelligible information or data, or appropriate technical assistance to obtain such information." However, the bill does not include any criminal penalties for a company's failure to comply. There are severe hurdles that need to be overcome in order for the bill to gain approval, and the Obama Administration has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-legislation-idUSKCN0X32M4">declined to support the bill</a> [Reuters report]. Security experts have <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11203928/feinstein-burr-encryption-bill-required-to-unlock-data">criticized</a> [The Verge report] the bill's language as being "so broad as to target ancillary forms of encryption covering web traffic or credit card data, far beyond its intended scope."</p>

<p>This development comes in the face of a bitter conflict between federal authorities and technology giant Apple over the government's demands to unlock an encrypted iPhone owned by the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/us/san-bernardino-shooting/">San Bernardino shooter</a> [CNN report] Syed Rizwan Farook. The US Department of Justice <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/19/business/document-motion-to-compel-apple-compliance.html?_r=1">filed a motion</a> [text] in February in the US District Court for the Central District of California to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-motion-to-compel-apple-to-unlock-shooters-phone.php">compel Apple to unlock</a> [JURIST report] the said smartphone, after Apple rejected repeated requests from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to do so. Apple subsequently filed a <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/25/468143901/apple-court-filing-calls-iphone-order-dangerous-unconstitutional">brief</a> [text, NPR] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-files-objections-to-order-to-unlock-iphone.php">opposing the government's request</a> [JURIST report], citing First and Fifth Amendment concerns, while its biggest competitor Google <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/google-ceo-backs-apple-fbi-fight-over-cracking-san-bernardino-n520421">joined its side</a> [NBC news report] in opposing the government's motion. However, the entire dispute came to an untimely and unexpected end when the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-drops-case-against-apple-aftering-unlocking-iphone.php">DOJ managed to successfully decrypt the phone</a> [JURIST report] by its own efforts and dropped the case. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The South Africa <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/index.html">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Friday filed for leave to appeal the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/304823348/Final-Judgment-in-al-Bashir-case">unfavorable judgment</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/sca/">Supreme Court of Appeal</a> (SCA) [official website] concerning the government's <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-court-rejects-governments-appeal-over-failure-to-arrest-bashir.php">failure to detain Sudan President Omar al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] despite an outstanding high court order barring him from leaving the country. However, DOJ spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga expressed his belief that the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] of South Africa is likely to arrive at a different conclusion than that reached by the SCA and that interpretation of legislation concerning head of state foreign immunity matters must be pronounced by the highest court. In its March 15 judgment, the SCA stated that the government's failure to arrest and detain Sudan President Omar al-Bashir for surrender to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] was inconsistent with South Africa's obligations under the Rome Statute as well as under section 10 of the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act 27 of 2002‚ and was therefore unlawful. Al-Bashir arrived in South Africa in June of last year to attend the African Union Summit in spite of an outstanding arrest warrant looming over his head to try him for alleged war crimes. On the question of head of state immunity under the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, Judge Malcolm Wallis in the SCA stated that the Implementation Act passed by South Africa removed any hurdles the government could have potentially faced in cooperating with the ICC. In other words, according to the SCA, there was no bar in this case for the government in arresting and detaining Al-Bashir and its failure to do so is a violation of the constitution. </p>

<p>In September the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/icc-asks-south-africa-to-explain-failure-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that South Africa provide an explanation for the country's failure to arrest Bashir when he was in the country last June. During Bashir's visit a judge for South Africa's high court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/south-africa-court-bars-sudan-president-from-leaving-country.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] barring him from leaving the country. Last March the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-seeking-un-help-in-bashir-genocide-prosecution.php">requested assistance</a> [JURIST report] from the Security Council in affecting the arrest of Bashir. In asking the Council to take "necessary measures" to force Sudan to comply with the ICC investigation, the court noted that without such assistance, the Council's decision to request investigation into Bashir in 2005 would "never achieve its ultimate goal." In February of last year African leaders <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop cases against Bashir and Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto or suspend the charges until African concerns are considered by the court. In December 2014 ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] told the Security Council that her office was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/icc-prosecutor-halts-darfur-investigation.php">dropping further investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the situation in Darfur.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US District Judge Christina Snyder <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/court-order-l-county-seal/">granted a permanent injunction</a> [order, PDF] on Wednesday requiring the removal of a depiction of a Latin cross from the Los Angeles, California (LA) county seal. The seal was changed in 2004 to remove all religious symbols and the cross was then reinstated in 2014. It was suggested in 2014 to add a small cross onto the seal to accurately reflect the cultural and historical role that the mission played in the development of the Los Angeles County region. The plaintiffs claimed that the representation promotes one religion, while the government represents all of the people, not just those who believe in that specific religion. The county argued that the cross is merely a depiction meant to reflect the county's history rather than serve as a religious statement. Snyder ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and found that including a cross on the seal demonstrated an unconstitutional preference for the Christian religion. </p>

<p>Religious displays on public property continue to raise controversial First Amendment questions. In November a judge for the <a href="http://www.arwd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas</a> [official website] ruled that a nativity scene on Baxter County Courthouse grounds <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-courthouse-nativity-scene.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In September the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a six-foot-tall statue of Jesus may remain on <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-religious-statue-to-remain-on-national-forest-land.php">US Forest Service land</a> [JURIST report]. In May the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-city-prohibition-on-park-nativity-scene.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Santa Monica, California city ordinance prohibiting unattended exhibits, including Nativity scenes, in Palisades Park. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/">UK Serious Fraud Office</a> (SFO) [official website] <a href="https://www.sfo.gov.uk/2016/04/08/tata-steel-investigation/">confirmed</a> [press release] Friday that it has opened a criminal investigation into <a href="http://www.tatasteel.com/">Tata Steel</a> [official website], looking into activity that took place at the Specialty Steels unit in the UK. Tata Steel is headquartered in India, but earns nearly 70% of its revenue from foreign business operations. While the company is not commenting on the on-going investigation, reports allege that the inquiry surrounds alleged <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/07/serious-fraud-office-launches-criminal-inquiry-into-tata-steel/">falsified documents</a> [Telegraph report] dealing with the composition of products sold to approximately 500 customers. </p>

<p>Fraud, corruption and other deceitful activity continues to be a worldwide concern. Earlier this month, confidential documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/leaked-panama-law-firm-documents-reveal-high-profile-individuals-hiding-assets-reports.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that world leaders and other high profile individuals are hiding billions in off-shore accounts. In March, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that she would sue Senator Delcidio Amaral for his allegations of corruption levied against her. Despite Rousseff's threats, <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">impeachment proceedings continue</a> against her, joined earlier this month by <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST reports] against Vice President Michel Temer. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myanmar authorities on Friday released 69 student activists who had been jailed for more than a year without trial. <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Myanmar.html#DistrictCourts">Tharrawaddy Township Judge Chit Myat</a> [NYU backgrounder] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/world/asia/myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-political-prisoners.html">announced</a> [NYT report] that the 69 students were free without charges after being imprisoned for protesting for academic freedom. All those imprisoned from the March 2015 protest that was <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/27/Myanmar-cracks-down-on-student-protests.html">violently crushed</a> [Al Jazeera report] by policewere released except the leaders. The release of the student activists came a day after the nation's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, <a href="http://www.dailynigerianews.com/2016/04/08/myanmar-court-frees-student-activists-after-suu-kyi-pledge/">announced</a> [Daily Nigeria News report] that freeing political prisoners and student activists was a major priority for the new government that has emerged from military rule. There are currently 121 <a href="http://aappb.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/121-political-prisoners-list-in-prison-last-Updated-on-7-Apr-2016-Eng1.pdf">political prisoners</a> [prisoners list, PDF] incarcerated and 414 <a href="http://aappb.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/414-PPs-List-Facing-TrailUpdated-on-7-Apr-2016.pdf">political activists awaiting trial</a> [prisoners list, PDF] in Myanmar. </p>

<p>The democratic reform processes has continued in Myanmar since ending a decades-old military rule.

In January the country <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/myanmar-begins-releasing-political-prisoners.php">began</a> [JURIST report] the process of releasing the first set of 102 mostly political prisoners days before a democratic power transfer took place. In October 2015 then-President Thein Sein <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/myanmar-government-signs-ceasefire-deal-to-end-conflict-with-rebels.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a nationwide ceasefire agreement with eight armed rebel groups in an effort to establish peace in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation was <a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/news/innocence-commission-bill-passes-alabama-senate-sylacauga-murder-case-cited/article_37694a6c-fd05-11e5-9f68-5bfa6f6b382d.html">approved</a> [<em>Anniston Star</em> report] by a 20-6 vote and would create a remedy for those inmates who have exhausted their appeals. The commission would <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/04/07/alabama-senate-approves-innocence-inquiry-commission/82765514/">review</a> [<em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> report] claims by death row inmates who claim "complete innocence" of any criminal responsibility for the capital crime and bring forth "credible, verifiable" evidence that has not been presented at trial or subsequent hearings. The evidence must prove the person's innocence and not simply raise doubts. The commission would then send the case to a three-judge panel to unanimously decide whether the person proved that he or she is innocent of the charges in order to then provide any relief. The bill's sponsor, Senator Dick Brewbaker, was <a href="http://www.correctionsone.com/capital-punishment/articles/170309187-Ala-legislature-votes-to-create-innocence-commission-for-death-row-inmates/">inspired</a> [AP report] by death row inmate Bill Kuenzel's story who has been unable to bring newly discovered evidence to prove his innocence in a 1987 murder in Sylacauga. </p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue around the world. Last month the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-stays-execution-in-texas.php">halted</a> [JURIST report] the execution of a Texas man who was convicted of killing his children while their mother listened on the phone. Also last month the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-supreme-court-allows-execution-of-death-row-inmate-following-botched-attempt.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] concern regarding Iran's alarming rate of juvenile executions and other flaws in the justice system. Mississippi lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/mississippi-lawmakers-propose-bill-allowing-execution-by-firing-squad.php">reintroduced</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would allow for execution by firing squad as an alternative to lethal injection. The Supreme Court of Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-supreme-court-allows-execution-of-death-row-inmate-following-botched-attempt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier last month, that the state could execute a man whose execution was halted in 2009 after a failed attempt to administer lethal injection drugs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.om-mp.be/page/2479/1/parketten_van_de_procureur_des_konings.html">Belgian federal prosecutor</a> [official website, in Dutch] announced Friday that five Islamic State (IS) members have been arrested in connection with the March 22 Belgium terror attacks that took 32 lives. Among those detained was <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1675214/who-are-mohamed-abrini-and-osama-kraiem">Mohamed Abrini</a> [SkyNews backgrounder], who is believed to be the only surviving perpetrator of the attack on the Brussels airport. At the press conference, prosecutors hesitated to confirm Abrini as the third attacker however, as one man, Faycal Cheffou, was already detained and later cleared as a suspect in that role. Among the other arrests made Friday was a <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1675214/who-are-mohamed-abrini-and-osama-kraiem">Osama Krayem</a> [SkyNews backgrounder], who prosecutors believe to have been involved in the Maelbeek subway station attack, the first public recognition that more than one perpetrator was involved. The other three arrested suspects are believed to have played more ancillary or support roles within the IS terror network. Abrini and three others were charged Saturday with terrorism offenses.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/the-islamic-state/">Islamic State</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which has claimed responsibility for the attacks, has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. IS also claimed responsibility for the November <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">attacks in Paris</a> [JURIST report]. Authorities have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/03/25/brussels-attacks-paris-attacks/82245514/">reported</a> [USA Today report] that that evidence gathered in three countries shows a "close working relationship" between terrorists who struck in Brussels and in Paris. Authorities have detained at least 11 people in operations in Belgium, France and Germany and have confirmed that one of the suicide bombers at Brussels Airport was the bomb maker related to the two suicide vests used in the Paris attacks. According to US counterterrorism officials, the ongoing police operations <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/25/europe/brussels-investigation/">suggest</a> [CNN report] that authorities are working towards preventing the next attack; investigators know of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/24/politics/isis-plots-europe-planned-brussels-cell/index.html">additional plots</a> [CNN report] in Europe in various stages of planning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Wisconsin trial judge <a href="https://courts.countyofdane.com/judges">William Foust</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.doj.state.wi.us/sites/default/files/news-media/Order%20Granting%20Plaintiff%27s%20Summary%20Judgment-216502.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] a Wisconsin law that would bar unions from reaching agreements to force private-sector workers to pay the equivalent of union dues. Signed into law last year, the <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/related/acts/1">"Right to Work" law</a> [Act 1 text] was deemed an unconstitutional seizure of union property, as the law still required unions to represent those not paying dues. The law briefly made Wisconsin the twenty-fifth state to adopt such legislation and was envisioned by <a href="https://www.scottwalker.com/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] as an integral part of his run for president. In ruling, Foust stated:<blockquote>Labor is a commodity that can be bought and sold. A doctor, a telephone company, a mechanic&#8212;all would be shocked to find they do not own the services they perform. ... Unions are no different; they have legally protectable property interest in the services they perform for their members and nonmembers.</blockquote>State <a href="http://bradschimel.com/">Attorney General Brad Schimel</a> [official website] vowed to appeal the decision. </p>

<p>Standards on employment issues are ever-changing in the US. Earlier this month, the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/california-top-court-rules-employees-entitled-to-a-chair.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that employees who can do their jobs while seated are entitled to a place to sit. The court held in a 7-0 ruling that "if the tasks being performed at a given location reasonably permit sitting, and provision of a seat would not interfere with performance of any other tasks that may require standing, a seat is called for." In February the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-tip-distribution-violates-labor-standards.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that employers may no longer collect tips from service employees and share them with support staffed even if the tipped employees are receiving minimum wage. Earlier that month Oregon legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/oregon-lawmakers-approve-highest-minimum-wage-in-country.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a law creating the highest minimum wage in the country. Also in February West Virginia became the twenty-sixth state to pass a right-to-work law, <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/west-virginia-legislature-passes-right-to-work-law.php">barring employers</a> [JURIST report] from requiring that their employees pay union fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Anti-Terrorism Court issued a nonbailable arrest warrant on Friday against former president and military leader Pervez Musharraf for detaining more than 60 judges after declaring a state of emergency in 2007. The proceedings were <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/1081126/atc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-musharraf-in-judges-detention-case/">held without Musharraf</a> [<em>Express Tribune</em> report], who left the country for Dubai after a court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/pakistan-supreme-court-permits-musharraf-travel-abroad.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] him from the exit control list last month to seek medical treatment. However, the judge told his lawyers that Musharraf should have obtained specific permission from the court before departing the country. He is ordered to appear in court in Pakistan on April 22. </p>

<p>The case against Musharraf has been ongoing since 2014. <a href="http://www.sindhhighcourt.gov.pk/">Pakistan's Sindh High Court</a> (SHC) [official website] in June 2014 lifted a travel ban that had prevented Musharraf from leaving the country. Musharraf was <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/pakistan-court-charges-musharraf-with-high-treason.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in March of that year on charges of high treason. If convicted, Musharraf could face the death penalty. Musharraf pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him, including unlawfully suspending the constitution, firing Pakistan's chief justice, and instituting emergency rule in 2007. Musharraf called the charges politically motivated and maintained that the country had prospered under his 2001-2008 rule and that his declaration of a state of emergency was not unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers for several public school teachers in California <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Friedrichs-rehearing-petition-5-8-16.pdf">requested</a> [petition, PDF] on Friday that the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] rehear the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/friedrichs-v-california-teachers-association/">Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association</a> [materials] after a ninth justice is appointed. Last month, an equally divided court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/split-supreme-court-affirms-ninth-circuit-decision-on-opt-out-policy-for-union-fees.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 2014 decision by the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in favor of union fees for non-union public employees. The petitioners believe the issues "are too important to leave unsettled with an affirmance by an equally divided Court, and they are guaranteed to recur in the absence of a definitive ruling." In their petition, they urge the justices to reconsider because the union fees are of importance nationwide, affecting thousands of public employees, and the circuits are split on the issue. </p>

<p>Petitioner Rebecca Friedrichs is a California public school teacher who opted out of her union, the <a href="https://www.cta.org/">California Teachers Association</a> [union website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-forced-union-dues.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in January, and Friedrichs argued that she should not have had to affirmatively opt-out of dues to that union, as that policy did not uphold her First Amendment rights. The case arose out of a California law that upholds an opt-out policy for a portion of the fees of nonmembers. Unions cannot compel nonmembers to support its political activities, and unions must send annual notices to nonmembers itemizing the union fees. Under California law, a nonmember must affirmatively opt out yearly to avoid giving the portion of the fees they cannot be compelled to pay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/15/15-60205-CV0.pdf">overturned</a> [PDF] a district court decision that allowed Google to ignore a subpoena. Mississippi <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] began investigating Google in 2012 for failing to do enough to prevent crime. He issued a 79-page subpoena, but Google refused to produce the requested information, instead filing a lawsuit. The appeals judges said their ruling did not determine whether the subpoena was reasonable, nor whether Google was immune from suit under the federal <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">Communications Decency Act</a>[text]. The judges said that Hood would have to take Google to state court to force it to comply and that Google could then challenge the subpoena.</p>

<p>Legal proceedings concerning the relationship between Internet service providers (ISPs) and alleged copyright infringers have taken place worldwide. In April the Federal Court of Australia <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/261094720/Dallas-Buyers-Club-LLC-v-IiNet-Limited-2015-FCA-317#scribd">ordered</a> [text] six ISPs to<a href="/paperchase/2015/04/australia-court-orders-isps-to-disclose-information-about-illegal-downloaders.php"> hand over</a> [JURIST report] information about alleged illegal downloaders of the US film Dallas Buyer's Club. In April 2014 the Senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/brazil-ratifies-bill-on-internet-privacy.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that puts limits on the metadata that can be collected from Internet users in the country. The law also requires ISPs to remove offensive materials following court orders and removes liability of ISPs for content published by their users. The Hague Court of Appeals in January 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/dutch-court-lifts-order-banning-pirate-bay-file-sharing-site.php#.U0gmUq1dVek">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2011 order of the District court that required two major Dutch ISPs to block customers from a list of addresses linked to The Pirate Bay. The court <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/29/pirate-bay-ban-lifted-in-netherlands-as-blocking-torrent-sites-ruled-ineffective">found</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that the ban had been nearly impossible to enforce and that the ones against whom the ban was being enforced, the ISPs, were not themselves violating any copyrights. In June 2014 the High Court in Dublin, Ireland, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ireland-court-orders-isps-to-block-pirate-bay-file-sharing-site.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] several ISPs to block access to The Pirate Bay and its proxy servers within 30 days; the plaintiffs included EMI, Sony, Warner Music and Universal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein on Friday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19797&LangID=E">warned about child torture</a> [press release] and urged a commitment to end it. At the 43rd session of the Board of Trustees of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/UNVFT/Pages/WhattheFunddoes.aspx">UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture</a> [text], Zeid stated, "neither national security nor the fight against terrorism, the threat of armed conflict, or any public emergency can justify torturing anyone ... and yet many States and non-State actors continue to torture people&#8212;a horror that my staff must combat daily." Customary international law, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text] all prohibit torture in all circumstances, especially the torture of children. The rights chief pointed out how they are easy targets in disputes in the international community. </p>

<p>The international community has been monitoring the rights of the child since the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text] entered into force in 1990. In July 2012 a UN committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-israel-treatment-of-child-detainees.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Israel's treatment of child detainees. In November 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-panel-asks-syria-for-report-on-child-torture-allegations.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] Syria to respond to inquiries regarding a report dealing with child torture. In November 2008 the US <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-admits-more-juveniles-held-at.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] to the committee that it was detaining 12 juveniles in Guantanamo. This realization came only months after the committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-tribunals-wrong-venue-for.php">asserted</a> [JURIST report] that military tribunals were not the proper venue for juvenile detainees. In May of that year the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dod-to-verify-number-of-juvenile-enemy.php">confirmed</a> a previous <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-detained-over-2000-minors.php">report</a> [JURIST reports] that the US was detaining 2,500 juveniles in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN human rights expert on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19800&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] the international community to put an end to financial secrecy in wake of the recent release of thousands of confidential financial documents known as the <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/">"Panama Papers"</a> [materials]. UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/IEDebt/Pages/CVJuanPabloBohoslavsky.aspx">Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky</a> [official profile] stated that secrecy revealed by documents such as the Panama Papers, which expose how various wealthy people and politicians systematically hide assets in offshore accounts, can have dire effects on society and the wolrd economy. He said:<blockquote>Tax evasion and the flow of funds of illicit origin undermine justice and deprive Governments of resources needed for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. ... The clients may have had different motives for depositing their assets into more than 210,000 secret shell companies. But tax evasion, hiding corruption and criminal funds appear to be a prominent reason.</blockquote>Bohoslavsky also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53639#.Vwqoj6QrKUk">noted</a> [UN News Centre report] that shell corporations have been used in the past for drug trafficking, illegal arms trades and even authoritarian rulers' violations of human rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers">Panama Papers</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder] are a collection of more than 11.5 million documents that were leaked last week from the fourth largest offshore law firm in the world, <a href="http://www.mossfon.com/">Mossack Fonesca</a> [firm website]. The documents reveal how wealthy individuals can utilize offshore tax regimes to their benefit. The clientele of the firm include many of the world's richest individuals, celebrities, and politicians. The documents <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/leaked-panama-law-firm-documents-reveal-high-profile-individuals-hiding-assets-reports.php">allegedly illustrate</a> [JURIST report] how Mossack Fonseca laundered money and helped their wealthy clients avoid tax consequences and dodge sanctions. It is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844">reported</a> [BBC report] that 12 heads of state are among those implicated by the Panama Papers, and Iceland's prime minister has already resigned his post as a result of the leak. Mossack Fonseca has denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were the victim of a data breach and that they have not engaged in any illegal activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former Serb general suspected of war crimes against Albanian civilians has been detained, police and a Kosovo-based human rights group reported Friday. Behxhet Shala of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms and police spokesperson Baki Kelani have <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/341c4bdf36924d6da303ae31ca6779ab/report-serb-ex-army-general-arrested-kosovo">confirmed</a> [AP report] that Milovan Bojovic was arrested on Thursday after attempting to illegally cross into Kosovo at the Merdare border point. The Council noted in a statement that Bojovic, who led Serbian army operations in the area of Llapi, is suspected of committing many crimes against civilians and killings. Shala told reporters that the crimes Bojovic is suspected of were against mainly unarmed Albanian civlians, and the killings ranged from individual ones to mass murders. During the 1999 war, in which Kosovo was fighting for its independence from Serbia, 499 Albanians were killed and 53 were still missing in that area.</p>

<p>In response to the widespread commission of war crimes during the conflict in Kosovo, EULEX was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">created in 2008</a> [JURIST report] to assist in the effort of bringing perpetrators to justice. In January EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/serb-politician-sentenced-to-9-years-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a Serb politician to nine years in prison for war crimes against ethnic Albanian civilians. In May 2015 EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/eu-judges-sentence-11-kosovo-albanians-for-war-crimes.php">issued verdicts</a> [JURIST report] in the Drenica I and Drenica II cases and sentenced 11 Kosovo Albanian men to prison. The charges included the intentional perpetration of violence, cruel treatment, beating, torture, humiliating and degrading treatment of civilians and for some the killing of a Serbian police officer. A EULEX prosecutor in the Kosovo Special Prosecution Office (SPRK) <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/sprk-indicts-15-for-war-crimes-at-kla-detention-center-in-1998.php">filed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] against 15 defendants in November 2014 in the EULEX Mitrovica Basic Court. The individuals were accused of war crimes against civilians that occurred at a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) detention center in Likovac in 1998. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has established a new constitutional court that will be inaugurated Monday with the swearing in of the last justice. The court, which will hold supremacy over all others, was quietly created by presidential decree, but those that oppose the creation point out that Abbas stacked the court in his favor by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-abbas-court-idUSKCN0X816B">appointing justices</a> [Reuters report] from his own political party. The <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/Fatah">Fatah Party</a> [Britannica backgrounder] supported the president's power to establish this court and stated that none of the party's officials possesses a hidden agenda. However, with the court being perceived as one-sided, as all members are either Fatah members or affiliated with Fata, it will inevitably contribute to the widening split between the Fatah and <a href="http://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamas">Hamas</a> [Britannica backgrounder], the opposing political party.</p>

<p>The Palestinian government has been criticized in the last year for the misuse of public funds after documents were <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/palestine-documents-leaked-claiming-political-corruption.php">leaked</a>, as well as for detaining West Bank students seemingly in an effort to <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-student-dissent-being-silenced-by-palestinian-authorities.php">silence political dissent</a> [JURIST reports]. However, internal controversy is not the only issue at hand for Palestine. Many issues are spurred by the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a> [HRW backgrounder]. At the end of March the spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Rupert Colville, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=18540&LangID=E">said</a> [statement] that his office was concerned about the apparent <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-office-concerned-about-extra-judicial-execution-in-west-bank.php">extra-judicial execution</a> [JURIST report] of a Palestinian man in the West Bank. In January <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-urges-businesses-to-cease-operations-in-israel-settlements.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] businesses to cease operations in Israel settlements. In August <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] urged both sides of the conflict to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-officials-denounce-west-bank-arson-attack-that-killed-palestinian-child.php">reconcile and move towards peace</a> [JURIST report] after an attack occurred in the West Bank village of Duma, where Jewish extremists allegedly set fire to a Palestinian home while the family slept. In April 2015 HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/04/13/ripe-abuse/palestinian-child-labor-israeli-agricultural-settlements-west-bank">alleged</a> [HRW report] that Israeli settlement farmers in the occupied West Bank are using Palestinian child laborers in dangerous conditions in violation of international laws. Last January Germany's top human rights official urged Israel to cooperate with the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] probe into possible war crimes in Palestinian territories. After a prosecutor for the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/icc-opens-probe-into-palestinian-territories.php">announced the investigation</a> [JURIST report], Israel's government said that it would not work with the ICC and called for its funding to be cut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: fully autonomous weapons must be internationally prohibited</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fully autonomous weapons, as opposed to the current remote-controlled drone weapons, must be <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/11/killer-robots-case-human-control">internationally prohibited</a> [press release], <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/11/killer-robots-and-concept-meaningful-human-control">report</a> [text] released Monday. The report is part of the <a href="http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/">Campaign to Stop Killer Robots</a> [advocacy website] and is intended for government leaders that are meeting in Geneva this week for the third annual meeting on lethal autonomous weapons systems. The attendees represent many of the countries that have joined the <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600585943/(httpPages)/4F0DEF093B4860B4C1257180004B1B30?OpenDocument">Convention on Conventional Weapons</a> (CCW) [UN backgrounder]. The report, "Killer Robots and the Concept of Meaningful Human Control," focuses on the inherent dangers of relinquishing lethal power to a robot that would select and engage targets on its own. The weapons do not exist yet, but the fear has led to the discussion of the need to keep human control present.<blockquote>In the arms arena, the term "meaningful human control" signifies control over the selection and engagement of targets, that is, the "critical functions" of a weapon. "This means when, where and how weapons are used; what or whom they are used against; and the effects of their use," according to Article 36, a UK nongovernmental organization. Humans should exercise control over individual attacks, not simply overall operations. Only by prohibiting the use of fully autonomous weapons can such control be guaranteed.</blockquote>HRW urges meaningful human control because humans make these decisions while taking into account broad principles, past experiences, empathy and other emotions, and the value of life, all things that a machine could not truly comprehend. According to the group, human control also promotes compliance with international law and provides for accountability, whereas a robot acting autonomously leaves a gap where nobody could be blamed for unlawful acts. The desire for human control is also supported by precedent such as the Mine Ban Treaty, prohibiting victim-activated landmines, and the prohibition on chemical and biological weapons. HRW is asking for an international prohibition on the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapons.</p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both the international arena and in domestic circles. In January the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ab6416c-829a-4a06-b378-3c0de0a48fb2/1/doc/13-3792comb_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6ab6416c-829a-4a06-b378-3c0de0a48fb2/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that the president's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/">National Security Council</a> (NSC) [official website] is <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-national-security-council-records-not-subject-to-foia.php">not subject</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [official website]. In November the Second Circuit ruled that the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/drone-memos-may-stay-secret-federal-appeals-court.php">may keep secret memoranda</a> [JURIST report] related to the legal justification for the use of drones for targeted killings of those in other countries believed to be involved in terrorism. The case was the result of FOIA requests by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> [official website] for documents prepared by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc">Office of Legal Counsel of the US Department of Justice</a> [official website] regarding the drone strikes. In June 2015 the families of two Yemeni men killed by US drone strikes <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/yemen-drone-strike-victims-families-file-suit-against-us.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the government, claiming they were wrongfully killed. In December 2010 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct <a href="/feature/2013/08/us-drones-abroad.php">targeted killings</a> [JURIST backgrounder], a challenge spurred because one subject of a targeted killing, al-Awlaki-Khan, was a dual US-Yemeni citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Six human rights organizations, including <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites], are calling for the next UN Secretary-General to do everything he or she can to protect innocent civilians whose nations face armed conflict. The groups have outlined <a href="http://www.civicus.org/images/Human%20Rights%20Priorities%20final.pdf">eight priorities</a> [text, PDF] that they believe the next UN Secretary-General must address to protect human rights in nations such as Syria, Iraq and South Sudan. The priorities outlined include strengthening the UN's impact on human rights, championing the rights of marginalized people, preventing and ending mass atrocities, combating impunity, defending civil society, ensuring gender equality, delivering a new deal for refugees and migrants, and ending the death penalty. The successor to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will be nominated before the end of the year.</p>

<p>In March EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Under the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-offers-deal-to-turkey-to-take-back-migrants/2016/03/18/809d80ba-ebab-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html">terms of the deal</a> [WP report], all migrants crossing the Aegean into Greece would be sent back to Turkey, effectively turning the country into the region's "migrant holding center." Meanwhile, Amnesty International last week a reported <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/amnesty-reports-record-number-of-executions-in-2015.php">record number of executions</a> [JURIST report] in 2015. On the gender equality front, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated in September that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-rights-chief-no-country-has-achieved-gender-equality.php">no country has achieved full equality</a> [JURIST report] between men and women </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Taiwan-born US Navy officer has been <a href="https://news.usni.org/2016/04/10/u-s-naval-flight-officer-lt-cmdr-edward-lin-accused-of-giving-u-s-secrets-to-china">charged</a> [charge sheet] with espionage, attempted espionage and prostitution, media outlets reported Sunday. Investigators believe Navy Lt. Cmdr. Edward C. Lin has been passing secrets to the Chinese government. Lin was an intelligence specialist on board the Navy's Lockheed Martin EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance when the alleged criminal conduct was committed. It is alleged that Lin successfully transmitted information to China about two or three times. Outside of transmitting secrets, the Navy also found evidence of actions of adultery connected to Lon's solicitation of prostitutes. </p>

<p>Lin's prosecution is the latest in a long line of prosecutions for the prevention of national security leaks. Last May former <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] officer Jeffrey Sterling was sentenced to 42 months in prison after being convicted of telling New York Times journalist <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/james_risen/index.html">James Risen</a> [NY Times profile] about classified plans to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions. In April of last year <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=David%20Petraeus&amp;IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">General David Petraeus</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/23/politics/david-petraeus-sentencing/">sentenced</a> [CNN report] to serve two years on probation and pay a $100,000 fine for leaking classified information to his biographer and lover Paula Broadwell. In August 2013 Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35 years in prison for disclosing</a>[JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">reports</a>] classified information to the anti-secrecy organization Wikileaks. In June 2013 Edward Snowden, a former government employee and contractor, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">charged</a>[JURIST report] with disclosing to newspaper reporters information about US intelligence activities that he obtained during the course of his work, raising significant <a href="/forum/2013/07/christina-wells-snowden-espionage.php">First Amendment concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the Espionage Act. In January of that year, John Kiriakou was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-cia-operative-sentenced-to-prison-for-disclosing-confidential-information.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two and a half years in prison for leaking an undercover officer's name to the media and for exposing parts of the CIA's torture strategies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of Sudan on Monday began its three-day referendum in the western region of Darfur despite <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/04/255663.htm">concerns</a> [press statement] from the US State Department that the political process would undermine peace efforts. The Darfur Referendum Commission <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/darfur-referendum-held-fears-voter-apathy-160411060337405.html">hopes</a> [Al Jazeera report] to resolve administrative debates by allowing voters to decide whether Darfur becomes one unified region or remains divided into five states. The commission plans to hold the referendum in 1,400 centers throughout the states' 62 localities and has promised to preserve the region's culture as stated in the <a href="http://unamid.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/ddpd_english.pdf">Doha Document for Peace in Darfur</a> [text, PDF]. The US, however, stated that such a voting process would not be fully inclusive since millions of Darfuris residing outside the region and in internally displaced persons camps would be prohibited from participating. The US further advised Sudan to resolve the Darfur conflict and end all hostilities by holding a genuine national dialogue that effectively includes all the Sudanese people. </p>

<p>The ongoing conflict in Darfur between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid has taken approximately 300,000 lives, and at least 138,000 people had been <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53626#.VwuwTBMrK34">newly displaced</a> [UN News Centre report] from the central region of Jebel Marra as of late March. In February a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-expert-conflict-in-sudan-must-end-immediately.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to the conflict and urged Sudan to respect international law and human rights and provide access to the <a href="http://unamid.unmissions.org/">UN-African Union Mission</a> (UNAMID) [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A labor arbitration panel in China on Monday opened a hearing in the country's first transgender job discrimination lawsuit, filed by a 28-year-old plaintiff known as Mr. C. C was born as a woman but has considered himself a man since college. C alleges he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/10/court-to-hear-chinas-first-transgender-labor-discrimination-case/">fired</a> [WP report] from a sales job at a health services firm just a few days into the position because the staff said he looked like a lesbian and threatened the company's reputation. The company alleges C was discharged for incompetence. The case is being heralded as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/12/world/asia/china-transgender-labor-discrimination.html?_r=0">China's first transgender job discrimination case</a> [NYT report]. Current laws in China do not allow for the job discrimination based on sexual identity. C is outspoken about the hope that his case will lead to a new anti-job discrimination law in China, or, at a minimum, raise awareness for the rights of transgender individuals to employment. A ruling is expected in C's case by the end of the month. </p>

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. In March, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/arkansas-ag-to-appeal-ruling-upholding-local-anti-discrimination-ordinance.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a judge' s decision upholding an ordinance that protects members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from discrimination. A day earlier, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">will not defend</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials], which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. Also that week, North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against Governor Pat McCrory claiming the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">bill signed the prior week</a> [JURIST reports] regarding transgender discrimination is unconstitutional and discriminatory. In February,  the Supreme Court of India <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/india-high-court-to-review-decision-banning-gay-sex.php">agreed to review its 2013 decision reinstating an 1861 law prohibiting sex between consenting adults of the same sex</a> [JURIST report]. The law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, was passed during the British colonial era and calls for a 10-year sentence for "carnal intercourse against the order of nature with man, woman or animal."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] operative Sabrina de Sousa filed an appeal in <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.pt/tc/home.html">Portugal's Constitutional Court</a> [official website] Monday in a last attempt to prevent her extradition to Italy to serve a six-year sentence for her involvement in a US extraordinary renditions program. De Sousa was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/portugal-court-orders-cia-agent-extradited-to-italy-in-rendition-case.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in a Portuguese airport after she had been convicted in absentia by an Italian court for her part in the 2003 kidnapping and rendition of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. The <a href="http://www.stj.pt/">Portugal Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-04-11/portuguese-court-rejects-ex-cia-agents-extradition-appeal">rejected</a> [AP report] her appeal of an extradition order, leaving De Sousa no choice but to argue that her extradition order is unconstitutional. A Constitutional Court official has stated that it is impossible to determine how long their decision will take. </p>

<p>Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. In September 2009 the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-dismissal-of-diplomatic.php">motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by De Sousa seeking diplomatic immunity against the Italian charges. De Sousa was one of many operatives whose sentences were <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">increased</a> [JURIST report] from five to seven years in 2010 by an Italian intermediate appellate court and upheld by the Italian Court of Cassation in 2012. In February the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/european-court-of-human-rights-condemns-italy-for-role-in-rendition-case.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Italy for its role in the rendition program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia <a href="http://governor.virginia.gov">Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] on Sunday offered amendments to an alternative <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+HB815+pdf">execution bill</a> (HB 815) [text, PDF] that would have required the use of the electric chair if lethal injections are unavailable. McAuliffe <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-guts-virginias-electric-chair-bill/2016/04/11/3c0d4a74-ff2f-11e5-9203-7b8670959b88_story.html">scrapped the bill's provision</a> [AP report] allowing for electrocution <a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/719523164208783360">stating</a> [official Twitter] that Virginians "do not wish to be forced into using this terrible form of punishment." McAuliffe instead added a provision permitting the state, when faced with a lethal injection drug shortage, to special-order drugs from pharmacies whose identities would be kept secret to shield them from potential political fallout. The state legislature can accept or veto this amendment on April 20.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. In February the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/about/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The US Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three UN human rights experts experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19804&LangID=E">urged Egypt</a> [press release] on Monday to cease its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations. They stated that Egypt is failing in its international responsibility to provide a safe and enabling environment for civil society in the country. The experts added that the Egyptian government must immediately put an end to all forms of persecution and take effective measures to protect members of human rights organizations, specifically members of <a href="http://nazra.org/en">Nazra for Feminist Studies</a>, the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> [advocacy websites] and the United Group - Attorneys at Law and Legal Advisors, who have been subject to interrogation and threatened with arrest warrants and prosecutions. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over its many human rights infringements and free speech violations. Of particular concern with Egypt's constitutional and human rights is the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists by the Egyptian government, which has garnered widespread criticism from governments and rights groups worldwide. Two weeks ago, Egypt Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was relieved of his position after he stated that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed in response a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists. In January non-governmental organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ngos-issue-statement-to-egyptian-parliament-on-enforcement-of-constitutional-and-human-rights.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] to the Egyptian parliament giving recommendations to ensure the enforcement of constitutional and human rights. In December Egyptian lawyer Nasser Amin<a href="/paperchase/2015/12/egypt-lawyer-challenges-censorship-law.php">challenged a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows writers to be jailed for writings that violate Egyptian "morals." In August 2015 Egyptian President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/egypt-passes-sweeping-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 54-article counter-terrorism law that has been met with significant controversy, as many believe it infringes on the freedom of the press. Many have said that the law defines terrorism too broadly and imposes harsh sentences and fines on violators. The same month <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/hrw-new-egypt-counterterrorism-law-threatens-press.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the law saying it infringes on freedom of the press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: EU trade agreement with Turkmenistan should be halted until human rights benchmarks are met</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/11/turkmenistan-eu-trade-pact-advances-minus-rights-progress">argued</a> [HRW report] that a proposed Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan should be halted until Turkmenistan meets human rights benchmarks. The European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/afet/home.html">held a hearing</a> [committee website; <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2f%2fEP%2f%2fTEXT%2bCOMPARL%2bAFET-OJ-20160411-1%2b01%2bDOC%2bXML%2bV0%2f%2fEN&language=EN">draft agenda</a>] on Monday to debate the conclusion of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Turkmenistan. The agreement is a framework agreement for trade and legal relations. Since 1999, the agreement between the EU and Turkmenistan has been halted because of the nation's failure to meet human rights benchmarks; including the unconditional release of all political prisoners, the removal of obstacles to free travel, free access to the independent red cross and other independent monitors, and improvements in civil liberties. According to HRW, Turkmenistan remains closed to human rights scrutiny and it has not honored requests from UN human rights experts to visit the country. HRW refereed to Turkmenistan as <a href="https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/turkmenistan">one of the world's most repressive countries</a> [HRW backgrounder], with a disastrous human rights record. </p>

<p>Under the rule of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16095366">Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov</a> [BBC backgrounder], Turkmenistan has transitioned from its authoritarian past as part of the Soviet Union towards a more democratic society. Yet, concerns over the nation's human rights record persist. In 2011 Turkmenistan <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/turkmenistan-adopts-new-law-regulating-presidential-elections.php">adopted a new law for regulating presidential electoral candidates</a> [JURIST report]. To qualify as a presidential candidate, an individual must be either backed by a political party or collect at least 50,000 signatures. The previous law required that a potential candidate receive approval from an advisory board established by former president Saparmurat Niyazov. The Democratic Party of Turkmenistan (DPT), which was previously called the Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR, is the country's ruling and only legal political party. In 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-sg-urges-turkmenistan-to-emphasize.php">urged Turkmenistan to place a stronger emphasis on human rights</a> [JURIST report]. At a joint press conference with Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, Ban said that he, "called on the government to fulfill all obligations under international human rights law and the many treaties to which it is a signatory." The country <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/turkmenistan-adopts-new-constitution.php">adopted a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, which envisioned a new multi-party political process and provided for limits on presidential power. Political reforms in Turkmenistan come after President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov, who remained in office for 21 years, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6199021.stm">died in 2006</a> [BBC obituary]. Turkmenistan gained its independence upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has been cited by the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights for widespread interference in judicial affairs, using torture, and suppressing political opposition, media, and civil society. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-4117.pdf">threw out a constitutional challenge</a> [opinion, PDF] to <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010100.htm">Utah's anti-bigamy laws</a> [text]. The lawsuit was brought in 2011 by the family from TLC's reality TV show <a href="http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/sister-wives/">Sister Wives</a> [media website] after their polygamous relationship was threatened by a county prosecutor under the state's bigamy law. The court determined that because the Utah County Attorney's Office had adopted a policy under which the family was under no threat of prosecution, the suit was therefore moot. The appeals court remanded the case to the district court and ordered them to dismiss the suit without prejudice. </p>

<p>In 2014 a judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] refused to dismiss the case as moot and proceeded to the merits, <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-partially-strikes-down-utah-polygamy-law.php">striking down</a> [JURIST report] portions of Utah's anti-bigamy statute. While polygamy is recognized in most of Africa and the Middle East, it is illegal in most of North and South America, Europe and China. In 2005 the US District Court for the District of Utah <a href="/thisday/2011/02/16/federal-judge-rejected-challenge-to-utah-polygamy-ban.php">rejected a similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against Utah's Anti-Bigamy Statute, reaffirming the 1879 US Supreme Court case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1104642225155375579">Reynolds v. United States</a> [text], which upheld a conviction under an anti-polygamy law as constitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/index.asp">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9603">said</a> [text] Monday that the only way to prevent future atrocities like the Rwandan genocide is to take shared responsibility and shared action to prevent them. Speaking at the General Assembly commemoration of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/commemoration/annualcommemoration.shtml">International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda</a> [official website], the secretary acknowledged the "bravery" of the survivors of the Rwandan genocide. Ban stated: <blockquote>The only way to prevent genocide and other egregious violations of human rights is to acknowledge shared responsibility and commit to shared action to protect those at risk. It is essential that Governments, the judiciary and civil society stand firm against hate speech and those who incite division and violence. We must instead unite to promote inclusion, dialogue and the rule of law to establish peaceful, just societies.</blockquote>The UN estimates show that in 1994 roughly 800,000 people were systematically murdered in Rwanda.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website], established in 1994, was the first international tribunal to deliver verdicts against those guilty of committing genocide. Within its 21 years, the ICTR sentenced 61 extremists to terms of up to life imprisonment for their roles in the Rwandan genocide. There were 14 acquittals, and 10 accused were transferred to national courts during this period. An International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals has been established, and eight fugitives remain at large. Only in January 2016, after issuing 45 judgments, did the ICTR <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52926#.Vv6m9za-rdm">formally close</a> [UN News Centre report]. In December <a href="http://www.interpol.int/en">Interpol</a> [official website] agents <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/interpol-arrests-suspect-wanted-for-1994-rwanda-genocide.php">announced the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of Rwandan genocide suspect Ladislas Ntaganzwa, who had a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35062919">US $5 million bounty</a> [BBC report]. In September a court in Toulouse, France, <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/france-court-blocks-extradition-of-genocide-suspect.php">refused extradition requests</a> [JURIST report] for Joseph Habyarimana, a Rwandan man, facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In January 2014 two Rwandan police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/rwanda-police-officers-jailed-for-killing-anti-corruption-activist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in jail for the murder of a Transparency International anti-corruption activist. Last July the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-court-for-rwanda-upholds-sentence-of-ex-military-chief.php">unanimously affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 30-year jail sentence for former army chief Augustin Bizimungu for the role he played in the genocide. In December 2012 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) has obtained secret documents from Syria that have led members to believe Syrian <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [official website] can be successfully prosecuted for war crimes. The documents allegedly <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/bashar-al-assads-war-crimes-exposed">prove</a> [<em>New Yorker</em> report] that Assad was the commander responsible for the torture and killing of his own citizens. This is the first international war crimes investigation completed by an independent group without a court order, yet funded by governments. The CIJA asserts that all that is needed to successfully prosecute Assad is a court to hear the case.</p>

<p>Last month the president of Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/turkish-president-calls-for-icc-prosecution-of-syria-president-assad.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution of Assad in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Also last month the <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">US House Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-house-committee-calls-for-syria-war-crimes-tribunal.php">passed two resolutions</a> [JURIST report] calling for an international tribunal in the Middle East to address the alleged war crimes committed by the government of Syria and its allies. The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the Assad regime, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier in March Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-syria-and-russia-forces-deliberately-targeting-hospitals.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Russian and Syrian armed forces are deliberately attacking hospitals and other medical facilities as part of a military strategy to clear the way to northern Aleppo. Just prior, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee passed two resolutions calling for an international tribunal in the Middle East to <a href="paperchase/2016/03/us-house-committee-calls-for-syria-war-crimes-tribunal.php">address</a> [JURIST report] the alleged war crimes committed by the government of Syria and its allies, specifically Russia and Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A committee in the lower house of the Brazilian <a href="http://www.congressonacional.leg.br/portal/">legislature</a> [official website, in Portuguese] voted 38-27 on Monday to recommend the impeachment of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [BBC profile] over corruption and budget violations before her 2014 re-election. The full lower house must pass the recommendation by a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36021230">two-thirds majority vote</a> [BBC report] to send the provision to the Senate. The voting committee was set up secretly in December and stacked with proponents of Rousseff's impeachment.</p>

<p>Last week the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer. In December the Supreme Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on two measures to set the stage for impeachment proceedings against Rousseff: one requiring the re-formation of a congressional committee set up to guide Rousseff's impeachment through Congress, and the other giving the Senate power to review a lower house vote for impeachment. Rousseff's opposition <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-rousseff-idUSKCN0SF1NU20151021">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval. Rousseff argued that the opposition is trying to impeach her to hinder government actions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN rights experts on Monday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19805&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] for Honduras to provide justice in the murder case of <a href="http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/berta-caceres/">Berta Cáceres</a> [backgrounder], as well as broad protection for everyone defending human rights and the environment. Cáceres was the founder of the <a href="https://copinh.org/">Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations Honduras</a> (COPINH) [advocacy website, in Spanish] and a prominent defender of indigenous rights and the environment, but she was murdered at the beginning of March for her positions despite a 2009 decision requiring Honduras to protect her. The UN experts hope for swift justice, but they fear for Cáceres' relatives and other human rights defenders. The experts stated:<blockquote>We encourage Honduras to act with due diligence in investigating Berta Cáceres' murder, and to effectively ensure the protection of her relatives and members of COPINH as requested by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.</blockquote>The UN experts also noted that women rights defenders are generally at more risk due to the patriarchal traditions in the society.</p>

<p>The experts are pleased with the arrest of a suspect for the murder of another COPINH leader, Nelson García, occurring less than two weeks after the murder of Cáceres. After the death of García, UN experts made a similar call for the protection of human rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-honduras-must-protect-human-rights-defenders.php">defenders</a> [JURIST report]. However, Honduras has been experiencing unrest throughout the country for some time now. Last November a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-urges-honduras-to-increase-efforts-to-curb-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Honduras to address internal displacement caused by organized gang violence and a failing criminal justice system. UN human rights expert Victoria Tauli-Corpuz <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-raises-concerns-about-indigenous-people-of-honduras.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the situation faced by the indigenous people of Honduras, specifically in connection with their land and natural resource rights, their lack of access to justice, education and health, and the general environment of violence and impunity affecting their communities. In October Honduran Congressional Vice President Lena Gutierrez <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/corruption-trial-begins-for-honduras-congressional-vp.php">began her trial</a> [JURIST report] for her role in the nation's recent medical sale scandal. The charges include falsification of public documents and fraud against the government by drug sales to the Ministry of Health. In June 2015 thousands of <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/protesters-call-for-resignation-of-honduras-president-on-corruption-allegations.php">protesters marched</a> [JURIST report] in Honduras on calling for the resignation of President Juan Hernandez and demanding an independent investigation into his role in an ongoing corruption scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yanghee Lee, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, on Tuesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19811&LangID=E">welcomed</a> [press release] the release of political prisoners in that country. The <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/MM/Pages/SRMyanmar.aspx">Special Rapporteur</a> [official profile] stated that "it was ... touching to see joyful scenes across the country as individuals [were freed] and able to reunite with their families." She maintained that the individuals should never have been imprisoned and that they could now take part in the country's "continuing transformation". Lee called for progress to continue, referring to recommendations made by the Legal Affairs and Special Cases Assessment Commission to amend more than 140 laws. The Special Rapporteur hailed the Thingyan Festival as the beginning of many things to celebrate in Myanmar and welcomed the commitment to release political prisoners and further democratic reforms by State Councilor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC Profile]. </p>

<p>The democratic reform process has continued in Myanmar since ending a decades-old military rule. The prisoners <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/myanmar-releases-political-prisoners.php">released</a> [JURIST report] last week were 69 student activists who had been jailed for more than a year without trial. Last month Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-myanmar-has-a-historic-opportunity-to-change-course-on-human-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Myanmar's new government has been presented with a historic opportunity to change course on human rights. Also last month Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military as part of a UN join action plan. In January the country <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/myanmar-begins-releasing-political-prisoners.php">began</a> [JURIST report] the process of releasing the first set of 102 mostly political prisoners days before a democratic power transfer took place. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Serbian rights group, the <a href="http://www.hlc-rdc.org/?lang=de">Humanitarian Law Center</a> (HLC) [advocacy website], announced Tuesday that it will be appealing a <a href="http://www.hlc-rdc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Presuda_Ljubisa_Dikovic-Natasa_Kandic_Fond_za_hum.pravo-anonimizovana.pdf">fine imposed</a> [judgment, PDF, in Serbian] by the First Basic Court in Belgrade to compensate the Serbian Army Chief of General Staff for damages caused by allegations of war crimes in Kosovo during the 1998-1999 conflict. <a href="http://www.hlc-rdc.org/?p=31693&lang=de">According to the HLC</a> [press release], Natasa Kandic, the former head of the HLC, was in charge when the initial publication <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/serbia-rights-group-alleges-war-crimes-by-new-military-chief.php">making the allegations</a> [JURIST report] was released in 2012. The <a href=/paperchase/2012/03/serbia-military-chief-files-libel-suit-against-rights-activist.php">claim was filed</a> [JURIST report] against her jointly with the HLC, and the court order a payment of USD $5,100 to be paid to the Army Chief. Kandic and the HLC claim the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/serbia-court-fines-rights-activist-war-crimes-allegations-38329411">judgment was political</a> [AP report], citing questionable conclusions by the court as well as potential illegal activity from the judge in order to protect the Army Chief.</p>

<p>In January Oliver Ivanovic, a Serbian politician in Kosovo, was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/serb-politician-sentenced-to-9-years-for-war-crimes.php">nine years in prison</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/eulex-kosovo-prosecutor-orders-detention-for-war-crimes-suspect.php">being arrested</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2014 for the murder and torture of Albanian civilians during the 1999 war where <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18328859">Kosovo</a> fought for its independence from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17907947">Serbia</a> [BBC backgrounders]. In response to the widespread commission of war crimes during the conflict in Kosovo, the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/">EU's justice mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">created in 2008</a> [JURIST report] to assist in the effort of bringing perpetrators to justice. A EULEX prosecutor in the Kosovo Special Prosecution Office <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/sprk-indicts-15-for-war-crimes-at-kla-detention-center-in-1998.php">filed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] against 15 defendants in November 2014 in the EULEX Mitrovica Basic Court. The individuals were accused of war crimes against civilians that occurred at a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) detention center in Likovac in 1998. Fatmir Limaj, an ally of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci was <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/kosovo-politician-again-acquitted-of-war-crimes-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] by EULEX in September 2014 for the third time after his <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/retrial-begins-against-kosovo-politician-accused-of-war-crimes.php">retrial began</a> [JURIST report] in April. Kosovo <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">officially seceded</a> [JURIST report] from Serbia in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's Supreme Court <a href="http://www.tsj.gob.ve/-/tsj-declara-inconstitucional-la-ley-de-amnistia-y-reconciliacion-nacional">declared</a> [press release, in Spanish] an amnesty law for jailed opposition leaders unconstitutional on Monday. The legislation, which was approved by the opposition-controlled congress, would have frees dozens of jailed opposition politicians and was among <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/venezuelas-high-court-rejects-amnesty-law-opponents-38320644">campaign promises</a> [AP report] that delivered control of congress to the opposition in 2015. The court reasoned that the law would allow for <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2016/04/12/570c2e7be2704e5f4e8b465f.html">impunity</a> [<em>El Mundo</em> report, in Spanish] because it would allow amnesty for crimes that were of a criminal and not political character. President Nicolás Maduro had strongly <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36021976">opposed</a> [BBC report] the law on the grounds that it was an attempt to destabilize his government and pardon those who he describes as "criminals." Since the opposition took control of congress, the Supreme Court has sided with Maduro's government. </p>

<p>The schism between the pro-government-controlled Supreme Court and the opposition-controlled National Assembly following the December election has steadily impacted the country. Venezuela's National Assembly had approved the amnesty law <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-legislature-passes-an-amnesty-for-dozen-of-jailed-dissidents.php">last month</a> [JURIST report], which would have freed 77 individuals for alleged political reasons under a number of crimes, such as instigation of violence or commission of treason. Earlier last month the Supreme Court ruled that the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review</a> [JURIST report] the appointment of 13 justices to the high court. In February the Supreme Court&#8212;contrary to Congress's rejection&#8212;<a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Maduro's "economic emergency decree" as legal and valid. In January the Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that decisions from the opposition dominated General Assembly would be void until three barred lawmakers were relieved form their seats. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/109/Bill/HB1840.pdf">bill</a> [HB 1840] [text, PDF] in Tennessee that will allow mental health counselors to turn away patients based on the counselors' religious beliefs passed on Monday. In February the <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/senate/">Senate</a> [official website] passed the bill that allowed counselors to turn away patients based on "sincerely held religious beliefs." The <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">Tennessee State House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/12/tennessee-bill-let-counselors-deny-services-heads-gov-haslam/82925740/">passed the bill</a> [AP report] 68-22 with the amendment that counselors could turn away patients based on the "sincerely held principles of the counselor or therapist." This amendment however will not allow therapists to turn away people who are in imminent danger or harming themselves or others. The Senate <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennessee-lgbt-idUSKCN0X91QX">agreed to this change</a> [REUTERS report] in a 26-6 vote on Monday and the bill will now head to the Governor's desk. Tennessee Governor <a href="https://www.tn.gov/governor/">Bill Haslam</a> [official website] has yet to state whether or not he would support the bill and sign it into law. Governor Haslam has 10 days to take action on the bill once it has reached his desk.</p>

<p>Many who oppose this bill claim that it is being used to allow Therapists to refuse counseling to the LGBT community. The intersection of religious liberty and sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. Last Week Mississippi governor Phil Bryant signed a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mississippi-governor-signs-religious-freedom-bill-into-law.php">allows</a> [JURIST report] state employees to refuse to issue same-sex-marriage licenses and private corporations and religious groups to deny services to the based upon religious beliefs. Also last Week Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/arkansas-ag-to-appeal-ruling-upholding-local-anti-discrimination-ordinance.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a judge' s decision upholding a Fayetteville ordinance that protects members of the LGBT community from discrimination. Last month Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a religious freedom bill that critics claim would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=14787">vetoed</a> [press release] a similar bill. Also last month North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper on <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] during a press conference that he will not defend House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. That legislation specifically prohibits local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination ordinances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15A999-Veasey-v.-Abbott-Response1.pdf">urged</a> [response, PDF] the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday to alllow it's voter ID laws to remain in effect while under review by a federal appeals court. The Court is <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/voters-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">considering a plea</a> [JURIST report] by a group in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15a999.htm">Veasey v. Abbott</a> [SCOTUS docket] to block enforcement of the law while the case is being heard in the federal appeals court. The <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/texas-defends-its-voter-photo-id-law/">concern</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] is the law will remain in effect during November's general election. The law, which has been in effect since 2011, has constantly come under scrutiny and challenge. The Supreme Court last ruled on the matter in October 2014 when they refused 6-3 from preventing the law's enforcement while lower courts studied it. It would take 5 of the current 8 justices to put the law on hold. The state in their reply, holds that over 95% of eligible voters already have a valid form of ID and that none of the individuals seeking help in this matter lacks proper Identification.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been a contentious issue in the US recently. Earlier this month an Ohio judge granted an <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-judge-allows-some-17-year-olds-may-vote-in-primaries.php">emergency order</a> [JURIST report] allowing 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election to vote in the recent Ohio primary. Also this month the Fifth Circuit agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. Last March Oregon Governor Kate Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">signed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. In November 2014 a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> [official website] and African human rights experts <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19806&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the Nigerian government to "escalate efforts" to locate and rescue people abducted by Boko Haram. The experts also implored the governments to keep those whose family members have been abducted informed as to the progress of the efforts that have been employed to find the missing and provide assistance to those families. The report concluded with the experts expressing that they will continue to support the efforts of the government to locate the missing.</p>

<p>The militant Islamic group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. In February UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Nigerian government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram. In November the UN Secretary-General<a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-sg-condemns-terrorist-attacks-in-nigeria.php"> condemned</a> [JURIST report] yet another attack by Boko Haram in Nigeria that left 30 dead and approximately 80 injured. In April 2015 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">reported </a>[JURIST report] that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been murdering women and girls previously taken captive by the group. The group has been increasing the intensity and frequency of its <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">attacks </a>[JURIST report] ever since it lost most of the territory it overtook earlier this year to the Nigerian army. Most of these attacks have centered around markets, bus stations, places of worship and hit-and-run attacks on villages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kentucky <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Attorney General Andy Beshear</a> [official profile] on Monday <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/pdf_news/20160411_complaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=AttorneyGeneral&prId=73">press release</a>] against Governor Matt Bevin over funding cuts to universities. Beshear is asking the court to block the governor's recent <a href="http://kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=KentuckyGovernor&prId=60">order</a> [press release], which immediately cut 4.5 percent of funding to public universities. Beshear argues that such an action was outside the scope of Bevin's authority and that budgets from the governor were to serve more "advisory" purposes.</p>

<p>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. The Supreme Court of Washington last August <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. Also last August the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-court-upholds-regulations-on-loans-at-for-profit-college-loans.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July in favor of tight regulations pointed at the for-profit college industry. The court ruled that the Education Department has the right to demand that schools show that their graduates are financially dependent enough to repay their student loans. In August 2014 a judge for a Travis County Civil Court in Texas <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/texas-judge-rules-education-budget-cuts-unconstitutional.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that the Texas legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty to provide for Texas public schools because the school finance system is structured, operated, and funded so that it cannot provide a constitutionally reasonable education for all Texas schoolchildren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Carolina <a href="https://governor.nc.gov/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website] on Tuesday issued an <a href="http://governor.nc.gov/document/executive-order-no-93-protect-privacy-and-equality">executive order</a> [text] that he says is meant to clarify the previously passed <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials]. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOmp6Lf1VTI&feature=youtu.be">statement</a> [video] on the order, the governor said that House Bill 2's mandate of gender-specific restrooms and locker rooms in government buildings and schools will be maintained, but that he will also seek legislation in a short session to reinstate the right to sue for discrimination in state court. The order came in response to significant backlash against the bill, which has been called discriminatory and unconstitutional by various individuals and rights groups. </p>

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month the North Carolina governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>States file brief urging appeals court to allow Maryland cross memorial</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twenty-five states, led by West Virginia, <a href="http://www.ago.wv.gov/pressroom/2016/Pages/Attorney-General-Morrisey,-25-States-Fight-to-Save-Veterans-Memorial.aspx">filed</a> [press release] a <a href="http://www.ago.wv.gov/pressroom/2016/Documents/2016-04-11%20WV%20Amicus%20Brief%20in%20Am.%20Humanist%20Ass'n%20v.%20Maryland%20-%20filed.pdf">friend of the court brief</a> [text, PDF] on Monday to argue that the War World I monument in the shape of a white cross does not violate the constitution. At issue is the fact that the Bladensburg World War I Veterans Memorial in Bladensburg, Maryland, is maintained by government funds, which the <a href="http://americanhumanist.org/">American Humanist Association</a> (AHA) [advocacy website] and others argue violates the <a href="/documents/constitutions/united_states.php#amendment_i">Establishment clause</a> [text] of the First Amendment. In the brief filed with the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the states argue that is not a violation of the constitution because there is a historical, not religious reason for war monuments to use religious symbols to honor fallen soldiers:<br />
<blockquote>The local American Legion post built the veterans memorial in 1925 on a median along a then-new veterans memorial highway stretching from Washington, According to the American Legion, this land was originally private, and the memorial was completed with private funds.The memorial was taken for public ownership and maintenance only later when "increased traffic on the roads surrounding the Monument" made it necessary. Several other veterans monuments have since been added nearby. Like the World War I crosses at Arlington National Cemetery, Bladensburg's veterans memorial uses religious imagery to "honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people."</blockquote>The states further argued that a ruling for the appellants would create a dangerous precedent that would imperil veterans monuments all over the country and is urging the court to uphold the district court's ruling. </p>

<p>Religious displays on public property pose a controversial First Amendment question. In December a judge for the US District Court for the District of Maryland ruled that the display the cross-shaped war memorial <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-judge-finds-public-cross-monument-constitutional.php">does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In November a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas ruled that a nativity scene on Baxter County Courthouse grounds <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-courthouse-nativity-scene.php">violates the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. That case was also brought by the AHA. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a six-foot-tall statue of Jesus <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-religious-statue-to-remain-on-national-forest-land.php">may remain on US Forest Service land</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://ffrf.org/">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> [advocacy website] filed the suit claiming that the statue, located atop Whitefish Mountain in Montana, violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. In May the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-city-prohibition-on-park-nativity-scene.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Santa Monica, California, city ordinance prohibiting unattended exhibits, including Nativity scenes, in Palisades Park. In 2014 a judge for the US District Court for the District of New Mexico ruled that a New Mexico city must remove a <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-rules-new-mexico-city-hall-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">Ten Commandments monument</a> [JURIST report] placed outside of Bloomfield city hall.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The President of Macedonia on Tuesday ended an investigation into allegations of government corruption and abuse of power, also pardoning all politicians involved in a 2015 wiretapping scandal. According to <a href="http://www.president.gov.mk/en/president/biography.html">President Gjorge Ivanov</a> [official website], the move came in an effort to defend national interests, but it has been called illegal by opposition leader Zoran Zaev. The sudden halt of the criminal inquiry goes against a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/world/europe/macedonia-gjorge-ivanov-wiretapping-corruption-investigation.html">previous agreement</a> [NYT report] by leaders of the country's four largest political parties to allow a special prosecutor to investigate the scandal and bring criminal charges if warranted. Ivanov stated that he was "convinced that this is a big step forward toward reconciliation," and that the country should no longer waste time on the matter. This announcement has been met with widespread opposition, sparking protests and prompting EU Enlargement Commissioner <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/hahn_en">Johannes Hahn</a> [official profile] to note that it may put Macedonia's hopes for EU membership <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36031417">in jeopardy</a> [BBC report]. </p>

<p>Tensions have escalated in Macedonia since its April 2014 elections, in which the Gruevski's VMRO-DPMNE party again won the election, leading to Gruevski's fourth consecutive term as prime minister amid allegations of fraud. In March 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-office-urges-impartial-investigation-of-macedonia-political-figures.php">expressed deep concern</a> [JURIST report] at the ongoing political predicament surrounding the release of incriminating audio recordings of conversations between officials in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Zaev was charged earlier that year for attempting to overthrow the government with the aid of an unnamed foreign intelligence agency. In September 2014 a Macedonian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/macedonia-court-finds-opposition-leader-guilty-of-slandering-pm.php">found Zaev guilty</a> [JURIST report] of slandering Gruevski for claiming that Gruevski took a bribe in 2004 to facilitate a Serbian businessman's purchase of a bank in Macedonia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.kontras.org/home/">KontraS</a> [advocacy websites] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1MYxNQMkVrvJw">urged</a> [video press conference] the US to release government files regarding the anti-communist massacres in Indonesia from 1965-1966, which killed half a million individuals. HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth and KontraS National Coordinator Haris Azhar held a press conference in Jakarta to make the request. Roth stated that a factual and accurate report needs to be made about the past atrocity because a process of truth telling has to happen in order for reconciliation to occur. He stated that remnants of the uprising created the blacklisting of communities and individuals who deserve an apology and compensation from the government. He argues that without the information there would be a general apology devoid of responsibility. Roth believes that there may have been an involvement between the US and killers in Indonesia. He believes the channels of communication will tell the history of 1965 which will constructively contribute to the future Indonesian process of reconciliation. Roth hopes that the release of the information will allow the people of Indonesia to heal and to prevent similar incidents from recurring in the future. </p>

<p>A "people's tribunal" <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/tribunal-opens-hearings-into-1965-mass-murder-of-indonesian-communists.php">opened</a> [JURIST report] in November at The Hague to investigate the murder of thousands of alleged communists by Indonesian authorities in 1965. Human rights lawyers have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/tribunal-opens-hearings-into-mass-killings-in-indonesia/2015/11/10/bc865780-878f-11e5-bd91-d385b244482f_story.html">charged Indonesia</a> [AP report] with nine counts, including torture, sexual violence, and murder, for the government's involvement in the deaths of roughly 500,000 people. The tribunal has no legal authority, but prominent human rights lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis, acting as prosecutor, said "the truth has to be told" about an issue that remains taboo in Indonesia. Non-legally binding verdicts are expected next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in Changsha, China, on Wednesday refused to allow a same-sex couple to register as married. The two men <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36032383">attempted to register their marriage</a> [BBC report] last June. After being denied, the couple filed the lawsuit in December. The judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/chinese-court-accepts-first-same-sex-marriage-case.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to hear China's first legal challenge over a refusal to issue same-sex marriage applications in January. A now 27-year-old man, Sun Wenlin, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/12084743/Chinas-first-same-sex-marriage-case-accepted-by-court.html">filed a case</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] against a civil affairs bureau for refusing to grant a marriage application to him and his same-sex partner. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1898421/gay-man-sues-right-marry-chinas-first-same-sex-marriage">same-sex marriage is not legal</a> [SCMP report], and same-sex couples have no legal protections. After the verdict, Sun announced the couple will <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474065742/chinese-court-rules-against-gay-couple-seeking-to-get-married">appeal the verdict and challenge the language of China's marriage law</a> [NPR report], despite pressure to abandon the case.</p>

<p>The issue of same sex marriage continues to be a controversial international issue. In February the Supreme Court of India agreed to review its 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/india-high-court-to-review-decision-banning-gay-sex.php">decision reinstating an 1861 law prohibiting sex between consenting adults of the same sex</a> [JURIST report]. In January the Supreme Court of Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mexico-top-court-strikes-down-jalisco-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">struck down language</a> [JURIST report] in a Jalisco state law defining marriage as being between a man and a woman. A same-sex couple in Northern Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/uk-couple-challenge-same-sex-marriage-ban-in-northern-ireland.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November to challenge the same-sex marriage ban, arguing that reducing their marriage to a civil partnership is unlawful discrimination. The same month, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled that same-sex couples can legally adopt children because <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">allowing</a> [JURIST report] same-sex couples to form a family upholds equality and is in the best interest of children and teens. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Religious groups including the <a href="http://www.littlesistersofthepoor.org">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> [advocacy website], and the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/dueling-responses-to-the-courts-aca-birth-control-idea/">filed supplemental briefs</a> [SCOTUSblog report; <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Becket-Supplemental-Brief.pdf">Petitioner brief</a>, PDF; <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/840511/download">DOJ brief</a>, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Tuesday in the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/zubik-v-burwell/">Zubik v. Burwell</a> [SCOUTSblog materials]. In a rare move, the parties were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-asks-for-supplemental-briefs-in-birth-control-case.php">ordered by the court to file supplemental briefs</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-argument-in-birth-control-mandate-challenge.php">oral argument in March</a> [JURIST reports]. The order tasked the parties to "address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners' insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees." The order is viewed as a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/parties-respond-to-supreme-court-request-for-contraception-coverage-compromise-1460514407">signal to the parties that the court is seeking to avoid a split 4-4 decision</a> [WSJ report] in the matter. The Little Sisters of the Poor presented the court with the option to make a carve out within the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text] for workers at religiously affiliated institutions. The federal government <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/12/obama-rejects-supreme-courts-contraception-trade-o/">argued</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] that religious non-profits should be required to alert their insurance companies and the insurance company would provide the contraception if desired, which would not change the self-certification process. </p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-grants-cert-in-birth-control-mandate-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <u>Burwell</u> and consolidated it with six other cases where religious non-profit institutions are challenging aspects of the birth control mandate under the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform laws in the US</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/11/court-to-hear-birth-control-challenges/#more-234211">dispute</a> [SCOTUSblog report] centers around the birth control mandate of the ACA. Petitioners argue that they fall under an accommodation set out in a 2013 rule making that clarified the ACA by providing an exemption for houses of worship and similar religious organizations from the birth control mandate, subsequent to certification from the US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] that the organization had <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/11/06/51684/">religious objections to providing contraception</a> [<em>Health Affairs</em> backgrounder], based on the privilege provided by the US government pursuant to the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/103/bills/hr1308/BILLS-103hr1308enr.pdf">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [bill text, PDF]. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds-acas-contraceptive-mandate.php">upheld the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act</a> [JURIST report] but enjoined the Secretary of HHS from the enforcing the mandate until the Court weighs in on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D04-11/C:15-2152:J:Ripple:aut:T:fnOp:N:1735047:S:0">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the district court must review Wisconsin's voter ID law to determine whether broad application constitutes an equal protection violation. The <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23">law</a> [materials] requires "certain [photographic] identification in order to vote at a polling place or obtain an absentee ballot." The <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] is challenging this statute on the grounds that undue burdens upon certain individuals in acquiring a valid ID should excuse them from this law. The court acknowledged the significance of this issue, stating that "[t]he right to vote is personal and is not defeated by the fact that 99% of other people can secure the necessary credentials easily." Wisconsin contends that the voter ID law is very similar to Indiana's voter ID law, which was upheld as constitutional by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The appeals court agreed, but distinguished the two laws due to Indiana's safety net for individuals unable to obtain a valid ID for financial or religious reasons, which was not present in Wisconsin. The court suggested the lower court examine the workings of the states' voting system before deciding upon the merits of the ACLU's contentions.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Earlier this month the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law. In January a North Carolina District Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-judge-rules-north-carolina-voter-id-law-can-take-effect-in-march-elections.php">declined to grant</a> [JURIST report] a motion enjoining the state from implementing its voter identification law in the most recent primary. In May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In March of last year Oregon Governor Kate Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">signed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. A federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form in November 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New Jersey administrative law judge, Jeff Masin, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2800337/Ted-Cruz-Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that presidential hopeful <a href="https://www.tedcruz.org/l/conservatives-are-uniting-2/">Ted Cruz</a> [campaign website] is a natural-born citizen of the US and is thus eligible to be placed on the New Jersey primary ticket. Masin ruled that Cruz is a natural-born citizen because his mother is a US citizen but noted that his decision could be further tailored after review by New Jersey's Lt. Governor, <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/admin/lt/">Kim Guadagno</a> [official website].</p>

<p>The issue of a presidential candidate's natural-born citizenship has been hotly discussed both in this race and last, with <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/tv-ads-promote-amendment-to-let.php">interest groups advocating</a> [JURIST report] for a constitutional amendment allowing for foreign-born presidents. Like the question at hand, in 2008, a judge of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-dismisses-obama.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the citizenship status and eligibility of then-Senator Barack Obama to become US president. The <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv04083/281573/1/0.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] filed by Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg, had alleged that Obama did not meet the constitutional requirement of being a natural-born US citizen, arguing that Obama had lost his citizenship as a child when his mother married an Indonesian man, and that there was insufficient evidence that Obama had been born in the US. Judge R. Barclay Surrick <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3807085678376493081">found</a> [decision, PDF] that Berg lacked standing to bring the suit because he did not face direct harm even if the allegations were true. The decision was <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2668306447838171173">upheld</a> [decision, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53672#.Vw5w4kuQnGs">expressed concern</a> [UN News Centre report] on Wednesday over reports coming out of the Republic of Congo regarding an apparent Government security operation in an area of southern Brazzaville known as the Pool. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19812&LangID=E">reports</a> [statement] flow from suspected police action taken against civilians, after the March 20 election against opposition leaders and their supporters. Seventeen people have died in these security operations, including three members of security forces, with several others wounded. The joint statement urges the government to ensure access to the Pool by humanitarian actors and that security forces act in full accordance with international human rights law.</p>

<p>In October voters in the Republic of the Congo approved an amendment to the <a href="http://www.presidence.cg/files/my_files/constit200102.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF, in French] to allow President Denis Sassou Nguesso to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-voters-approve-referendum-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">extend his term in office</a> [JURIST report]. The amendment allows presidents to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-government-announces-referendum-on-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">renew</a> [JURIST report] their term twice and removes the age limit for presidential candidates, currently set at 70. Nguesso, who is 72, would have been ineligible for the presidency without the amendment. Before being elected to office in 2002, he also served as president from 1979 to 1992. Nguesso was reelected on March 20.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Georgia officials executed Kenneth Fults Tuesday after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041216zr_3204.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF] the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2799934/15A1033-Fults-Stay-Application-15-8877.pdf">application for stay</a> [text, PDF] of execution. His attorney <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2799935/15-8877-in-Re-Kenneth-E-Fults-Petition.pdf">argued</a> [petition, PDF] that the jury which sentenced Fults, an African American man, was tainted by the racial bias of at least one member, after Fults pleaded guilty to murdering his neighbor, Cathy Bounds, in 1996. Fults completed a series of appeals and filed for both state and federal habeas corpus review over his nearly <a href="http://law.ga.gov/press-releases/2016-03-23/execution-date-set-kenneth-earl-fults-convicted-murder">20-year incarceration</a> [press release]. On April 8 his attorney filed an application for the stay of his execution with the US Supreme Court at least until the court decided <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/pena-rodriguez-v-colorado/">Pena-Rodriguez v. State of Colorado</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], a case before the court considering similar facts of racial slurs made by jurors. Fults was <a href="http://law.ga.gov/press-releases/2016-04-12/kenneth-earl-fults-executed-evening-1996-murder-cathy-bounds">executed</a> [press release] Tuesday night. </p>

<p>Earlier this month the Supreme Court on <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040416zor_5i36.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in a case regarding racial bias expressed in jury deliberation and whether the no-impeachment rules applied in this scenario violate an individual's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] right to an impartial jury. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-606.htm">Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado</a> [docket] has come before the Supreme Court because after the initial verdict against Miguel Angel Pena-Rodriguez, two jurors came forward and alleged that another juror had made racially-charged comments during deliberation, that suggested the verdict could have been based on <a href="h/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-racial-bias-in-jury-deliberation.php">racial bias</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mossack Fonseca has <a href="http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf">denied</a> [press release, PDF] any wrongdoing and <a href="http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/COMUNICADO-ACLARATORIO-Panama-ENG.pdf">claimed</a> [press release] that it is "willing and eager to cooperate with authorities." On the topic, the firm has made public statements about its computers being <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/059dfb6b17af4c37b4496f09e89d5fd8/investigators-visit-panama-papers-law-firms-office">compromised</a> [AP report]. </p>

<p>World leaders and other high profile individuals are hiding billions in off-shore accounts, according to reports that cite confidential <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/leaked-panama-law-firm-documents-reveal-high-profile-individuals-hiding-assets-reports.php">documents leaked</a> [JURIST report] from Mossack Fonseca. The documents, coined the "<a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/">Panama Papers</a>" [website] by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, purportedly show that numerous politicians, celebrities and other wealthy individuals have hid money utilizing the legal services of Mossack Fonseca. The Panama Papers include 11 million documents allegedly illustrating how the firm laundered money and helped their wealthy clients avoid tax consequences and dodge sanctions. It is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844">reported</a> [BBC report] that 12 heads of state are among those implicated by the Panama Papers. Mossack Fonseca has denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were the victim of a data breach and that they have not engaged in any illegal activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Louisiana <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/">Governor John Bel Edwards</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/news/gov-edwards-signs-nondiscrimination-executive-order">signed </a>[press release] an <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/assets/ExecutiveOrders/JBE16-11.PDF">executive order</a> [text, PDF] that creates a new anti-discrimination law intended to protect members of the LGBT community. Prior to signing the executive order, there was no state law in Louisiana protecting LGBT individuals from employment discrimination. In signing the bill, Governor Edwards stated, "We are fortunate enough to live in a state that is rich with diversity, and we are built on a foundation of unity and fairness for all of our citizens." The order has broken new ground in the state, as it marks the first time Louisiana has specifically recognized the equal rights of transgender people. Governor Edwards's order rescinds previous laws established by his successor Bobby Jindal, who worked to limit certain LGBT rights. </p>

<p>The intersection of religious liberty and sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. Earlier this week Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20152016/HB/757">religious freedom bill </a>[HB 757, text] that critics claim would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Wednesday <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=14787">vetoed</a> [press release] a similar bill. North Carolina Attorney General <a href="http://www.ncdoj.gov/About-DOJ/The-Attorney-General/Attorney-General-Roy-Cooper.aspx">Roy Cooper</a> [official profile] on Tuesday stated [JURIST report] during a press conference that he will not defend <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials], which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. That legislation specifically prohibits local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination ordinances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Chicago task force assigned by Mayor <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor.html">Rahm Emanuel</a> [official website] on Wednesday issued a <a href="https://chicagopatf.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PATF_Final_Report_Executive_Summary_4_13_16.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] finding that racism has caused systematic failures within the city's police department. The report includes statistics illustrating how African Americans are the group most often targeted and mistreated by police officers within the city of Chicago. According to the task force, 74 percent of the 408 people who were shot by Chicago PD between 2008 and 2015 were African American. The report also discussed police stops and use of excessive force. In response to these findings, the task force has called for both the dissolving of the Independent Police Review Authority and the expansion of officer body camera use. </p>

<p>Claims of police abuse continue to generate controversy throughout the US. In October, three former detainees <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/chicago-police-sued-for-detainee-abuse.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the City of Chicago [official website] and a number of Chicago police officers for alleged abuse at an "off the books" detention center.  In September a Ferguson, Missouri reform panel released a report calling for the <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ferguson-commission-recommends-police-reform.php">consolidation of police departments</a> [JURIST report] and municipal courts. Also that month Baltimore City Circuit Judge Barry Williams <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-judge-denies-motion-to-drop-charges-against-police-in-freddie-gray-trial.php">rejected motions</a> [JURIST report] to drop charges against six police officers implicated in the case of Freddie Gray, a black man who was injured in police custody and later died. In August the Chicago Police Department<a href="/paperchase/2015/08/chicago-allows-independent-stop-and-frisk-evaluation-under-agreement.php"> decided</a> [JURIST report] to allow independent evaluations of their stop-and-frisk procedures that many have said specifically target African Americans under an agreement with the American Civil Liberties Union. In August of last year New York City <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/nyc-drops-appeal-in-nypd-stop-and-frisk-lawsuit.php">formally dropped</a> [JURIST report] the city's appeal of rulings in lawsuits involving the New York Police Department's (NYPD) use of stop-and-frisk tactics. Mayor Bill De Blasio's administration agreed to end the lawsuit against the NYPD after reaching a settlement requiring three years of NYPD oversight by a court-appointed monitor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0089p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [ruling, PDF] that obtaining phone location records without a warrant was not a violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The FBI obtained cellphone locations of two suspects in several robberies, later convicted on several charges, through cell-site data via the two suspects' wireless carriers. The location data showed the suspects to be within a half-mile to two miles of the location of robberies around the time that the robberies took place. While it acknowledged the importance of protected privacy interests related to personal communications, the court determined that "although the content of personal communications is private, the information necessary to get those communications from point A to B is not." The court refused to extend Fourth Amendment protection to metadata, like the location of individual's communicating or IP addresses, as collection of these business records do not reveal the content of those communications and so the suspects had no expectation of privacy in the information obtained. Against the argument of the defense, the court distinguished this activity from obtaining information from smartphones, which "typically store vast amounts of information about their users," as here the FBI only obtained an individual's location within a "two-mile wedge."</p>

<p>Technology continues to raise important privacy questions. Last November the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-declines-case-on-cell-data-search-warrant.php">rejected a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data. In October California <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19156">signed</a> [press release] into law the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB178">California Electronic Communications Act</a> (CECA) [text], a law that many are touting as a substantial step forward for digital privacy and protecting users' rights. The law, which was approved alongside more than 10 other bills, bars any state's law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from requesting sensitive metadata from persons or businesses <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-governor-signs-sweeping-digital-privacy-bill-into-law.php">without a warrant</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies is not sufficiently protected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry released the annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015</a> [text] on Wednesday, pointing to "a global governance crisis" in is prefatory statement. The secretary cited the "accelerating trend by both state and non-state actors ... to marginalize opposition voices, and in the most extreme cases, to kill people or drive them from their homes." The secretary listed various grim examples of human rights abuses committed in 2015, including "criminal acts by non-state actors such as Da'esh, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, the Taliban, transnational criminal organizations, " genocide and crimes against humanity directed against religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, jailing of reporters for writing critical stories about the government, and the closure of non-governmental organizations for promoting universal human rights. The secretary also highlighted from the report "the troubling trend among some elected leaders who undermined existing democratic institutions, such as by taking steps to stifle opposition, circumvent the electoral process, and weaken judiciaries, often in an attempt to perpetuate their continued rule." Finally, the secretary also pointed to corruption concerns. According to Kerry, "Institutions lose credibility when people can no longer expect a fair and impartial judiciary to address their grievances, obtain basic government services without a bribe, or participate in the political process without their franchise being undermined by corruption.  People must have faith in their institutions in order for societies to thrive." Despite the largely grim outlook outlined by the report the Secretary stressed that this must "strengthen our resolve to promote fundamental freedoms, to support human rights defenders, and to document and promote accountability for violations of human rights ... because it is right and because it reinforces our interest in a more peaceful world."</p>

<p>In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-worldwide-human-rights-in-danger-of-unraveling.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2016/02/annual-report-201516/">Annual Report 2015/16</a> [text], a summary of an international survey of human rights concluding that "short-term national self-interest and draconian security crackdowns have led to a wholesale assault on basic freedoms and rights." AI attributed much of this failure to a lack of accountability in the international system, as the UN and other intergovernmental bodies are largely unable to enforce human rights without the consent of the nations involved. In January Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-releases-report-on-human-rights-issues-worldwide.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] discussing human rights issues in more than 90 countries throughout 2015. World Report 2016, the rights group's twenty-sixth edition of the report, which spanned 659 pages, included short summaries of important rights topics before breaking down rights concerns by country. One major theme of this report was the treatment of refugees worldwide, especially those driven out of Syria by the Islamic State, calling Europe's approach to refugees counter productive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 49-year old Liberian national and resident of East Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, Mohammed Jabbateh, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/file/840546/download">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF; <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edpa/pr/immigration-charges-unsealed-against-liberian-national">press release</a>] in Philadelphia on Wednesday on two counts of immigration fraud and two counts of perjury for failing to disclose his crimes in Liberia when he applied for political asylum in December 1998 and when he was interviewed by an immigration asylum officer in January 1999. According to US officials, Jabbateh, who was popularly known as "Jungle Jabbah," was believed to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-liberia-idUSKCN0XA2KJ">involved in civil war atrocities</a> [Reuters report] including committing or ordering troops to commit murder and torture, public rape, enslavement of civilian noncombatants, and conscription of child soldiers. US Attorney Zane David Memeger stated that Jabbateh had concealed his identity as an officer of the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia and "allegedly committed unspeakable crimes in his home country, brutalizing numerous innocent victims." How federal authorities learned of Jabbateh's true identity remains a mystery as prosecutors declined to comment. Special Agent-in-Charge Jack Staton of Homeland Security Investigations stated that the "United States ... will not be a safe haven for alleged human rights violators and war criminals." According to Memeger, Jabbateh faces a 30-year prison sentence if convicted, although he is unlikely to be deported. </p>

<p>Liberia continues to be in the headlines for alleged and proven war crimes spanning a number of decades. As recently as September 2013, the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/charles-taylors-50-year-sentence-upheld-on-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> by former Liberian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2963086.stm">Charles Taylor</a> [BBC profile; <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=charles%20taylor&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">JURIST news archive</a>] of his convictions for war crimes [JURIST report] committed during the decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone. In February 2010 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/liberia-reconciliation-efforts-must.php">emphasized</a> [JURIST report] that reconciliation in Liberia hinges on the development of its national security and its legal institutions. A UN report issued in April 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/liberia-facing-poor-human-rights.php">examined</a> [JURIST report] Liberia's struggles with corruption in its criminal justice system, poor detention conditions, and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and forced marriage. In November 2006 the UN Independent Expert on the promotion and protection of human rights in Liberia <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/un-expert-urges-acceleration-of.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Liberian government to press ahead with its Truth and Reconciliation Commission and appoint members to its Independent National Commission on Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An education reform group, <a href="https://www.studentsforedreform.org/mn/">Students for Education Reform Minnesota</a> [official website], initiated a <a href="http://edjustice.org/app/uploads/2016/04/2016-04-13-Complaint_FINAL.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the state Wednesday claiming state laws governing teacher tenure violates students' fundamental rights to an education. Minnesota law allows a teacher to obtain tenure after three years. Plaintiffs <a href="http://www.startribune.com/suit-says-minnesota-protects-bad-teachers-at-expense-of-students/375609941/">claim</a> [<em>Star Tribune</em> report] that education is suffering because three years is too short a time period to determine whether an educator should obtain lifetime job protection. Plaintiffs also claim the laws on firing teachers are too vague. The process to let teachers go is long and very time consuming, resulting in ineffective teachers remaining in the classroom for an extended time. The <em>Star Tribune</em> reported that evaluations prove the most ineffective teachers were concentrated in schools with the highest poverty levels. </p>

<p>In recent years legislation surrounding education and teachers has generated controversy in the US. In August 2014, education advocacy groups in New York challenged the state's teacher <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/new-york-advocacy-groups-challenge-teacher-tenure.php">tenure laws</a> [JURIST report], claiming that laws protecting teacher employment violate the civil rights of children to a quality education. In June a judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that the California's system for tenure and seniority for public school teachers is <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/alifornia-court-strikes-down-teacher-tenure-system.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the state's legislature violated the Kansas constitution when it underfunded K-12 public <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kansas-high-court-finds-public-school-funding-reductions-unconstitutional.php">education</a> [JURIST report] during the 2009 through 2012 school years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/the-commissioner">Nils Muižnieks</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/turkey-security-trumping-human-rights-free-expression-under-threat">called</a> [press release] on Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. The remarks were made at the end of a nine-day official visit to the country to observe the ways in which the Turkish government was balancing human rights concerns among growing security threats. The Commissioner's concerns are due to his observations and his discussions with the local community. To combat terrorism, Turkey has increased their interactions with media by having trustees take over publications, which has led to censorship fears. In addition, the investigations have reportedly curtailed basic judicial rights in order to complete investigations in a timely fashion. The Commissioner argues that the measures will not only impact human rights in the long term but also prevent the growth of democracy in the country.</p>

<p>Turkey and its treatment of human rights are cause for concern due to the growing partnership with the EU caused by the refugee crisis. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed</a>  [JURIST report] to a deal with Turkey in March to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/turkey-eu-violating-international-law-by-breaking-migrant-pact.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] last week that EU states are violating international law by breaking their migrant pact with Turkey by not allowing the country to extradite suspected terrorists. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/amnesty-turkey-forcibly-returning-syria-refugees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey has been forcibly returning up to 100 refugees to Syria per day and expressed concern for the possible future of transported migrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French court on Wednesday ruled to extradite Radomir Susnjar, who is suspected to have committed war crimes during Balkan conflict of the 1990s, to Sarajevo where he will face charges concerning his involvement. Susnjar, who was <a href="http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/?id=2394&jezik=h">arrested in France</a> [press release, in Croatian] in 2014, allegedly locked innocent civilians in a house and set it on fire. The French court, however, could only<a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20160413-french-court-approves-extradition-bosnian-war-crimes-suspect"> extradite</a> [RFI report] Susnjar under common law and international principles because the actions of Susjnar were not punishable under French law at the time of their commission and France has a non-retroactivity principle. However, the actions were punishable under International and European law, which prosecutors argued meant that the non-retroactivity law did not apply to crimes against humanity, a rationale the court accepted. Susnjar's lawyer, Oliver Morice, believes that the court gave into pressure and indicated that he is willing to take the case to France's top court.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the conflict. Last month the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/icty-acquits-serbian-nationalist-seselj-of-all-balkan-war-crimes.php#">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Vojislav Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party and former Assembly member of Serbia, of all crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Balkan war. In May 2015 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icty-orders-serbia-to-return-seselj-to-detention.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Serbia's justice ministry to <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">return Šešelj to his detention cell immediately after he was released in February</a> [JURIST op-ed] to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. The ICTY had revoked his <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March because Šešelj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to The Hague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon announced Wednesday that his license to practice law was revoked by the judicial bureau. The bureau allegedly <a href="https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/04/14/chinese-human-rights-lawyer-pu-zhiqiang-loses-licence-due-to-social-media-posts-criticising-govt/">disbarred</a> [FP report] Pu from practicing law because of a December <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/prominent-china-rights-lawyer-released.php">criminal conviction</a> [JURIST report] associated with using social media to critique the government. The move is criticized as a way to curtail activists from using their positions to critique the government. Such instances are an issue of concern that was detailed in a US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/252967.pdf">study</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/us-state-department-releases-grim-version-of-annual-report-on-world-human-rights-practices.php">report</a>]  which stated that, "[i]ndividuals and groups regarded as politically sensitive by authorities faced tight restrictions on their freedom to assemble, practice religion, and travel. Authorities resorted to extralegal measures, such as enforced disappearance and strict house arrest, including house arrest of family members, to prevent public expression of critical opinions." The Chinese government <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/">responded</a> [Xinhua report] with their own report condemning the human rights violations committed in the US. </p>

<p>Chinese lawyer and professor, Chen Taihe, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">fled China</a> [JURIST report] in March and arrived in San Leandro, California, after he was detained last July as part of a crackdown on rights lawyers. The crackdown culminated in at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in February over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile], on Thursday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19816&LangID=E">urged Iran to stop executions</a> [press release] over drug offenses pending the debate of a law that would remove the mandatory death penalty as punishment for those convicted of drug offenses. Citing the fact that the highest number of executions, 966, in "more than two decades" were carried out last year with a majority being related to convictions on drug charges, Zeid said that the law was an "encouraging sign" from Iran. He concluded his remarks urging a moratorium on the death penalty until the law had been debated.</p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its use of the death penalty. Last month UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, expressed continued concern regarding Iran's alarming rate of <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-rate-of-juvenile-executions-in-iran.php">juvenile executions</a> [JURIST report] and other flaws in the justice system. In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] criticized Iran's justice system after 40 men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-criticizes-iraq-over-death-sentences.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report]. In January AI reported on the many juvenile <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ai-releases-report-on-death-row-juvelniles-in-iran.php">offenders</a> [JURIST report] on death row in Iran. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/0b29fa07-ab15-44ca-9f75-1ad52381eb74/3/doc/16-628_so.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/0b29fa07-ab15-44ca-9f75-1ad52381eb74/3/hilite/">denied</a> [order, PDF] creditors seeking to keep in place court-ordered protections following Argentina's 2001 default of $100 billion in bonds. Investors who had paid full price for their bonds <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-04-13/court-sides-with-argentina-speeding-along-bond-settlements">urged</a> [AP report] the court to leave the order in place, as they were reluctant to receive a reduced percentage payout. Judge <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/judges/bios/cfd.html">Christopher Droney</a> [official profile] said the court should determine whether Argentina has met the required conditions before lifting the court order permanently. Since January, Argentina has reached agreements to pay more than eight billion dollars to its creditors. The judge expressed his desire to clear the protective orders in order to allow Argentina to strengthen its ability to maneuver in worldwide markets. </p>

<p>Litigation related to Argentina's 2001 debt default has continued for years. Last September the Second Circuit ruled that a lower court judge should not have expanded a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-expand-argentina-bond-class-action.php">class action suit</a> [JURIST report] of bondholders suing Argentina. District Judge Thomas Griesa had been overseeing litigation related to Argentina's sovereign debt default for roughly 14 years. The appeals court noted it was the fourth time it had reviewed and subsequently rejected Griesa's method for calculating damages. Last April the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-argentinas-contempt-appeal-in-ongoing-debt-dispute.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the Argentine government's appeal of a contempt charge in an ongoing dispute over Argentina's bond default. In September 2014 Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/argentina-passes-law-circumventing-us-court-ruling-limiting-debt-repayments.php">signed into law</a> a bill to continue making payments on foreign-held bonds outside of US jurisdiction, circumventing the US court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-orders-argentina-to-pay-more-than-1-billion-to-investors.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that prohibits Argentina from paying its bondholders until the dispute is resolved. In August 2014 Argentina initiated legal <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/argentina-sues-us-in-international-tribunal-over-debt.php">proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against the US in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] over US interference in the restructuring of Argentina's foreign debt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ACLU attempts to block Kansas voter ID law</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Thursday asked a federal judge to issue an injunction pending the outcome of a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/fish-v-kobach-complaint">lawsuit filed in February</a> [complaint; <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-lawsuit-behalf-thousands-kansans-blocked-voting-over-illegal-documentation">press release</a>]. The ACLU is <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/fish-v-kobach">attempting to block</a> [ACLU case statement] a Kansas state law that requires individuals to prove American citizenship when they are registering to vote while applying for a driver's license. The Kansas law took effect January 1, 2013 and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/kansas-voterid-idUSL2N17H0GX">was passed</a> [<em>Reuters</em> report] in an attempt to deter voter fraud. The ACLU claims that Kansas is violating the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-national-voter-registration-act">Motor-Votor Law of 1993</a> [DOJ backgrounder] by demanding additional proof of citizenship. The ACLU is concerned that as many as 20,000 people, namely young people and minorities, are prevented from registering to vote because they do not have the means to comply with this law. The lawsuit, which names Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobash as a defendant, is set for trial in 2017.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been a contentious issue in the US recently. Last month an Ohio judge granted an <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-judge-allows-some-17-year-olds-may-vote-in-primaries.php">emergency order</a> [JURIST report] allowing 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election to vote in the recent Ohio primary. Also last month the Fifth Circuit agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. Last March Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. In November 2014 a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> [corporate website] <a href="https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2016/04/ECPA-Complaint.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF] the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Thursday regarding the privacy of their customers' emails. Microsoft filed the lawsuit in the US <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] in an attempt to block authorities from taking customer emails without Microsoft's knowledge. Microsoft <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-privacy-precedents-idUSKCN0XC05Z?mod=related&channelName=cybersecurity">claims</a> [<em>Reuters</em> report] that the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/jmd/electronic-communications-privacy-act-1986-pl-99-508">1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> [DOJ material] is unconstitutional as it goes against their <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> and their customers' <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [texts] rights. Microsoft alleges that the federal government is violating these rights by preventing Microsoft from notifying its customers about government requests for their emails. </p>

<p>Technology continues to raise important privacy questions. In April the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-no-warrant-required-to-obtain-phone-location-records.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that obtaining phone location records without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Last November the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-declines-case-on-cell-data-search-warrant.php">rejected a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data. In October California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-governor-signs-sweeping-digital-privacy-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the California Electronic Communications Act (CECA), a law that many are touting as a substantial step forward for digital privacy and protecting users' rights. The law, which was approved alongside more than 10 other bills, bars any state's law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from requesting sensitive metadata from persons or businesses without a warrant. Also in October the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies is not sufficiently protected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/super/">Connecticut Superior Court</a> [official website] Judge Barbara Bellis on Thursday <a href="http://civilinquiry.jud.ct.gov/DocumentInquiry/DocumentInquiry.aspx?DocumentNo=10333999">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [opinion, PDF] raised by three gun companies who are being sued by families affected by the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. The ten families <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/jurist-several-states-have-enacted.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] the civil action against the companies for manufacturing, distributing, and selling Bushmaster semi-automatic AR-15 rifles, the weapon used by the Sandy Hook shooter. Defendants <a href="http://www.remington.com/">Remington Arms</a>, <a href="https://www.camfour.com/">Camfour</a>, and Riverview Guns Sales [official websites] attempted to dismiss the case last December by claiming that the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s397enr/pdf/BILLS-109s397enr.pdf">Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act</a> (PLCAA) [text, PDF] grants them immunity from civil liability cases. However, Bellis allowed the case to proceed upon consideration of the families' legal claim that the gun companies may have negligently promoted a weapon too dangerous for civilian use. The opposing parties plan to meet next Tuesday and proceed with the matter.</p>

<p>Since the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, the Connecticut legislature has tightened gun laws while the families of victims have called for gun control. In October, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Connecticut and New York's gun control legislation that bans semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines. A judge for the US District Court for the District of Connecticut in January 2014 <a href="http://howappealing.abovethelaw.com/ShewVsMalloy-DConn-013014.pdf">upheld</a> [ruling, PDF] the constitutionality of the state's new <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/s/pdf/2013SB-01160-R00-SB.pdf">gun control law</a> [text, PDF], while still acknowledging the Second Amendment rights of gun owners. The new law, enacted in response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/federal-judge-upholds-connecticut-gun-control-law.php">expanded a previous ban</a> [JURIST report] on assault weapons and introduced a prohibition on high-capacity ammunition magazines. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/2dca.htm">Second District Court of Appeal</a> [official website] for the state of California <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B258589.PDF">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the state's teacher tenure law on Thursday, overturning a lower court's 2014 <a href="http://studentsmatter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Tenative-Decision.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF]. Those opposing the law claimed that providing teachers strong job security after 18 months affected students' fundamental right to education. The appeals court determined that their judicial responsibility was simply to determine whether the statue is constitutional, and said that the evidence provided did not show that the challenged statute inevitability caused a negative impact on students' right to education. The plaintiffs will appeal this ruling to the Supreme Court of California. </p>

<p>In recent years legislation surrounding education and teachers has generated controversy in the US. Earlier this week, an education reform group <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/education-reform-group-challenges-minnesota-teacher-tenure-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota law governing teacher tenure, claiming it resulted in poor educators. In August 2014 education advocacy groups in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/new-york-advocacy-groups-challenge-teacher-tenure.php">challenged the state's teacher tenure laws</a> [JURIST report], claiming that laws protecting teacher employment violate the civil rights of children to a quality education. In June 2014 a judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that the California's system for tenure and seniority for public school teachers is <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/alifornia-court-strikes-down-teacher-tenure-system.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the state's legislature violated the Kansas constitution when it <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kansas-high-court-finds-public-school-funding-reductions-unconstitutional.php">underfunded K-12 public education</a> [JURIST report] during the 2009 through 2012 school years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Supreme Federal Court of Brazil</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on Friday denied <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rousseff's</a> [BBC profile] injunction request to suspend an upcoming lower house vote regarding her looming impeachment. A lower house committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-legislative-committee-votes-to-recommend-presidents-impeachment.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to recommend her impeachment, and a two-thirds majority vote will be required on Sunday to approve the action. Should the lower house approve impeachment, the Senate will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-idUSKCN0XB1XH">vote</a> [Reuters report] on whether to put Rousseff on trial for budget law violations. It is expected that she will stand trial for about six months and Vice President Michel Temer will replace her as soon as early May. While the <a href="http://pmdb.org.br/">Brazilian Democratic Movement Party </a>(PMDB) [official website, in Portuguese] has suggested that they will vote for impeachment, Rousseff's <a href="http://www.pt.org.br/">Workers' Party</a> (PT) [official website, in Portuguese] has expressed concern that such an action would throw the country into chaos. Rousseff's impeachment would bring an end to the PT's 13-year long control of the Brazilian government.</p>

<p>Last week the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer. In December the Supreme Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on two measures to set the stage for impeachment proceedings against Rousseff: one requiring the re-formation of a congressional committee set up to guide Rousseff's impeachment through Congress, and the other giving the Senate power to review a lower house vote for impeachment. Rousseff's opposition <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval. Rousseff argued that the opposition is trying to impeach her to hinder government actions.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A long-awaited <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=8183660">bill</a> [text] legalizing physician-assisted suicide was introduced before the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Default.aspx?Language=E">Parliament of Canada</a> [official website] on Thursday and is now awaiting passage through the House of Commons and the Senate. This <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/14/474231723/canadas-government-introduces-bill-to-legalize-physician-assisted-suicide">development</a> [NPR report] comes over a year after the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/canadian-supreme-court-authorizes-medically-assisted-suicide.php">struck down a ban</a> [JURIST report] on the practice, and after emotional advocacy by Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a> [official website]. Trudeau's father, former Prime Minister <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Elliott-Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> [Britannica profile], died in 2000 of prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease. Trudeau stated his father would have liked to end his life with dignity. The bill labels the practice as "medical assistance in dying," as opposed to suicide and primarily targets the incurably ill. It requires medical approval, mandates a 15-day waiting period and lists eligibility criteria. Among other things, the person applying for medically assisted death must be or would soon be eligible for government-funded health care, must be mentally competent adult of 18 years of age or older, must have a grievous and irremediable medical condition and must give voluntarily informed consent for medically assisted death. The Supreme Court had initially given a one-year deadline to enact the law but the previous conservative government did not make much progress. It will now go through the parliament before final enactment. </p>

<p>The aid-in-dying movement has garnered substantial legal debate around the world in the past few years. In the US, four states currently have legislation that allow physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to some patients: California, Oregon, Washington and Vermont. In Montana the state's highest court has ruled that assisted suicide is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">not explicitly banned</a> [JURIST report] by state law or public policy, meaning consent could be raised as a defense in a potential prosecution of a physician. In July California lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/california-lawmakers-drop-right-to-die-bill.php">ended a previous legislative effort</a> [JURIST report] to enact similar legislation, as the former right-to-die bill had been amended several times over the previous year. The law was hotly debated when 29-year-old <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/opinion/maynard-assisted-suicide-cancer-dignity/">Brittany Maynard</a> [CNN backgrounder] moved from San Francisco to Oregon, which allows physician-assisted suicide, so that she could die on her own terms after being diagnosed with brain cancer. In June the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/europe-rights-court-backs-france-decision-upholding-paralyzed-mans-right-to-die.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a French court's decision allowing Vincent Lambert the right to die, stating it did not violate article 2 of European Convention on Human Rights. In May a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/dutch-court-clears-man-who-assisted-in-dying-mothers-suicide.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother in committing suicide. Also that month, an 84-year old attorney, businessman and political candidate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/terminally-ill-nashville-lawyer-challenges-tennessee-ban-on-assisted-suicide.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Tennessee, challenging a law that makes it a felony for a doctor or another person to help someone commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tennessee Governor <a href="http://billhaslam.com">Bill Haslam</a> [official website] <a href="http://media-cdn.timesfreepress.com//news/documents/2016/04/14/1153001873480555.pdf">vetoed</a> [statement] a controversial bill on Friday that would have made the Bible the state's official book. Haslam stated that the bill violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution as well as Article 1, Section 3 of the Tennessee Constitution which states that no preference shall be given by law to any religious establishment or mode of worship. The bill passed through the Senate and barely passed through the House last year. The legislature may still override the veto rather easily, as it would require the same number of votes it took to originally pass the bill through the House and Senate.</p>

<p>Throughout the country religion continues to raise controversial First Amendment questions. Earlier this week, a California federal judge required Los Angeles County to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/california-federal-judge-orders-removal-of-cross-from-la-county-seal.php">remove</a> [JURIST report] a Latin cross from the county seal. In November a judge for the <a href="http://www.arwd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas</a> [official website] ruled that a nativity scene on Baxter County Courthouse grounds <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-courthouse-nativity-scene.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In September the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a six-foot-tall statue of Jesus may <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-religious-statue-to-remain-on-national-forest-land.php">remain</a> [JURIST report] on US Forest Service land. Last May the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-city-prohibition-on-park-nativity-scene.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Santa Monica city ordinance prohibiting unattended exhibits, including Nativity scenes, in Palisades Park. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/570dfb126.html">expressed concerns</a> [press release] on Wednesday over the fighting between Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) army and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebel forces, which has caused tens of thousands of people in the eastern DRC region to become intentionally displaced. Between late March and late last week, approximately 36,000 people were forced out of the Mpati, Kivuye, Nyange and Bweru sites, three of which were managed by UNHCR through a local partner in the Masisi district of DRC's North Kivu province. While many have found refuge in other UNHCR-supported sites for internally displaced people (IDP), some are still camping in schools and churches and sleeping in banana fields near the vacated sites without adequate shelter. According to UNHCR, there are approximately 1.5 million IDPs in DRC, including more than a half-million in North Kivu. UNHCR is further worried that additional sites may be affected as the DRC army continues operations against the rebel FDLR and allied armed groups. UNHCR Regional Representative Stefano Severe urged "the authorities and the rival parties to ensure that the basic human rights of displaced people are respected and that they are found safe alternative shelter." Severe stated that "Many are extremely vulnerable and were living in extreme poverty" and expressed his concerns over lack of food and access to health care for the displaced. </p>

<p>The DRC and surrounding regions have seen a high level of conflict in the past several decades contributing to increased concerns about human rights abuses and displacement of civilians. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-top-officials-over-human-rights-violations-in-congo.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] Friday over reports coming out of the DRC regarding an apparent government security operation in an area of southern Brazzaville known as the Pool. In January Ban urged African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-sg-urges-african-leaders-to-avoid-using-loopholes-to-cling-to-power.php">"cling to power"</a> [JURIST report]. In October voters in DRC approved an amendment to the <a href="http://www.presidence.cg/files/my_files/constit200102.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF, in French] to allow President Denis Sassou Nguesso to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-voters-approve-referendum-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">extend his term in office</a> [JURIST report]. The amendment allows presidents to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-government-announces-referendum-on-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">renew</a> [JURIST report] their term twice and removes the age limit for presidential candidates, currently set at 70. Nguesso, who is 72, would have been ineligible for the presidency without the amendment. The constitutional amendment was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-drc-using-excessive-force-against-protestors.php">marked by protests and demonstrations</a> [JURIST report] in January 2015 across the DRC and the government was accused of using excessive force against these protesters. In October 2014 the UN issued a <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-report-finds-violations-in-dr-congo.php">report</a> [JURIST report]  that addressed the human rights violations taking place in connection with Operation Likofi. In July 2014 <a href="https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org">UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict</a> [official website] presented a report outlining the situation of the child in the DRC, which found the <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/recruitment-of-child-soldiers-persists-in-drc-un-report.php">recruitment of child soldiers</a> [JURIST report] persists. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two independent human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19822&LangID=E">called upon</a> [press release] the UN Friday to put into motion a <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/hrap/Eng/Cases%20Eng/26-08%20NM%20etal%20Opinion%20FINAL%2026feb16.pdf">plan</a> [text, PDF] to redress damages suffered by internationally displaced persons who were exposed to lead poisoning at camps settled by the <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/pages/default.aspx">UN Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) [website] in 1998 and 1999. Special Rapporteurs <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Minorities/SRMinorities/Pages/RitaIzsak.aspx">Rita Izsák-Ndiaye</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/ChalokaBeyani.aspx">Chaloka Beyani</a> [official profiles] also urged the UN to take responsibility for its actions leading to noncompliance with international obligations. When the UNMIK first found high levels of lead among those living in the camps, it failed to adequately remedy the situation and did not evacuate the camps of vulnerable people until 2004. The camps were set up for people displaced by armed conflict in the region and were established too close to a mining operation, which led to the contamination. Originally, the facilities were intended to last for months, but ultimately lasted for years and often times lacked basic resources.  The experts recommend that the UN acknowledge their failures and make a public apology.</p>

<p>Kosovo has been confronted with numerous lasting effects of the Kosovo War since declaring independence from Serbia beginning in 1998. Relations between Serbia and Kosovo remain strained. In response to the widespread commission of war crimes during the conflict in Kosovo, the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/">EU's justice mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">created in 2008</a> [JURIST report] to assist in the effort of bringing perpetrators to justice. In February the Basic Court of Pec, a region in western Kosovo, issued an indictment charging 14 Serbians in the region with committing <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/14-serbians-indicted-in-kosovo-on-war-crimes-charges.php">war crimes in 1999</a> [JURIST report]. A EULEX prosecutor in the Kosovo Special Prosecution Office filed an <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/sprk-indicts-15-for-war-crimes-at-kla-detention-center-in-1998.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] against 15 defendants in November 2014 in the EULEX Mitrovica Basic Court. The individuals were accused of war crimes against civilians that occurred at a Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) detention center in Likovac in 1998. War crimes committed during the Kosovo War have been prosecuted in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the establishment of a Kosovan war crimes court in The Hague was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/kosovo-war-crimes-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights experts: Chile should establish national body to prevent torture</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A delegation from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/OPCAT/Pages/OPCATIndex.aspx">Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture</a> (SPT) [official website] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19820&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] the Chilean government Thursday to establish a national independent body to monitor "places of detention." The SPT monitors how states are meeting their treaty obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and was in Chile between April 4 and 13 for that purpose. Chile ratified the OPCAT in 2008 and "should have set up a monitoring body known as a National Prevention Mechanism within a year." The experts expressed concern over the delay and visited police stations, public and privately-run prisons, detention cells in the tribunals, facilities for juveniles and a psychiatric hospital. The experts held confidential and private interviews with detained people, law enforcement officials, and medical staff. Although the delegation expressed that the creation of a national independent body was the "first step" to preventing torture and ill-treatment in detention, the delegation recognized that the country has been promoting technical assistance for the ratification and implementation to states of the Convention against Torture. </p>

<p>Chile has served as a model for Latin America in regards to human rights and social policy innovations. Earlier this month though, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Kishore Singh, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-expert-urges-chile-to-make-education-reforms.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Chilean authorities to implement a sustainable model to education. Chile has also begun the process of drafting a new constitution in order to reflect the ideals of democracy and not its dictatorship when the current draft was written. The process <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/chile-president-announces-process-to-create-new-constitution.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in October, and the new constitution will be presented to Congress in the second half of 2017. In March 2015 the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-warns-of-pervasive-poverty-in-chile.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that poverty in Chile remained under the radar for many policy-makers in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN experts <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19823&LangID=E">commended</a> [press release] Tunisia Friday on the implementation of the National Preventive Mechanism (NPM), a torture prevention body, and recommended that officials ensure that the delegates are "well-resourced and able to function in the shortest time possible." The experts visited the country from April 12-14. Tunisia has been taking steps toward creating the commission since 2011 when the nation ratified the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPCAT.aspx">Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture</a> (OPCAT) [text]. The experts expressed concern over receiving adequate financial aid to sustain the operation, as well as concerns about how the body will integrate with other government bodies and practices. Hans-Jörg Bannwart, the lead expert on the UN mission to Tunisia said, "[t]his engagement and commitment from all parties involved in this process is hugely encouraging." Tunisia is the first nation North Africa and the Middle East region to implement an NPM as part of ratifying the OPCAT. </p>

<p>In 2013 Tunisia adopted the Instance Nationale de Prevention de la Torture, which is the required legislation the nation needed to begin the process for forming the NPM. The law establishing the organization was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-chief-applauds-new-tunisia-anti-torture-body.php">passed unanimously</a> [JURIST report]. At that time, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46247#.VxEtuvkrLIU">said</a> [press release], "The adoption of this law is an important milestone during the ongoing transition in Tunisia, and in particular in the effort to bring the country in line with international rule of law and human rights norms and standards." Tunisia has faced political turmoil since president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ge Yongxi, a civil rights defense lawyer, was detained and released late Friday by Chinese authorities for posts on social media that "poked fun" at President Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers. Ge posted an image of the president on WeChat, a messaging service, along with Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin in a body of water with the words, "The Panama River," "It is really deep," "So easy to get drowned," and "Don't be scared, I have a brother-in-law." The president's brother-in-law, Deng Jiagui, was named&#8212;along with a handful of elite Chinese citizens&#8212;in the data leak from a Panamanian law firm that exposed offshore accounts held by prominent politicians and others across the globe. Information about the Panama Papers has been <a href="http://chrdnet.com">censored</a> [advocacy website] across China with websites in that country "<a href="http://dailysignal.com/2016/04/13/why-you-cant-google-panama-papers-in-china/">forbidden</a>" [Daily Signal report] from publishing material about the subject. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36055000">Ge was also detained</a> [BBC report] 10 months ago for defending another lawyer and questioned by authorities for being involved in a lawyers' rights movement. </p>

<p>Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon announced Wednesday that his license to practice law was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] by the judicial bureau. Chinese lawyer and professor Chen Taihe <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">fled China</a> [JURIST report] in March and arrived in San Leandro, California, after he was detained last July as part of a crackdown on rights lawyers. The crackdown culminated in at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in February over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">United Nations Security Council</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53698#.VxJIg5MrLJg">strongly condemned</a> [UN statement] the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) attempt to fire a ballistic missile in clear violation of UN resolutions. Referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Security Council renewed its commitment to "continue to closely monitor the situation [in the DPRK] and take further significant measures in line with the Council's previously expressed determination." Those determinations come in the form of a host of <a href="https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/sanctions/1718">prior resolutions</a> [sanctions committee backgrounder] seeking to limit the nation's tactical capabilities, including an export ban and asset freeze applied in March. </p>

<p>North Korea has been UN radar over the past few months over both its missile tests and its human rights violations. In March, North Korea defied UN and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/president-obama-issues-executive-order-sanctioning-north-korea.php">US sanctions</a> [JURIST report] by firing a medium-range ballistic missile into the sea. In February, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-sg-condemns-north-korea-missile-launch.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for violating international obligations after another missile launch was conducted. In January the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-house-approves-bill-to-sanction-north-korea-following-nuclear-test.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would increase sanctions against North Korea for its continuation of nuclear testing. In November Japan and the EU <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/japan-eu-circulate-un-draft-resolution-referring-north-korea-to-icc.php">circulated</a> [JURIST report] a draft UN resolution condemning North Korea's human rights abuses and encouraging the UN Security Council to refer the country to the International Criminal Court, noting reports of torture, limits on freedom of mobility, restrictions on freedom of speech, restrictions on freedom of religion, privacy infringement, arbitrary imprisonment, prison camps and more. The year before, the UN Special Rapporteur Marzuki Darusman said that there is enough evidence to <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-expert-enough-evidence-to-hold-north-korea-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">hold Kim Jong-un responsible</a> [JURIST report] for "massive" human rights atrocities committed in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Guatemalan <a href="http://www.pgn.gob.gt/">Attorney General Thelma Aldana</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.publinews.gt/nacionales/thelma-aldana-fiscal-general-es-un-caso-lamentable-esta-involucrado-otto-perez-y-baldetti/Tetpdo---DYT69HJj4ixYo/">accused</a> [PublicNews story, in Spanish] former Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina of accepting part of a $25 million bribe while in office. Pérez Molina, who is already awaiting trial on conspiracy charges filed after he was forced out of office in 2015, stands accused of accepting a bribe in exchange for helping Terminal de Contenedores Barcelona (TCB), a Spanish company, win a 25-year contract to operate a container terminal in Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala. Along with Pérez Molina, authorities arrested former Vice President Roxana Baldetti, TCB's Juan Jose Suarez and eight other Guatemalan former government officials. </p>

<p>In December, Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/guatemala-ex-president-charged-in-corruption-scandal.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] by prosecutors, suspected of illicit association, customs fraud and bribery. Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-ex-president-detained-pending-corruption-investigation.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] pending investigation in September following an indictment over corruption charges. Also in September, Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-resigns-under-corruption-allegations.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/09/03/pais/la-carta-de-dimision-de-otto-perez-al-cargo-de-presidente-de-guatemala/">letter</a> [El Periódico materials, in Spanish] to both the Guatemalan congress and reporters announcing his resignation and his intention to "stand before justice." The day before his resignation, Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-stripped-of-immunity.php">stripped of his presidential immunity</a> [JURIST report] by a unanimous vote by congress. After Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-president-refuses-to-resign-amid-corruption-allegations.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in August that he had no plans to resign, Guatemala's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach the president.<div style="text-align: center;"></div></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several aid organizations urged EU leaders on Thursday to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en">Oxfam</a>, <a href="http://www.nrc.no/">Norwegian Refugee Council</a> and <a href="http://www.solidaritynow.org/index_en.html">Solidarity Now</a> [advocacy websites] took part in the joint letter. The deportations are part of a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">deal</a> [JURIST report] struck last month between Turkey and EU leaders in which all migrants crossing the Aegean into Greece would be sent back to Turkey. The <a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/deportations-of-refugees-and-migrants-from-greece-must-be-halted-as-fears-of-human-rights-violations-grow/">rights groups report</a> [press release] that thousands of migrants are being held in detention camps in Greece and many are returned to Turkey without proper asylum hearings. The "fast-track" expedited asylum hearings adopted by Greece are also of concern, they say, because important decisions and examinations concerning asylum are made by understaffed agencies in only one day. The rights groups are also calling for EU to open all camps housing asylum seekers, increase the number of asylum officers in Greece and improve security in the facilities.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issue around the world. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti refugee sentiments. An independent UN human rights expert in March encouraged EU leaders to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">remain</a> [JURIST report] steadfast in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU and to avoid making Turkey the "gatekeeper." Also in March <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] Executive Director Kenneth Roth <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-leaders-urged-to-reject-migrant-deal-with-turkey.php">urged EU leaders</a> [JURIST report] to reject a proposed EU Joint Action Plan with Turkey to handle the influx of migrants due to the "disregard for international law covering the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, told the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] on Friday that Yemen is at a "critical crossroads" as peace talks between the government and the Houthis are scheduled to begin this Monday. Ould Cheikh Ahmed says he <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53697#.VxKVRtQrLIU">hopes the talks will lead to an agreement</a> [UN News Centre report] and an end to violence in the country. Last week, both parties agreed to a cessation of hostilities and Ould Cheikh Ahmed hopes this will create a good environment to agree to end the conflict and resume inclusive political dialogue. The UN Envoy urged all parties to support the work of humanitarian agencies, which he says will continue to provide assistance in the area. He also commended the government of Saudi Arabia for their role in encouraging the parties to stop hostilities and in agreeing to settle border disputes. Over 6,400 people have died so far in the conflict and over 2.8 million people have been displaced.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-yemen-conflict-to-swallow-their-pride.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Saudi Arabian coalition forces in Yemen for the more than 3,000 civilian casualties resulting from the conflict in just the past year. Also in March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the civilian death toll in Yemen had reached nearly 2,800. In January the UN World Food Programme appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php">allow the safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October Amnesty International called for an <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php"> [JURIST report] independent investigation into possible war crimes</a> surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/722845/detainee-transfers-announced">announced</a> [press release] the transfer of 9 Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainees to Saudi Arabia on Saturday as they continue their efforts to close the facility. They would have sent the prisoners back to their home country but the instability in Yemen made <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f05bfc64420e4d68bfbd318ed55e69bb/us-frees-9-guantanamo-prisoners-sends-them-saudi-arabia">transfer to Saudi Arabia</a> [AP report] inevitable. Eight of the 9 detainees had been cleared for release since 2009, after an extensive review, and 26 more detainees are also cleared and expected to be released this summer. At the end of March, a US government official said the DOD told Congress that it <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-government-official-announces-guantanamo-detainee-transfers.php">plans to transfer</a> [JURIST report] as many as 12 prisoners from Guantanamo in the coming weeks. Eighty detainees remain at the facility.</p>

<p>In February US President Obama delivered a plan to Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">close Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. In early April, The DOD <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/2-guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-senegal.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of two Guantanamo detainees to Senegal. Libyan nationals Salem Abdu Salam Ghereby, 55, and Omar Khalif Mohammed Abu Baker Mahjour, about 44, were released after being held nearly 14 years without charges.The DOD <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">said</a> [JURIST report] last year they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/EN/AngelaMerkel/angela_merkel_node.html;jsessionid=5456D31DC4D187819401A890A288622C.s1t1">German Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website] announced on Friday she will allow a criminal inquiry to proceed against German comedian Jan Boehmermann after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a complaint. The comedian made sexual references to Erdogan on the <a href="http://www.zdf.de">public television station ZDF</a> [official website] two weeks ago and could be prosecuted under a rarely used <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1035">section of the German criminal code</a> [text] which allows prosecution for defamation of officials of foreign state. The relevant section of the code states <blockquote>Whosoever insults a foreign head of state, or, with respect to his position, a member of a foreign government who is in Germany in his official capacity, or a head of a foreign diplomatic mission who is accredited in the Federal territory shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three years or a fine, in case of a slanderous insult to imprisonment from three months to five years.</blockquote> Experts <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36055488">believe</a> [BBC report] he may have a strong defense against the charges due to the fact that the sexual references were part of a long satirical poem. Merkel has said she will attempt to repeal the law in the coming year.</p>

<p>Turkey has been accused of violating human rights freedoms on numerous recent occasions. In December the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/europe-rights-court-turkish-youtube-ban-violated-freedom-of-expression.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that a Turkish court order blocking access to YouTube violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In April a prosecutor in Turkey <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/turkish-prosecutor-orders-blocking-of-social-media-sites.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Internet providers to block social networking sites including Twitter and YouTube. In September 2014 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/turkish-government-weakening-rule-of-law-hrw.php">reported </a>[JURIST report] that Turkey's ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/site/">Justice and Development Party</a> [party website] was taking steps to weaken the rule of law, control Internet and media and suppress critics and protesters. In April 2014 the Turkish government lifted a <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/turkish-authorities-lift-twitter-ban-following-court-ruling.php">ban</a> [JURIST report] on Twitter following a Constitutional Court ruling stating that the ban violated both individual rights as well as the freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] People began protesting in Baghdad this weekend demanding a new government amid the third parliament session cancelled this week as officials discuss political reforms. The session of parliament was cancelled because the chambers <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/iraq-political-crisis-160416105131271.html">could not be secured</a> [Aljazeera report] by forces as tempers flared again. The political turmoil has been the result of a plan by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/world/meast/iraq-haider-al-abadi/">Haider al-Abadi</a> [CNN profile] to bring technocrats into the cabinet in order to bring down corruption. On March 31, al-Abadi presented a list of people to attempt to accomplish this, but then drafted a second list after political pressure that was more in line with party's wishes. Many MP's then staged a sit-in protest of this move, as they believed it would allow corruption to continue. </p>

<p>Iraq has faced significant challenges in recent years with providing basic infrastructure and a stable government. Last week, members of parliament <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/iraq-mps-vote-parliamentary-speaker-row-heats-160414112239485.html">voted to remove</a> [Aljazeera report] the parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi after accusing him of blocking reforms. The move was one of many cabinet membership questions that have led to chaos in the chambers. In August Iraq's cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/iraq-cabinet-approves-measures-to-reduce-top-positions-fight-corruption.php">approved a proposal</a> [JURIST report] by al-Abadi to reduce the number of top political positions, decrease spending, and restart a corruption investigation program. A vice presidential position currently held by former prime minister Nouri Al Maliki was among those to be eliminated. Those in favor of the changes say <a href="http://gulfnews.com/opinion/editorials/al-abadi-s-reforms-necessary-for-iraq-1.1563697">they are needed</a> [Gulf News op-ed] for the government to operate more effectively, but opponents who broadly support change worry that they <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/08/09/Iraq-s-Abadi-abolishes-Vice-President-and-Deputy-PM-posts.html">concentrate too much power</a> [Al Arabiya report] in Al Abadi. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Gambian activist on Saturday died while in detention after being detained on Thursday following protesting. Many rights groups are now <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36064276">calling for an inquiry</a> [BBC report] into how Solo Sandeng, the National Organizing Secretary of the opposition United Democratic Party (UDP), died after sustaining injuries during the protest. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/gambia-death-in-detention-of-key-political-activist/">stated</a> [AI report] that the organization has received information that he "died in detention shortly after his arrest for participating in a peaceful protest" and that the circumstances surrounding his death are still unknown. People present at the protest, which was in regards to electoral reforms, stated that it was peaceful and was eventually broken up by police who arrested several people, including Sandeng. On Sunday, after learning of the deaths of Sandeng and two others, UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53702#.VxPVXTArKUk">called on</a> [UN news report] authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those arrested during Thursday's protest. </p>

<p>The treatment of activists has been a constant human rights issue throughout the world. Last month Azeri human rights lawyer and advocate Intigam Aliyev <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/azerbaijan-releases-human-rights-activist-from-jail.php">was freed from jail</a> [JURIST report]. Aliyev had been charged with tax evasion, abuse of office and illegal entrepreneurship. Also in March Kuwait's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kuwait-top-court-upholds-4-year-sentence-for-insulting-judges-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the four-year jail sentence against an activist found guilty of insulting judges on Twitter. In February Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-criticizes-oman-for-jailing-social-media-activists.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Omani courts for jailing two online activists over posts they wrote on social media websites. Also in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. The commissioner stated that civil society workers should be protected by the state, not harassed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The lower house of Brazil's <a href="http://www.congressonacional.leg.br/portal/">National Congress</a> [official website] on Sunday <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/POLITICA/507325-CAMARA-AUTORIZA-INSTAURACAO-DE-PROCESSO-DE-IMPEACHMENT-DE-DILMA-COM-367-VOTOS-A-FAVOR-E-137-CONTRA.html">voted in favor of impeachment</a> [press release, in Portuguese] of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [BBC profile] for manipulating government accounts. The Chamber of Deputies voted for impeachment by the required two-thirds majority, splitting 367 to 137. The matter now moves to the upper house, whose 81 members will vote by simple majority whether to hold a trial. That vote is expected in May.</p>

<p>Last week the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-denies-presidents-last-attempt-to-avoid-impeachment.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the president's request for an injunction to suspend the impeachment vote. Previously the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer. In December the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on two measures to set the stage for impeachment proceedings against Rousseff: one requiring the re-formation of a congressional committee set up to guide Rousseff's impeachment through Congress, and the other giving the Senate power to review a lower house vote for impeachment. Rousseff's opposition <a href="ht/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval. Rousseff argued that the opposition is trying to impeach her to hinder government actions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme People's Court of China on Monday <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/18/c_135289949.htm">clarified</a> [Xinhua report] that the maximum penalty for the crime of corruption in the form of embezzlement or accepting bribes amounting to high sums of money will be the death penalty. The notice by the China high court explained that in an extremely serious case, bribes and the act of embezzling funds at the amount of 3 million yuan (USD $463,000) will allow for a maximum penalty of capital punishment. The statement provided that there are mitigating factors that may suspend ones sentence to death and that court's will be lenient to individuals who have cooperated with investigators. Additionally, if the death penalty is considered to harsh for a specific convict, then a life sentence without parole will be issued as an appropriate sentence. The decision by the China high court comes as many corruption cases have recently flooded the country's courts.</p>

<p>The Chinese government has increased the prosecution of domestic corruption increased following the appointment of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11551399">President Xi Jinping</a> [BBC profile] in 2013. In February the Hangzhou Christian Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/prominent-china-pastor-under-investigation-for-corruption.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that a prominent Chinese Pastor is under investigation for corruption involving the embezzlement of state funds. In November a Chinese court <a href="ht/paperchase/2015/11/china-court-jails-top-aide-to-former-security-chief-for-corruption.php">jailed a top aide to the country's former security chief</a> [JURIST report] Zhou Yongkang on corruption charges. In October Chinese state media reported that the former head of the country's biggest oil firm was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/former-china-oil-firm-chairman-jailed-for-corruption.php">sentenced to 16 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for corruption. In September prosecutors in China announced that they will be investigating former China Supreme Court justice Xi Xiaoming on <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-china-senior-judge-to-be-prosecuted-for-corruption.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report]. In August a former general in China's People's Liberation Army, Gu Junshan, was <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/china-court-sentences-former-general-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by a Chinese military court to death with a two year reprieve for corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/governor-tom-wolf/">Governor Tom Wolf</a> [official profile] signed a <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billInfo/billInfo.cfm?sYear=2015&sInd=0&body=S&type=B&bn=0003">bill</a> [materials] on Sunday legalizing medical marijuana. The bill <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/governor-wolf-signs-medical-marijuana-legalization-bill-into-law/">establishes</a> [press release] a statewide program, which will take 18 to 24 months to implement and will allow patients with serious medical problems to receive medical marijuana from state dispensaries after receiving physician certification. Though implementation will take up to two years, parents will be able to <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/04/pennsylvania-launches-medical-marijuana-program.html">administer</a> [AP report] medical marijuana to children in need immediately. The <a href="http://www.health.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Pennsylvania Department of Health</a> [official website] has begun conducting population studies, collaborating with medical professionals, and working on temporary regulations and the application process to meet the statute's 6 month publishing requirement and ready dispensaries. This bill makes Pennsylvania the twenty-fourth state to legalize and establish a medical marijuana program. </p>

<p>In February the Utah Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/utah-senate-advances-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">voted to advance a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize the use of medical marijuana in various forms such as vapor or edible form. In December Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] fully legalizing medical marijuana in the country. Last November New York Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-york-governor-signs-emergency-medical-marijuana-bills.php">signed two bills</a> [JURIST report] in order to expedite the distribution of medical marijuana to citizens with critical health conditions. Earlier that month New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill-allowing-medical-marijuana-on-school-grounds-for-disabled-students.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that would allow for the administering of edible medical marijuana to sick and disabled children on school grounds without triggering the arrests of parents or educators. In June of last year the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a law <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">restricting the use of medical marijuana was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-6418_2q24.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-1 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/welch-v-united-states-2/">Welch v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the court's 2015 decision in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/13-7120.pdf">Johnson v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF] created a substantive rule of constitutional law and the holding applies retroactively to cases that are on collateral review. The case involves petitioner Gregory Welch, a convicted felon who was sentenced to heightened penalties under 18 USC &#167; 924(e), the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (Act) [text], for the commission of a violent felony as defined in the act. Welch was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, after three prior violent convictions. In <span class="casename">Johnson</span> the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-decides-increased-sentences-under-the-armed-career-criminal-act-unconstitutional.php">court ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the residual clause of 18 USC &#167; 924(e) was unconstitutional under the void for vagueness doctrine. Welch's original petition for <em>certiorari</em> was denied by the court in 2013, but his case made it to the Supreme Court by seeking a review of the denial of a certificate of appealability with the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Monday's decision affirms that <span class="casename">Johnson</span> is retroactive in cases on collateral review. Welch's case is now remanded to the Eleventh Circuit for review of his sentence under the Act. </p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-felonies-agency-actions.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-6418_mlho.pdf">transcript</a>, PDF] in this case in March. <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-retroactivity-of-armed-career-criminal-act-decision.php"><em>Certiorari</em> was granted</a> [JURIST report] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladesh's minister of law on Sunday told the press that the arrest of a well-known magazine editor, Shafik Rahman, was not politically motivated. Recently, Rahman was named the convener of the international affairs committee for the opposition Bangladesh National Party. Rahman was apprehended on Saturday. The law minister, Anisul Huq, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/bangladesh-denies-editor-arrest-politically-motivated-160417121943419.html">denied the arrest was tied to politics</a> [Al Jazeera report].</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Human Rights Watch reported that Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-millions-in-bangladesh-affected-by-arsenic-poisoning-in-water.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] to respond adequately to naturally occurring arsenic in rural drinking water. The report found that the government's efforts to combat water-contamination has drastically fallen off since 2006. Also in April, former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/former-bangladesh-pm-granted-bail-in-bus-attack-case.php">surrendered to a court</a> [JURIST report] after an arrest warrant was issued against her in connection with the firebombing bus attack last year staged in opposition of the government. In March the Bangladesh high court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-high-court-denies-petition-to-remove-islam-as-state-religion.php">threw out a petition</a> [JURIST report] introduced by secular activists that sought the removal of Islam as the state religion. In January the high court of Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/bangladesh-top-court-upholds-death-sentence-against-islamist-leader.php">upheld the death sentence of Motiur Rahman Nizami for war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed in the country's war for independence against Pakistan in 1971. Nizami's conviction was upheld on charges of genocide, murder, torture, and rape.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New data from a South Korean think-tank shows that despite minor progress in certain areas, UN efforts at improving human rights in North Korea have not led to real improvement. The <a href="http://nkdb.org/en/main.php">Database Center for North Korean Human Rights</a> (NKDB) [official website] <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160418000845">analyzed 52,735 cases</a> [<em>Korea Herald</em> report] according to nine categories specified by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/CommissionInquiryonHRinDPRK.aspx">Commission of Inquiry</a> (COI) report in order to track any developments in the past two years. Although there were signs of minor progress for access to food and imprisonment, almost half of the cases constituted arbitrary detention. Other areas saw increases under the continued Kim regime as well, including violations of the right to life, violations of the right to movement, and enforced disappearances. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/12/north-korea-kim-il-sungs-catastrophic-rights-legacy">statement</a> [text] last week discussing these matters:<blockquote>Kim Il-Sung's rule was based on ruthless rights abuses, including frequent use of enforced disappearances and deadly prison camps to inflict fear and repress any voices challenging his rule. ... The man is dead, but his brainwashing and horrific abuses live on. Kim Jong-Un is following right along in his grandfather's footsteps.</blockquote>The COI is not the only way the UN has addressed this issue. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) has also passed resolutions condemning the violations, and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official websites] has formally addressed the issue on its agenda the past two years.</p>

<p>North Korea has been an international source of concern due to the country's human rights record and instability. Last month UN human rights investigator <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/MarzukiDarusman.aspx">Marzuki Darusman</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17218&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the UNHRC to push for the prosecution of top North Korean government officials for <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-calls-for-prosecution-of-top-north-korea-officials.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. In February Darusman asked the UN to provide North Korea with <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-expert-asks-un-to-notify-north-korea-of-crimes-against-humanity-probe.php">notice</a> [JURIST report] that Kim Jong Un may be investigated for crimes against humanity. The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in January <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/house-votes-toughen-north-korea-sanctions">approved</a> [press release] legislation that would increase sanctions against North Korea for its <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-house-approves-bill-to-sanction-north-korea-following-nuclear-test.php">continuation of nuclear testing</a> [JURIST report]. Japan and the EU <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/japan-eu-circulate-un-draft-resolution-referring-north-korea-to-icc.php">circulated</a> [JURIST report] a draft UN resolution in November condemning North Korea's human rights abuses and encouraging the UN Security Council to refer the country to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website], noting reports of torture, limits on freedom of mobility, restrictions on freedom of speech, restrictions on freedom of religion, privacy infringement, arbitrary imprisonment, prison camps and more. Darusman expressed <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-expert-expresses-concern-over-north-korea-absuses.php">deep concerns</a> [JURIST report] regarding human rights violations in the country just a month earlier. In November 2014 Darusman said that there is enough evidence to hold Kim Jong-un responsible for "massive" <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-expert-enough-evidence-to-hold-north-korea-accountable-for-human-rights-violations.php">human rights atrocities</a> [JURIST report] committed in the country. In response to these concerns, the UN opened a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-opens-north-korea-rights-office-in-seoul.php">new office</a> [JURIST report] in Seoul in June 2015 to specifically monitor human rights in North Korea.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Italian referendum held on Sunday failed to draw enough votes to shorten the number of currently existing offshore oil and drilling sites for environmental purposes. If the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-oildrilling-idUSKCN0XE086">referendum</a> [Reuters report] had successfully achieved a majority vote, drilling sites within 12 miles of the Italian coast would have been unable to renew their drilling licenses. Such a vote would have closed about 44 drilling sites mostly run by the Italian energy company <a href="http://www.eni.com/en_IT/home.html">Eni</a> [corporate website], thereby jeopardizing at least 11,000 jobs. The referendum only achieved a 30 percent turnout after <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25265945">Prime Minister Matteo Renzi</a> [BBC profile] called on Italian citizens to abstain from voting for the sake of the country's economic security. Following the referendum, Renzi praised the people's abstention and criticized those who backed the costly ballot despite the fact that the referendum was largely supported by his own <a href="http://www.partitodemocratico.it/">Democratic Party</a> [party website, in Italian]. </p>

<p>Renzi has recently promised political and economic reforms designed to increase stability in Italy, which has had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-italy-politics-idUSKBN0NP0TN20150504">63 governments</a> [Reuters report] since World War II. Earlier this month the Italian Parliament <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-idUSKCN0X9217">passed</a> [Reuters report] a constitutional reform promoted by Renzi intended to resolve Italy's overwhelming political instability by restricting the Senate's powers. Renzi has promised to resign from his position should the constitutional referendum, being held in October, fail to achieve a successful turnout. Last May the Italian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/italy-parliament-approves-new-electoral-overhaul.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] Renzi's new electoral rules that provide a majority of electoral seats to a clear winner of an election. He has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32584708">expressed plans</a> [BBC report] to further transform the Italian system by replacing the Senate with a non-elected body with lesser powers, as a way to provide more checks on legislation that is currently routinely held up.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN reported Monday that violence in Afghanistan has injured health and education personnel, reducing available health care and restricting children's' access to fundamental health and educational services. The <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/education_and_healthcare_at_risk.pdf">study</a> [text, PDF], prepared by <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> and the <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official websites], was complied over the course of three years and notes that there had been a distinct increase in the number of threats and obstacles placed in children's' educational and medical paths as a result of the significant conflict. The report concludes with several recommendations to enable children's unimpeded access to education and health care.</p>

<p>Human rights groups have criticized Afghanistan's record in recent years. UNAMA <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/protection-of-civilians-reports">reported in February</a> [text] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high of 11,000 in 2015. Last year the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-kunduz-clinic-airstrikes.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Kunduz hospital attack and for the results of an investigation to be made public. UNAMA and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/pages/home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-afghanistan-should-strengthen-justice-system-to-protect-women.php">also released a report</a> [JURIST report] urging Afghanistan to strengthen its criminal justice system to protect women from domestic violence. Last April an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/amnesty-urges-protection-of-afghanistan-womens-rights-activists.php">report stated</a> [JURIST report] that Afghanistan women's rights activists are facing increased violence and a lack of governmental support. In March of last year UNAMA also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-mission-in-afghanistan-reports-rise-in-civilian-casualties.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] indicating a 22 percent increase in civilian causalities in 2014, making 2014 the deadliest year in Afghanistan since 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://electionjusticeusa.org">Election Justice USA</a> [advocacy website] on Monday is filing a suit in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] claiming that the state has fraudulently changed the registration of thousands of voters which bars them from voting in the presidential primary. Election Justice spokesperson Shyla Nelson, founder of advocacy group <a href="http://www.oneearth-onevoice.org">One Voice</a>, [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ElectionJusticeUSA/posts/863949920398369:0">press release</a> [text] that the practices of the Elections Board, the named defendants, have placed "an onerous and excessive burden on the voter to prove their eligibility" that the average New Yorker does not have the time and resources to handle. The named plaintiffs were selected from a pool of individuals who reported similar discrepancies in their party registration.     </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. A partnership of voting rights groups last week <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/voting-rights-groups-sue-election-official-over-voter-registration.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="http://www.eac.gov">US Election Assistance Commission</a> [official website] stating their decision limiting the use of national voter registration in Alabama, Kansas and Georgia deprives eligible voters of the right to vote. Last month a judge for the US District Court of the Middle District of North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-judge-rules-north-carolina-voter-id-law-can-take-effect-in-march-elections.php">declined to grant</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the NAACP and other plaintiffs that would have kept the state from implementing a voter identification law in the upcoming March elections. In May the New Hampshire Supreme Court struck down [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lets-wisconsin-voter-id-law-stand.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear challenges to Wisconsin's voter ID law. Also in March Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">a new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. A <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">federal appeals court rejected </a>[JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form in November 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/041816zor_2co3.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] from an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Authors-Guild-v.-Google-Petition-w-Appendix.pdf">appeal</a> [cert petition, PDF] by three book authors and their advocacy group, the <a href="https://www.authorsguild.org/">Authors Guild</a> [official website], claiming <a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> [corporate website] was violating copyright law by scanning millions of books and placing them within an online search engine. With this denial, the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13-4829_opn.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] allowing the practice will remain in place. The Second Circuit found for Google in October, concluding that Google's book scanning initiative constituted fair use.</p>

<p>The petition was filed in December <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/google-book-scanning-project-challenged-in-supreme-court.php">claiming</a> [JURIST report] that Google, in cooperation with various university libraries, took all books off shelves and scanned them rather than buying or licensing them, reproducing them without permission. Subject to a four-part fair use test, this doctrine continues to be a contentious issue in the digital age. In September the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-bolsters-power-of-fair-use-in-copyright-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that copyright owners must consider "fair use" before demanding the removal of online materials. That case arose after Stephanie Lenz was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-google-book-scanning-is-fair-use.php">ordered to remove</a> [JURIST report] a YouTube video of her infant son dancing to Prince's hit "Lets Go Crazy." The European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/european-court-allows-library-to-digitize-but-not-disseminate-works.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in September that EU member states may authorize public libraries to digitize works contained in their collections without the consent of the rights holders. In September 2012, the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/second-circuit-suspends-google-books-case-pending-appeal-of-class-action-status.php">suspended litigation</a> [JURIST report] between the Authors Guild and Google pending an appeal of a May ruling allowing a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-allows-google-books-class-action-to-proceed.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over Google's book-scanning initiative. Both sides had tried to resolve the dispute without litigation, but their settlement agreement had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by then-Circuit Judge Denny Chin in March 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-18-16.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-674_h3dj.pdf">United States v. Texas</a> [transcript, PDF] on the Obama administration's controversial immigration policy. The question before the court is <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-texas/">whether</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] a state that provides a subsidies to undocumented immigrants has standing to challenge the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] regarding its guidance seeking to establish a process for considering deferred action for more undocumented immigrants. Under the Obama administration, DHS has long utilized a system of "deferred action," meaning it does not pursue deportation for certain illegal immigrants on a discretionary basis. In 2014 Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/secretary">Jeh Johnson</a> [official profile] issued guidance seeking a deferred action protocol be established for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for five years and either came here as children or currently have children who are US citizens or permanent residents. Twenty-six states joined the suit to challenge this guidance on the argument that it will create more immigrants with a deferred action status, and states must sustain a financial burden to maintain these individuals in their state systems. A second issue in this case is whether President Barack Obama has violated his constitutional duty in the Take Care Clause of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II, Section 3</a> [text] to to "faithfully execute" the federal immigration laws as passed by Congress.</p>

<p>This case appeals a decision by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15-40238-CV0.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision, holding that Texas does have standing and imposed an injunction temporarily banning the government from implementing the deferred action program. The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-immigration-action-this-term.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Israeli court on Tuesday convicted Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in Gaza. Haim entered an insanity plea, but the court rejected his plea stating he was aware of what he was doing at the time of the crime. The Israeli minors accompanying the man were <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/israel-court-convicts-two-minors-of-murder-of-palestinian.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] by the court in November of kidnapping Mohammed Abu Khdeir in July 2014 and then burning him to death. The murder was <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-02-04/israeli-military-seals-off-palestinian-attackers-village">supposedly in response</a> [AP report] to three Israeli teens being abducted and murdered by Hamas earlier that summer. Kdheir's murder led to an increased amount of violence in the region resulting in a 50-day war that killed more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestine conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] continues to be a significant international issue. Last month the UN rights office expressed concern over the apparent <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-office-concerned-about-extra-judicial-execution-in-west-bank.php">extrajudicial execution</a> [JURIST report] of a Palestinian man in the West Bank. In February UN rights experts urged Israel to address its use of <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-expert-accuses-israeli-forces-of-excessive-force-against-palestinians.php">excessive force</a> [JURIST report] against Palestinians and to charge or release all administrative detainees.  In August UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-officials-denounce-west-bank-arson-attack-that-killed-palestinian-child.php">urged both sides of the conflict</a> [JURIST report] to reconcile and move towards peace after an attack occurred in the West Bank village of Duma, where Jewish extremists allegedly set fire to a Palestinian home while the family slept. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19835&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] of an increase in torture and ill treatment in Burundi. In the last four months Zeid's office has recorded more than 300 new cases of torture and ill-treatment. The human rights chief asked the Burundi government to put an immediate end to these "unacceptable and illegal practices." Zeid recognized the government for releasing demonstrators who were being detained but reiterated that the increase in torture and ill-treatment was wrong. The high commissioner also condemned the targeting of members of the ruling CNDD-FDD party and the assassination of local officials.</p>

<p>Violence in Burundi began in the wake of President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, to which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] in July. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Zeid expressed concern over increased violence and rights violations in Burundi and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-calls-for-inclusive-political-dialogue-to-end-burundi-crisis.php">called for an "inclusive political dialogue"</a> [JURIST report] to end the 11-year struggle. Speaking to the council about his trip to Burundi last month, the secretary-general stated, "I cannot stress enough the profound humanitarian consequences that political unrest, violence and impunity carry for the population." In January the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report stating that Burundian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-not-allowed-to-enter-burundi.php">barred entry</a> [JURIST report] into Burundi to independent rights experts dispatched by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate violations in the nation. Also in January Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-warns-against-increasing-violence-in-burundi.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of increasing violence in Burundi. In December the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution to dispatch experts to investigate human rights violations in Burundi, condemning violence in the country, use of excessive force by officials and restrictions on freedoms. In November the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-adopts-resolution-to-work-to-end-violence-in-burundi.php">unanimously adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution condemning the political violence and killings currently afflicting Burundi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/19/eu/greece-first-turkey-deportations-riddled-abuse">reported</a> [press release] Tuesday that the first round of EU sanctioned deportations from Greece to Turkey on April 4 was "rushed, chaotic, and violated the rights of those deported." The deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was reportedly "riddled with an array of irregularities," including authorities not informing people that they were going to be deported or where they were being taken and not allowing some to take their personal possessions. In addition, HRW claims that there were many who desired to apply for asylum in Greece and were either ignored or uninformed about the process or the reason for their detention and their right to challenge it. HRW stated that the legal basis of confiscating phones and other possessions from people being deported is unclear and because asylum seekers and migrants rely on their phones to keep in touch with family and stay informed, that "such measures appear unnecessary and cruel, as well as a violation of the individuals' personal property rights." Also, Turkish authorities have reportedly not <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-04-19/the-latest-eu-told-to-admit-more-turks-or-migrant-deal-dies">allowed</a> [AP report] visits by rights organizations or the UN to check on those arriving from Greece and that some of those sent away had lost contact with family and friends still in Greece. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. This month several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also, Turkey's treatment of human rights have been a cause for concern due to the growing partnership with the EU caused by the refugee crisis. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments. In addition, last month, an independent UN human rights expert encouraged EU leaders to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">remain steadfast</a> [JURIST report] in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU and to avoid making Turkey the "gatekeeper"</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1175_hgcj.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-2 Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/franchise-tax-board-of-california-v-hyatt/">Franchise Tax Board v. Hyatt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Nevada may not apply a state law that would allow damages against California that are greater than damages that can be awarded against Nevada in similar circumstances. The court held that Nevada cannot refuse to extend to other states haled into Nevada courts the same immunities Nevada enjoys without violating the constitutional <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art4frag1_user.html">Full Faith and Credit Clause</a> [text]. In a separate issue, the court evenly split over the issue of whether <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1978/77-1337">Nevada v. Hall</a> [materials] should be overruled, which means the lower court's decision will remain in place. That case held that one state can allow a citizen to bring a private lawsuit against another state without that state's consent&#8212;Nevada and California respectively here. Before this appeal, the <a href="http://nvcourts.gov/supreme/">Supreme Court of Nevada</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NV-SCt-Op.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Nevada's exercise of jurisdiction over California was permitted. The case at hand arose when Hyatt allegedly moved from California to Nevada in 1991, but the California Franchise Tax Board claims he moved in 1992 and owes taxes to the state of California. Hyatt filed suit against California in a Nevada state court, seeking damages for the alleged abusive audit.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jurisdiction-of-indian-tribal-courts.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-1175_08l1.pdf">transcript</a>, PDF] in this case in March. <em>Certiorari</em> was <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-union-subsidies-state-sovereignty.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/19/russia-constitutional-court-backs-selective-justice">reported</a> [press release] Tuesday that Russia's Constitutional Court has rejected a binding decision of an international human rights body as "non-executable." The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-122260">ruled</a> [judgment] in 2013 that Russia must reform an absolute ban on voting rights for prisoners. The ECHR had decided that Russia's absolute ban on prisoners voting pursuant to Article 32 § 3 of that country's constitution was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Russian Constitutional Court <a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2016/04/19/russia-s-constitutional-court-permits-non-fulfillment-of-a-european-court-of-human-rights-ruling-for-the-first-time">said</a> [Meduza report] that the ECHR has no right to demand changes to the Russian constitution and that the earlier ruling by the ECHR may be "partially" <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20160419/275893952.html">satisfied</a> [RAPSI report] in Russia. The court stated that the ECHR ruling could be satisfied in terms of "general actions aimed to ensure justice, proportionality and differentiation in restriction of inmates' voting rights" and that the legislature could "change certain regimes of confinement [and through] alternative punishment which does not lead to restriction of voting rights". However, the court rejected the ECHR ruling demanding voting rights be returned to the Russian nationals that served as the parties involved in the earlier ECHR case that serves as the origin of the current controversy. Russia <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/10/dispatches-russian-court-hopes-thwart-international-law-rulings">passed</a> [HRW dispatch] a law in 2015 that permits the Constitutional Court to reject rulings of international human rights bodies if the court find that the ruling contradicts the Russian Constitution. </p>

<p>The ECHR issued a similar ruling in 2014, finding that the UK's ban on prisoners voting <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/europe-rights-court-rules-uk-ban-on-prisoner-voting-violates-human-rights.php">violated their human rights</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2013 the Supreme Court of the UK had <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/uk-top-court-rejects-prisoner-voting-rights.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the law that banned inmates from voting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Several human rights organizations, including <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] on Monday urged the Gambian government to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/04/18/gambia-investigate-death-custody-free-protesters">investigate the death of Solo Sandeng</a> [HRW report], a Gambian human rights activist, who <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/gambian-activist-dies-while-in-detention.php">died</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday while in detention for protesting. Calling his death "suspicious" as there have been reports that he was tortured, the rights organizations have asked the Gambian government to "ensure an independent and impartial investigation into Sandeng's death."  The organizations have also asked for the release of peaceful protestors and a journalist, Alhagie Ceesay, as well as an investigation into the arrests of United Democratic Party party leaders and members such as Ousainu Darboe. Two other party members who were arrested last week have also died in custody under suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>The treatment of activists has been a constant human rights issue throughout the world. Last month Azeri human rights lawyer and advocate <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/azerbaijan-releases-human-rights-activist-from-jail.php">Intigam Aliyev was freed from jail</a> [JURIST report]. Aliyev had been charged with tax evasion, abuse of office and illegal entrepreneurship. Also in March Kuwait's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kuwait-top-court-upholds-4-year-sentence-for-insulting-judges-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the four-year jail sentence against an activist found guilty of insulting judges on Twitter. In February HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-criticizes-oman-for-jailing-social-media-activists.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Omani courts for jailing two online activists over posts they wrote on social media websites. Also in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern </a>[JURIST report] over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. The commissioner stated that civil society workers should be protected by the state, not harassed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN human rights expert on Tuesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19836&LangID=E">called on</a> [statement] the government of Georgia to address the reasons why children in the country are placed under protective care. UN Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Children/Pages/MaudBoerBuquicchio.aspx">Maud de Boer-Buquicchio</a> [official profile] praised the use of temporary shelters but said that the country must consider long-term solutions to children living on the street. Additionally, she <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19840&LangID=E">stated</a> [press release] that Georgia's adoption and foster care laws should be updated to better protect children, as Georgia is one of only a handful of countries that allows international commercial surrogacy arrangements to foreign parents with no regulations to protect the best interests of the child. Boer-Buquicchio did express hopefulness for a better outcome, stating:<blockquote>Solutions to these problems must be found in consultation with children and young people. Despite the difficulties they encounter, the children I met during my visit are full of hope for their future and want to get involved in decisions affecting their lives. As a youth representative told me, 'We are the force that can change things, otherwise there will be a lost generation'!</blockquote>Her comments came at the end of an eight-day visit to Georgia during which she met with high-level government officials, local authorities and children themselves.</p>

<p>The international community has been monitoring the rights of the child since the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text] entered into force in 1990. Earlier this week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-chief-urges-commitment-to-end-torture-of-children.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] about child torture and urged a commitment to end it. Last month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-failure-to-appoint-counsel-to-represent-migrant-children-violates-international-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the filing of an amicus brief in a US federal court arguing that the failure of US government officials to appoint lawyers to represent migrant children facing deportation violates their basic rights under international law. In July 2012 a UN committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-israel-treatment-of-child-detainees.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Israel's treatment of child detainees. In November 2008 the US <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-admits-more-juveniles-held-at.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] to the committee that it was detaining 12 juveniles in Guantanamo. This realization came only months after the committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-tribunals-wrong-venue-for.php">asserted</a> [JURIST report] that military tribunals were not the proper venue for juvenile detainees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN expert <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IntOrder/Pages/AlfredDeZayas.aspx">Alfred de Zayas</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19839&LangID=E">warned against</a> [press release] investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms in trade agreements, saying that they "are incompatible with democracy, the rule of law and human rights." ISDS mechanisms, which according to Zayas, provide for "privatized or semi-privatized dispute settlement" he warns, work against the  public interest and allows calculated risks for profit in accordance with a "ideologically-driven corporate narrative." He believes that the "Investment Court" proposed in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/representatives-from-twelve-countries-sign-trans-pacific-partnership.php">signed in New Zealand</a> [JURIST report] in February, is simply a "zombie of ISDS" with many "fundamental flaws." He concluded his remarks urging the abolishment of ISDS and similar mechanisms. Currently 28 nations are negotiating the TPP.</p>

<p>The development of the TPP has had an impact on US trade laws in the last year, though not without controversy. In February de Zayas <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-expert-urges-countries-not-to-sign-pacific-trade-deal-without-reaffirming-rights-committments.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] governments in the Pacific Rim not to sign the TPP without first "reaffirming ... human rights treaty obligations and their recent pledges to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals." However, two days later 12 countries across the Pacific-Rim signed the TPP in New Zealand amid waves of protest. In June the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-house-passes-compromise-trade-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 286-138 to approve a trade law that provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs to international trade and renews Obama's authority to negotiate trade deals on behalf of the country. The Trade Preference Extension Act included measures Obama had long pushed for and was seen as clearing the way for him to complete negotiations on the TPP. Also in June South Korea and China <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/china-and-south-korea-sign-free-trade-agreement.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bilateral free trade agreement that will eliminate most tariffs between the two countries, which are not party to the TPP, over the next two decades after about three years of negotiations. In July 2014 the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/eu-court-rules-commission-planning-transatlantic-trade-agreement-is-not-transparent-enough.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the European Commission was not being sufficiently transparent regarding negotiations with the US on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which, like the TPP, aims to remove trade barriers between the EU and US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN rights expert on Tuesday released a <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19842&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [statement] over the state of media independence and the public right of access to information in Japan, citing laws and personal stories that are making these more difficult than <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19843&LangID=E">recommended</a> [press release]. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/DavidKaye.aspx">David Kaye</a> [official profile], the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, spent a week in Japan conducting interviews with various government officials as well as members of the media, non-governmental agencies and lawyers in attempt to examine aspects of the freedom of expression under international human rights law. Kaye noted the "well-earned pride" that Japan holds for its constitution and democratic system, yet he found many threats to mainstream media where most get their information. These threats are reportedly leading to developments that hinder the freedom of the press and expression as promised by Japan's <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html">constitution</a> [text] and the <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], which Japan ratified in 1979. Kaye stated:<blockquote>Numerous journalists, many agreeing to meet with me only on condition of anonymity to protect their livelihoods, highlighted the pressure to avoid sensitive areas of public interest. Many claimed to have been sidelined or silenced following indirect pressure from leading politicians. A country with such strong democratic foundations should resist and protect against such interference.</blockquote>He highlighted many areas that could use improvement, including eliminating portions of laws that create indirect threats to the media, implementing laws preventing discrimination and hate speech, and permitting public demonstrations.</p>

<p>Japan is not the only country dealing with these issues, however. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over its many human rights infringements and free speech violations. Earlier this month three UN human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19804&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Egypt to cease its ongoing crackdown on humans rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">defenders and organizations</a> [JURIST report]. In March Egyptian Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/egypt-justice-minister-removed-following-prophet-mohammed-comment.php">relieved of his position</a> [JURIST report] after making controversial statements on television. After being asked a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists, al-Zind responded that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed. Turkey has also been accused of violating human rights freedoms on numerous recent occasions. In March two Turkish journalists went on trial in <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/turkish-court-begins-closed-espionage-trial-of-two-journalists.php">closed proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on espionage charges that have garnered worldwide concerns regarding the state of free press under <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/">President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's</a> [official profile] regime. In December the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/europe-rights-court-turkish-youtube-ban-violated-freedom-of-expression.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that a Turkish court order blocking access to YouTube violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/152206p.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a settlement agreement concerning the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/">National Football League</a> (NFL) [official website] and payouts to retired players with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/sports/football/nfl-concussion-lawsuit.html?_r=0">certain medical conditions</a> [NYT report]. The settlement, originally a $765 million agreement, was changed due to worries of not surviving the settlement term of 65 years. As it was determined in preliminary agreement and then <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2039302/n-f-l-concussion-settlement-ruling.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] to be fair and reasonable by the <a href="http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], the settlement now stands structurally similar to the original but provides for more security of payments to deserving parties.<blockquote>The Settlement has three primary components. An uncapped Monetary Award Fund ("MAF"), overseen by a Claims Administrator, provides compensation for Retired Players who submit sufficient proof of Qualifying Diagnoses. A $75 million Baseline Assessment Program ("BAP&") provides eligible Retired Players with free baseline assessment examinations of their objective neurological functioning. BAP funds will also be used to provide BAP Supplemental Benefits, including counseling and prescription drug benefits, to those who are impaired but have not deteriorated to the point of receiving a Qualifying Diagnosis. Third, an Education Fund will educate Class Members regarding the NFL Parties' existing <a href="https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/collective-bargaining-agreement-2011-2020.pdf">CBA</a> [text, PDF] Medical and Disability Benefits programs, and promote safety and injury prevention for football players of all ages, including youth football players.</blockquote>The Third Circuit acknowledged the good intentions of the limited number of objectors to the settlement agreement, but stated that with it providing nearly $1 billion in value to the designated class of people, which handles any diagnosis or absence thereof prior to the preliminary agreement date of July 7, 2014, "Though not perfect, it is fair."</p>

<p>The settlement caps a rocky period for the NFL, culminating in a recent acknowledgment of the connection between football and degenerative <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/sports/football/nfl-official-affirms-link-with-cte.html?_r=0">brain disorders</a> [NYT report]. In December JURIST Guest Columnist Alyssa Lebron of <a href="http://www.stjohns.edu/law">St. John's University School of Law</a> [official website] Class of 2016 discussed the long-term effects of concussions and the need for federal regulation in <a href="/dateline/2015/12/alyssa-lebron-nfl-concussions.php">contact sports</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In similar fashion and in the same month, JURIST Guest Columnist Carrie Clodi of <a href="http://www.valpo.edu/law/">Valparaiso University School of Law</a> [official website] Class of 2017 discussed legislation regulating youth and student athlete sport participation after concussion or head injury and the necessity of continued awareness of <a href="/dateline/2015/12/carrie-clodi-youth-concussions.php">student athlete safety</a> [JURIST report]. As these articles point out, the developments in research concerning these sports-related health issues are creating a large focus on how to prevent the causes moving forward and how to treat the effects of past action that were not previously recognized.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-19-16.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in two cases Tuesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-420_3ea4.pdf">US v. Bryant</a> [transcript, PDF] the court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-bryant/">heard arguments</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to determine whether a conviction in an Indian tribal court without counsel used to satisfy the predicate offense requirement of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/117">18 USC § 117</a> [text], which criminalizes domestic assault when the defendant has at least two convictions in a federal, state or Indian tribal court, violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/overview">Sixth Amendment</a> [Cornell LLI materials]. The case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-420">arose</a> [Oyez summary] after Michael Bryant, Jr. was convicted on two counts of domestic abuse under § 117 where the two predicate offenses were his convictions in Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. Bryant moved for dismissal, claiming that the convictions violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because they were without counsel. The district court denied the motion, but the <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] reversed.</p>

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-7_6537.pdf">United Health Services v. Escobar</a> [transcript, PDF] to determine <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/universal-health-services-v-united-states-ex-rel-escobar/">whether</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] the "implied certification test" under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3729">False Claims Act</a> [text] is valid and if so does the relevant statute have to explicitly state the conditions of payment that the defendant allegedly failed to meet. The case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-7">arose</a> [Oyez summary] when a young girl, Yarushka Rivera, visited Arbour Counseling Services, a counseling center for mental illnesses run by United Health Services (UHS). After receiving a diagnosis and being prescribed medicine for bipolar disorder from unlicensed practitioners, Yarushka died. The parents filed complaints state agencies and then sued UHS under both the federal and state False Claims Acts. The district court held that they did not sufficiently plead the elements of falsity that claims under the False Claims Act require. The court of appeals reversed and held that they did.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of federal judges on Monday <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article72552187.ece/BINARY/Order%20in%20Brown's%20case.pdf">rejected a motion</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="https://corrinebrown.house.gov/">Representative Corrine Brown</a> [official profile] challenging the current congressional district boundaries in Florida. Brown has long argued that the current boundary system <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/court-rejects-bid-throw-florida-congressional-map-38494792">violates federal voting laws</a> [AP report] by diminishing the rights of minorities. Brown also argued that her district now includes a dozen prisons, which alters the true number of eligible voters within the district. However, after examining the matter, the panel of judges found that Brown had not produced any evidence to prove her case. The current congressional districts were approved by the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] in December. Any appeal by Brown would go directly to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last month the Supreme Court The <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. This district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In November the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-three-judge-rule-for-redistricting-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a challenge to the Three Judge Court Act, which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. In June the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. Last April the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/152056.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in favor of a transgender Virginia high school student who sued his school for discrimination. Gavin Grimm, 16, of Gloucester County, Virginia, sued his school for not allowing him to use the boys bathroom. The school had <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/19/474853355/federal-court-sides-with-transgender-teen-in-virginia-bathroom-case">decided on a policy</a> [NPR report] that boys and girls bathrooms were to be used only by students of "corresponding biological genders." The school later provided a unisex bathroom for Grimm to use. Grimm argued before the court that the school violated <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/overview-title-ix-education-amendments-1972-20-usc-1681-et-seq">Title IX of the Educational Amendments Act of 1972</a> [materials], which prohibits discrimination based on sex in any federally funded educational program. The <a href="http://www.ed.gov/">Department of Education</a> [official website] had issued a memo in 2015 stating that schools must treat transgender students consistently with their gender identities. In a <a href="https://acluva.org/18447/federal-court-of-appeals-rules-in-favor-of-transgender-student-in-virginia-restroom-access-case/">statement</a> [press release], Grimm stated, "I feel so relieved and vindicated by the court's ruling. .. Today's decision gives me hope that my fight will help other kids avoid discriminatory treatment at school."</p>

<p>Tuesday's ruling could have potential ramifications for a recently passed <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">North Carolina law</a> [JURIST report], as North Carolina is also in the Fourth Circuit.. Under the new law, cities and counties would be unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. It also requires public school students to use the school bathroom or locker room that corresponds tot their sex at birth. Rights groups have already <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a legal challenge</a>, but Attorney General Roy Cooper stated he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">not defend the law in court</a> [JURIST reports]. Last week North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory issued an executive order that he said was meant to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">clarify the controversial law</a> [JURIST report]. In a statement on the order, the governor said that the mandate of gender-specific restrooms and locker rooms in government buildings and schools would be maintained but that he would also seek legislation in a short session to reinstate the right to sue for discrimination in state court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-614_k5fm.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Tuesday that state plans by Maryland and New Jersey impeded upon the <a href="http://www.ferc.gov/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's</a> (FERC) [official website] authority under the <a href="http://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Federal%20Power%20Act.pdf">Federal Power Act</a> [text, PDF]. The states were subsidizing their in-state energy companies to build new electricity capacity in return for the option for those companies to market the energy through auctions. The court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/opinion-analysis-u-s-energy-regulators-authority-grows/">found</a> [SCOTUSBlog report] that the effect of these auctions caused the regional prices of electricity in the Atlantic market to fall below what the FERC had concluded was necessary to assure the continued supply of adequate generation. The court consolidated <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/nazarian-v-ppl-energyplus-llc/">Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/cpv-maryland-llc-v-ppl-energyplus-llc/">CPV Maryland, LLC v. Talen Energy Marketing</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-fixed-rate-contracts-with-energy-provider.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the matter in February.</p>

<p>Collectively, recent federal legislation and technological innovation reduced barriers to entry in the electricity supply market leading to <a href="http://tlp.law.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/tlp/article/view/168">new developments such as demand response</a> [JTLP student note], which triggered new legal challenges over the jurisdictional divide between the federal government and the states in US power markets. In January the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-for-energy-commission-over-wholesale-demand-response.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of the FERC over wholesale demand response. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments.php">heard oral argument</a> [JURIST report] in FERC v. EPSA on October 14. On behalf of FERC, the Solicitor General argued that Order 745 is a strong example of cooperative federalism, and the policy brings about billions of dollars in consumer benefits by <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/10/argument-analysis-when-an-empty-chair-may-count-the-most/">lowering wholesale rates</a> [SCOTUSblog op-ed]. The <a href="https://www.epsa.org/forms/documents/DocumentFormPublic/">Electric Power Supply Association</a> (EPSA) [official website] argued that Order 745 lures retail electricity consumers to participate in the wholesale market, which is prohibited by the FPA. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-pair-of-cases-involving-federal-energy-regulation.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> in this case</a> [JURIST report] and consolidated the dispute with another challenge from the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/enernoc-inc-v-electric-power-supply-association/">EPSA, EnerNOC, Inc. v. EPSA</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], in May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Hague District Court on Wednesday <a href="http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2016:4229">overturned</a> [judgment, in Dutch] a 2014 <a href="http://archive.pca-cpa.org/Final%20Award%20-%2018%20July%202014%20-%20Yukos%20Universal%20Limited%20v.%20Russian%20Federationf230.pdf?fil_id=2723">order</a> [text, PDF] from the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> (PCA) [official website] that Russia pay USD $50 billion to former shareholders of the <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/19/whats-really-happening-with-the-yukos-case-russia-putin-belgium-france/">Yukos oil company</a> [Foreign Policy report]. The previous award handed down by the PCA was the largest award handed down to compensate for unfair tax proceedings by Yukos. The Dutch district court claimed in its decision that the PCA did not have jurisdiction to hear and oversee the issue. At this time former shareholders have stated that they wish to appeal the recent decision overturning the order against Yukos. </p>

<p>Last December Russia's Investigative Committee <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/russia-officials-charge-khodorkovsky-with-murder.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former Yukos oil tycoon <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=khodorkovsky&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [JURIST news archive] with multiple murders and attempted murders during the 1990s according to the Interfax agency.  In 2014 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the tax claim keeping Khodorkovsky in exile and released his business partner <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [JURIST news archive]. Lebedev's release came four months early, with the remainder of his sentence considered time served. Khodorkovsky was released from prison <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/khodorkovsky-pardoned-by-putin-released-from-jail.php">following a pardon</a> [JURIST report] in 2013 from Russian President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin&page=2">news archive</a>]. Despite the pardon, he remains liable for 17.5 billion rubles ($514 million) in tax claims against his company, Yukos Oil Co.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [official website] on Tuesday released an <a href="http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/BR%2015-99%20Opinion%20and%20Order.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] allowing the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] to collect telephone records under the new intelligence law passed by congress last year. The order was formally issued on December 21 and only came to light when it was posted by the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a> [official website]. The order signed by FISC Chief Judge Thomas Hoganheld that the surveillance measures sent to the court were in compliance with the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-senate-votes-to-reduce-governments-mass-surveillance-powers.php">USA Freedom Act</a> [JURIST report], signed into law last year. The surveillance application has been noted not to target specific records or data without specific justification. </p>

<p>The passage of the USA Freedom Act was driven largely by efforts to reform the NSA that came after former NSA contractor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=edward+snowden">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST archive] leaked information about the bulk collection of phone records in 2013. In November a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-part-of-nsa-phone-surveillance-program.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] part of the NSA's surveillance program that collected domestic phone records in bulk. Judge Richard Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia said that the program was most likely unconstitutional and shut down the program just weeks before the NSA was scheduled to scrap it and replace it. In his opinion, Leon stated that the constitutional issues related to the program were "too important" to leave unanswered after questions regarding the program arose after its inception soon after September 11, 2001.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Apple agreed on Tuesday to pay $24.9 million to <a href="http://www.marathonpg.com/patent-portfolio/subsidiary-listing/detail/546/dynamic-advances">Dynamic Advances and parent company Marathon Patent Group</a> [corporate website] to settle a <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/new-york/nyndce/1:2012cv01579/91797/1/0.pdf?ts=1376974773">2012 patent lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] concerning Apple's voice-controlled interface, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Siri</a> [corporate website]. Four years before Siri was released to the public, the New York <a href="http://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US7177798">patent</a> [text] with Dynamic Advances for a "natural language interface using [a] constrained intermediate dictionary of results". Apple <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/news/2016/04/19/apple-settles-siri-lawsuit-with-rensselaer-dallas.html?page=all">avoided trial</a> [Albany Business Review report] by agreeing to settle a month before the scheduled hearing date. Under the new agreement, Apple will be free of related lawsuits for three years and will be allowed to continue using Siri in commercial devices. Apple will pay $5 million to Marathon Patent Group upon dropping the case, and the remaining sum will be paid to Dynamic Advances. Though Rensselaer is expected to receive half of Dynamic Advances' settlement amount, the institute has not yet agreed to the payment and may choose to settle the matter in arbitration. </p>

<p>Apple has been found in violation of numerous technology patents including <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/german-court-rules-against-apple-for-violating-streaming-patent.php">several video streaming patents</a> [JURIST report] belonging to the <a href="https://www.nagra.com/">Kudeleski Group</a> [official website], a Swiss security company. Last month the <a href="http://www.lg-duesseldorf.nrw.de/behoerde/index.php">Dusseldorf District Court</a> [official website] found that numerous Apple products violated Kudeleski patents and imposed a fine of €250,000 per violation. Though it is uncertain if Apple will be able to invalidate the patents in court, the company must still address a related patent lawsuit pending in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-770_9o6b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-2 Wednesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-markazi-v-peterson/">Bank Markazi v Peterson</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the enactment of a statute allowing terrorism victims' families to collect seized Iranian assets does not violate separation of powers, even if it directs a particular result in a single pending case. The US Congress enacted the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title22-section8722&num=0&edition=prelim">Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012</a> [22 USC &#167; 8722] to place beyond dispute the availability of certain assets for satisfaction of judgments rendered in terrorism cases against Iran. The act allows a designated set of assets available to satisfy the judgments underlying an enforcement proceeding which the statute identifies by the district court's docket number: "the financial assets that are identified in and the subject of proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran ... shall be subject to execution ... in order to satisfy any judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages awarded against Iran for damages for personal injury or death caused by an act of [terrorism]." In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the court <a href="http://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/13-2952/13-2952-2014-07-09.pdf?ts=1410919507">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] and held that &#167;8722 does not violate the separation of powers. The court reasoned that Congress may require a court to apply a new legal standard in a pending prejudgment enforcement proceeding, and the statue was an appropriate exercise of Congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. </p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-iran-terrorism-compensation-case.php">heard oral argument</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-770_m64o.pdf">transcript, PDF</a>] in <u>Bank Markazi</u> in January. The respondents are more than 1,000 individuals that brought suit against Iran for actions related to state sponsored terrorism. To enforce their claims under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">28 USC &#167;1605A</a> [text], the statute that allows American nationals to seek money damages from state sponsors of terrorism in the courts of the US, petitioners moved for a turnover in 2008 of about $1.75 billion in bond assets held in a New York bank account by the Bank Markazi. The Petitioner Bank Markazi, a/k/a the Central Bank of Iran, argued that &#167;8722 allowed Congress to usurp judicial authority which violates separation of powers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has begun criminal investigations into US citizens connected to  tax avoidance claims arising from the <a href="https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs/">Panama Papers</a> [official website], media reported Tuesday. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/meet-us-attorney">Preet Bharara</a> [official profile], well known for his prosecutions against financial fraud, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/19/panama-papers-us-justice-department-investigation-tax-avoidance">sent a letter</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] requesting the cooperation of the <a href="https://www.icij.org/">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> (ICIJ) [official website], the group responsible for coordinating the major leak. Bharara has already begun investigating some of the 200 or more US citizens mentioned in the Panama Papers. This development follows recent comments from President Barrack Obama, who expressed his concerns regarding the economic impact of global tax evasion and the difficulty of prosecuting the harmful conduct. </p>

<p>World leaders and other high profile individuals are hiding billions in off-shore accounts, according to reports that cite confidential documents <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/leaked-panama-law-firm-documents-reveal-high-profile-individuals-hiding-assets-reports.php">leaked</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.mossfon.com/">Mossack Fonseca</a> [official website], an international law firm in Panama. The documents, coined the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers">"Panama Papers"</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder] by the ICIJ, purportedly show that numerous politicians, celebrities and other wealthy individuals have hid money utilizing the legal services of Mossack Fonseca. The Panama Papers include 11 million documents allegedly illustrating how the firm laundered money and helped their wealthy clients avoid tax consequences and dodge sanctions. It is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844">reported</a> [BBC report] that 12 heads of state are among those implicated by the Panama Papers. Mossack Fonseca has denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were the victim of a data breach and that they have not engaged in any illegal activity. Earlier this month Panamanian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/panama-prosecutor-investigating-law-firm-mossack-fonseca.php">raided</a> [JURIST report] the firm seeking evidence of money laundering and financing terrorism related to the leak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Leyton, a prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/health/flint-water-crisis-charges/index.html">announced Wednesday</a> [CNN report] that a Michigan judge will allow criminal charges against three people involved in the water crisis in Flint, including the man who supervised the treatment plan as well as two state environmental officials. In another development a federal court on Monday <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/federal-judge-dismisses-flint-residents-150-million-class/story?id=38514144">dismissed</a> [ABC News report] a class action <a href="http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mays-vs.-Snyder-et-al.-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-Final-1.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF] from citizens of Flint, Michigan regarding the water crisis the city has been facing. <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/index.cfm?pageFunction=chambers&judgeid=16">Judge John Corbett O'Meara</a> [official profile] of the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] determined that his court did not have jurisdiction because the claim was not made under the federal <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> [EPA information] and that the plaintiffs should take their claim to a state court. However, the plaintiffs brought their claim under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">14th Amendment</a>'s [text] Due Process Clause in attempts to cover the federal jurisdiction and because the relief sought included monetary damages, which the Safe Drinking Water Act does not allow. This procedural dismissal is a setback for the citizens seeking compensation for themselves and the city as a whole, but it does not prevent further action.</p>

<p>Public officials have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/what-did-the-governor-know-about-flints-water-and-when-did-he-know-it/423342/">come under fire</a> [<em>Atlantic</em> report] for their response to the crisis, as it took 20 months after the initial switch in water supply for an emergency to be declared by the state. Earlier this month the city of Flint filed an <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/city-of-flint-files-intent-to-sue-letter-with-state-no-suit-yet.php">intent to sue letter</a> [JURIST report] with the state, claiming that the city lacks funds to defend itself against lawsuits filed during the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/health/flint-water-crisis-timeline/">water crisis</a> [CNN timeline]. In March a Michigan firm filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-flint-children-exposed-to-water.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the children of Flint. Earlier in March seven families living in Flint filed a <a href="https://dlbjbjzgnk95t.cloudfront.net/0768000/768552/flint%20suit.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Governor Rick Snyder alleging <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">gross negligence</a> [JURIST report] in connection to the lead-contaminated water. Also in March a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-experts-urge-us-to-address-michigan-water-contamination.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its efforts to address the issue of lead-contaminated water in Flint. In January the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-lead-pipes-in-flint-michigan.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking the replacement of lead water pipes in the city of Flint. The lawsuit, filed in conjunction with Concerned Pastors for Social Action, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Flint resident Melissa Mays, seeks to force city and state officials to mediate alleged violations of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Also in January Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/michigan-ag-appoints-former-prosecutor-to-investigate-flint-water-crisis.php">appointed a former prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] to act as Special Counsel in his investigation into the water contamination crisis in the city of Flint, and a retired Detroit FBI chief will also participate in the investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official website] on Tuesday approved a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/833701/download">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] between the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and the city of <a href="https://www.fergusoncity.com">Ferguson, Missouri</a> [official website]. The suit had been filed by the DOJ against the city for alleged police injustice by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag">US Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] and had claimed that actions by Ferguson police officers had violated the federal constitution and national civil rights laws. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-head-civil-rights-division-vanita-gupta-regarding-district-court-s-approval-consent">said</a> [press release] Tuesday that "the department is looking forward to working with the city of Ferguson as it implements the decree and continues the essential work to create a police department that the Constitution requires and that residents deserve."</p>

<p>The settlement was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ferguson-doj-file-settlement.php">submitted to the judge</a> earlier in March after Lynch had <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-civil-rights-lawsuit-against-ferguson.php">first announced the lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] alleging unjust policing in February. Included in the lawsuit were allegations that the police department and municipal court interfere with citizens' First Amendment right to free expression, prosecute and resolve municipal charges in a manner which violates due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and engage in discriminatory law enforcement conduct against African Americans in violation of both the Fourteenth Amendment and federal law. Ferguson gained international attention after the 2014 shooting of <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/ferguson-shooting-evidence-released-following-grand-jury-decision.php">Michael Brown and the subsequent trial</a> [JURIST report]. The response to the shooting set off massive protests and social unrest that cost millions of dollars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court rules on sentencing guidelines</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] voted 8-0 to <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-8913_5h25.pdf">reverse and remand</a> [opinion, PDF] the case of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/molina-martinez-v-united-states/">Molina-Martinez v. US</a> [SCOTUSblog docket] on the issue of whether courts reviewing sentencing guideline errors may apply a categorical "additional evidence" rule where a district court applies an incorrect range but sentences the defendant within the correct range. The court rejected the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13-40324.0.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] that held the petitioner's substantial rights were not violated when he was originally sentenced under an incorrect range based on his criminal history but the sentence ultimately fell within the correct guidelines. The Fifth Circuit ruled that Molina-Martinez could not meet the standard under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_52">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b)</a> [text] that his substantial rights were violated. The Fifth Circuit held that Molina-Martinez failed to identify "additional evidence" to prove that the use of the incorrect sentencing guidelines range would have altered his sentence, and an incorrect sentencing guidelines range does not by itself establish additional evidence. The case arose when petitioner Saul Molina-Martinez pleaded guilty to being unlawfully present in the US after being deported following an aggravated felony conviction. The guidelines range in his pre-sentence report was 77-96 months. The district court sentenced him to 77 months in prison. On appeal, Molina-Martinez argued that his probation officer calculated his criminal history points incorrectly and placed him in the wrong sentencing guideline range. Consequently, Molina-Martinez argued that his sentencing guidelines range should have been 70-87 months. In Wednesday's opinion, the court stated that going forward a defendant can rely on the application of an incorrect guidelines range to show an effect on his substantial rights on appeal, but the government will not have to prove that every guidelines error was harmless. </p>

<p>The Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-habeas-relief-sentencing-guidelines.php">heard oral argument</a> [JURIST report; transcript, PDF] in <u>Molina-Martinez v. US</u> in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager_en">Margrethe Vestagar</a> [official profile], the Commissioner of Competition for the EU, on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-1506_en.htm">opened a probe</a> [press release] into the international business practices of Google concerning the tech giant's relationship with other Android developers. Vestagar <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager/announcements/competition-mother-invention_en">stated</a> [speech] that Google's practice of requiring mobile phone producers to pre-load Google applications on new devices could hinder innovation and might violate international <a href="/feature/featured/antitrust/detail.php">antitrust</a> [JURIST backgrounder] law. Google has allegedly violated antitrust law by mandating that phone developers choose entirely-Google products over other competing options if the developer desires to use one of Google's apps.  </p>

<p>Google has faced numerous legal suits both in the US and internationally. In 2015 the <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/google-rejects-eu-antitrust-claim-refuses-to-change-search-results.php">EU filed an antitrust claim</a> [JURIST report] against Google claiming that Google structures its search results to favor its own services over those of rivals. Earlier that year, privacy software company <a href="https://disconnect.me">Disconnect</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/privacy-software-company-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-google.php">filed antitrust charges</a> [JURIST report] against Google with the European Commissioner. That January a representative for Google <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/google-to-rewrite-privacy-policy-in-response-to-uk-pressure.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to rewrite the company's current privacy policy in response to pressure from the <a href="https://ico.org.uk">UK Information Commissioner's Office</a> [official website]. Also in January of last year Google was among four tech companies that reached a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/apple-google-settle-415-million-class-action-lawsuit.php">$415 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit claiming the companies unlawfully agreed to reduce employee compensation and mobility. A <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/china-executive-permitted-to-sue-google-over-autocomplete.php">Hong Kong court ruled</a> [JURIST report] in August 2014 that Chinese businessman Dr. Albert Yeung Sau Shing may continue his defamation suit against Google over the autocomplete function of the company's search engine, which suggests links connecting Yeung to organized crime groups in China. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-oracle-in-dispute-with-google.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May 2014 that programming interfaces in Oracle's Java technology can be protected under US copyright law, allowing Oracle to pursue its legal case against Google.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <US a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday unanimously <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-232_ihdj.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state. The claim from Republicans in the state was that the reapportionment of votes resulted in a discriminatory distribution favoring the Democratic Party. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the unanimous decision, "as the district court concluded, the deviations predominantly reflected Commission efforts to achieve compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act, not to secure political advantage for one party." However, the one-person, one-vote principle "does not demand mathematical perfection." The court unanimously held that because of the low percentage differences from district to district, the drawings were constitutional.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Also this week a panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article72552187.ece/BINARY/Order%20in%20Brown's%20case.pdf">rejected a motion</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="https://corrinebrown.house.gov/">Representative Corrine Brown</a> [official profile] challenging the current congressional <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">district boundaries in Florida</a> [JURIST report]. Last month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. This district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In November the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-three-judge-rule-for-redistricting-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a challenge to the Three Judge Court Act, which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. In June the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. Last April the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-20-16.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in two cases Wednesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-1468_b97d.pdf">Birchfield v. North Dakota</a> [transcript, PDF] the court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/birchfield-v-north-dakota/">heard arguments</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] on whether a state can criminalize a refusal to submit to a warrantless chemical test regarding blood alcohol content. This case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/14-1468">arose</a> [Oyez summary] when Birchfield was arrested for drunk driving after failing a breathalizer test but refused to allow a blood test. He was criminally charged for this refusal under a <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t39c08.pdf?20160420140144">North Dakota law</a> [text, PDF], and sentenced to 30 days in jail. He appealed his case to the North Dakota Supreme Court, which <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/State-v.-Birchfield-2015-ND-6-858-N.W.2d-302.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] his criminal judgment.</p>

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-415_5i26.pdf">Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro</a> [transcript, PDF] to determine <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/encino-motorcars-llc-v-navarro/">whether</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] service advisors at car dealerships are entitled to the overtime pay requirements in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-8">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [text]. This case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-415">arose</a> [Oyez summary] when Navarro, a service agent at a Mercedes-Benz car dealership who greeted customers and assessed their needs, sued his employer for failing to provide overtime pay for hours worked past 40 per week. According to the FLSA, service agents are not eligible for overtime pay. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/13-55323.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Navarro could in fact receive overtime payment, reversing the lower court's decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/home.html">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/54e89689-4fdd-40d3-a242-a1acde95504d/6/doc/14-4714_so.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/54e89689-4fdd-40d3-a242-a1acde95504d/6/hilite/">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the convictions of five former employees of Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities firm who were convicted of various fraud charges in 2014. The three-judge panel <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-madoff-idUSL2N17N0Y5">rejected</a> [Reuters report] arguments that the conviction lacked sufficient evidence, and that aspects of the prosecution's closing argument were racially-charged. The ex-employees were found guilty of helping Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison term, conceal a Ponzi scheme that cost investors over $17 billion. These five ex-employees were among 15 who are now serving sentencing in connection with the multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>Legal action has continued from the fallout of the 2008 Madoff Ponzi scheme. In August the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/final-madoff-defendant-sentenced-to-six-months-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Irwin Lipkin, a former controller of Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities, to six months in prison for his involvement in the scheme. In June 2014 a former accountant for Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/former-madoff-accountant-pleads-guilty-for-aiding-in-scheme.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges connected to the Ponzi scheme. In March 2014 a federal jury in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/five-madoff-associates-found-guilty-in-ponzi-scheme.php">returned a guilty verdict</a> [JURIST report] for five former associates of Madoff on charges they aided and profited from the Ponzi scheme. In January 2014 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/jp-morgan-chase-agrees-to-settlement-penalty-in-madoff-case.php">approved a settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and JPMorgan Chase over the bank's failure to report internal suspicions regarding Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In September 2013 a judge for the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/madoff-victims-not-entitled-to-interest-bankruptcy-judge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that victims can only recover the principal amount invested without accounting for inflation over the past five years and excluding interest. In April 2013 a judge for the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-rejects-madoff-victims-suit-against-sec.php">rejected a suit</a> [JURIST report] by victims against the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> gave an address on Wednesday marking the 70th anniversary of the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official websites]. In his <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9635">remarks</a> [transcript], the secretary-general stated that the ICJ has made an "enormous contribution" to international law. The "World Court" was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53733#.Vxju0DArKM8">established</a> [UN News Centre report] by <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/un-charter-full-text/index.html">UN Charter</a> [text] in 1945 with a dual role: first, to make a final settlement of legal disputes between states, and second, to give advice on legal questions to UN agencies and members. The secretary-general discussed the increasing effectiveness and importance of the court, stressing that those States who had not accepted the Court's jurisdiction should do so. ICJ President Ronny Abraham also spoke at the ceremony, stating:<blockquote>[T]he need for a world court working for international peace and justice is as strong today as it was when the [UN] Charter was first signed. The Court's judgements on the merits all represent disputes that have been settled, and situations that might otherwise have led to open conflict and that have found a peaceful outcome.</blockquote>A decade ago, then secretary-general Kofi Annan <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/international-court-of-justice.php">celebrated</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ's 60th anniversary. He spoke highly of the ICJ's increasing ability to settle disputes among the member states and also urged members states "to consider recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court" and encouraged "states that are not yet prepared to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction to consider submitting their disputes to the Court by Special Agreements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] said Thursday that German automaker <a href="http://www.volkswagenag.com/homepage">Volkswagen AG</a> (VW) [corporate website] has <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/crb/vwmdl">reached a settlement</a> [case materials] with the US <a href="https://www3.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website], California officials and consumers over a plan to fix or buy back nearly 600,000 diesel-powered vehicles that were found to have violated US emissions standards. Judge Charles Breyer had given VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-grants-volkswagen-one-month-to-comply-with-us-emission-standards.php">one month to comply</a> [JURIST report] after he was persuaded that VW engineers were working "round the clock" to develop a fix. The agreement includes compensation for consumers who will be able to sell back their vehicles or get repairs, but financial details were not available, as the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/04/21/volkswagen-emissions-hearing/83332794/">deal is still being finalized</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report]. Parties have until June 21 to file preliminary proposals on the settlement, at which point the public will have an opportunity to comment.</p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. A law firm in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/volkswagen-facing-multi-billion-dollar-investor-lawsuit-in-germany.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last month against VW on behalf of investors alleging a breach of duty to the capital market. Last year the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office opened a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/germany-prosecutor-investigating-former-vw-ceo.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, following accusations that the company cheated on government emissions tests by manipulating exhaust valves. The investigation followed several criminal complaints, including one filed by VW, and came less than a week after Winterkorn stepped down as CEO of the company. In his statement he accepted "responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines" and said that he was "clearing the way for this fresh start with [his] resignation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Wednesday charged 40 people with offenses related to recent protests. More than 50 people were arrested after a demonstration last Thursday by members of the opposition United Democratic Party calling for free speech and an electoral forum. There is concern that three of the high ranking members of the party are <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/gambian-activist-dies-while-in-detention.php">dead</a> [JURIST report]. 18 of those charged were <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0XI0M5?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">accused</a> [Reuters report] on five counts: unlawful assembly, rioting, incitement of violence, interfering with vehicles and holding a procession without a permit. The cases will be heard on April 27.</p>

<p>The treatment of activists has been a constant human rights issue throughout the world. Last month Azeri human rights lawyer and advocate <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/azerbaijan-releases-human-rights-activist-from-jail.php">Intigam Aliyev was freed from jail</a> [JURIST report]. Aliyev had been charged with tax evasion, abuse of office and illegal entrepreneurship. Also in March Kuwait's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kuwait-top-court-upholds-4-year-sentence-for-insulting-judges-on-twitter.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the four-year jail sentence against an activist found guilty of insulting judges on Twitter. In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-criticizes-oman-for-jailing-social-media-activists.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Omani courts for jailing two online activists over posts they wrote on social media websites. Also in February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. The commissioner stated that civil society workers should be protected by the state, not harassed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's opposition-led <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">parliament</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/uploads/leyes/2016-03-03/doc_a1f3cc396c1baf852bd2b57677e1c9ad4a0150c6.pdf">approved</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] new referendum rules. The law speeds up the process of requesting recall referendums. The <a href="http://www.venezuelaemb.or.kr/english/ConstitutionoftheBolivarianingles.pdf">Venezuelan Constitution</a> [text, PDF] allows elected officials be recalled if they have served over half their term. This is a move to take control of referendums from the country's elections council. Polls <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN0XH2VY">show</a> [Reuters report] that over two-thirds of Venezuelans believe President Nicholas Maduro's term should end this year. However, until this point the elections council and the Supreme Court have sided with Maduro against parliament. The <a href="http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/4929">Ruling Socialist party</a> [venezuelanalysis.com report] claims that this is a "parliamentary coup" by the opposition after their discussion of a constitutional amendment that would cut the presidential term from six years to four. Maduro's supporters also claim it is illegal for parliament to retroactively change the length of his term. Parliament will now wait to see if the Supreme Court will overturn their new referendum law. </p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December election. Last month the highest court in Venezuela, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, ruled that the Venezuelan national assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review the appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party. The 13 justices were sworn in on December 23, immediately prior to the exit of prior Socialist Party majority. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">upheld President Maduro's economic emergency decree</a> [JURIST report] as legal and valid despite a rejection by the national assembly. The decree allows the president to control the budget, companies and the currency. In January the Supreme Tribunal of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">ruled that all decisions from the opposition-led assembly would be void</a> [JURIST report] until three opposition lawmakers were removed from their seats. The court's decision came days after the assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-swears-in-3-elected-lawmakers-barred-by-supreme-court-ruling.php">swore in elected lawmakers</a> that were temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">barred by the court</a> [JURIST reports]. The ruling had suspended four elected lawmakers for their involvement in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/venezuela-socialist-party-challenges-recent-election-of-opposition-politicians.php">alleged election fraud last December</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/">Virginia's General Assembly</a> [official website] voted Wednesday to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?161+ful+HB815ER2+pdf">proposal</a> [text, PDF] was supported by <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website], who stated that suppliers would only sell their products if their identities remained confidential. Otherwise, due to potential harassment, Virginia may have lost its supply of such drugs and the ability to perform capital punishment. Various religious groups and death penalty opponents <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/virginia-to-shield-identities-of-execution-drug-suppliers/2016/04/20/1dfc2942-0763-11e6-bfed-ef65dff5970d_story.html">argued</a> [WP report] that it is not right for the state to take human life "under the veil of secrecy." McAuliffe, who is against the death penalty, introduced the bill as an <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-governor-amends-alternative-execution-bill.php">alternative</a> [JURIST report] to using the electric chair in capital punishment. The bill was <a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/article_25377abb-93b9-5887-b314-c63adb8b0380.html">initially rejected</a> [Richmond Dispatch report] by the House 47-51, but on a second try the bill passed 59-40. The Senate confirmed the bill 22-16</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The US Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19859&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] on Friday regarding the expanding role which the Thai military is playing in the civilian administration. Thailand will soon vote on a <a href="http://www.parliament.go.th/ewtcommittee/ewt/draftconstitution2/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=304&filename=index">final draft</a> [text, PDF, in Thai] of their constitution, and a new law places limits on advocating for or against the constitution which has led to the arrests of several human rights protestors. Zied is particularly concerned with <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-military-granted-police-powers.php">Order Number 13/2016</a> [JURIST report], a law enacted last month that significantly expands the power of the military to allow them to act as general law enforcement under 27 laws. This proposed final draft of the constitution would also institutionalize the military into policy-making. Zeid stated, "As a matter of priority, I call on the Government to suspend the application of these dangerously sweeping laws and orders that have bestowed more power upon the military."</p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over Thailand's governmental impunity since it became a military junta in May 2014. Earlier this month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and several other rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to repeal Order Number 13/2016, expressing concern that it will worsen human rights conditions. In January Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-thailand-must-fully-investigate-forced-disappearances.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Thai government to fully investigate the whereabouts of at least 82 people listed as disappeared and to criminalize forced disappearance through legislation. That same month, Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/thailands-draft-constitution-unveiled.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] the new draft constitution, which human rights groups stated was aimed at increasing the power of the military under the guise of clauses intended to promote national security, permitting the government to commit human rights abuses without fear of punishment in violation of international treaties. In December Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-torture-allegations-in-koh-tao-murder-case-must-be-investigated.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] a thorough investigation into torture allegations levied against the police responsible for the arrests of two men in relation to the Koh Tao murders. The men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun, were found guilty of the murder of two British tourists in the vacation island of Koh Tao. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Uber reaches settlement with drivers in labor dispute</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.uber.com/?nav=b">Uber</a> [corporate website] <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/310033204/Uber-Settlement">reached a settlement</a> [text] on Thursday with 385,000 of its drivers in Massachusetts and California in a case surrounding the drivers' status as independent contractors. The drivers had filed this class action lawsuit seeking employee status. Under the terms of the settlement, Uber will continue to classify these drivers as independent contractors but must pay $100 million to the drivers and revise its deactivation policy. Drivers can no longer be "deactivated" at will, but can only be terminated for sufficient cause and with previous warnings. The settlement comes only two weeks after the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-allows-uber-to-appeal-approval-of-class-action.php">agreed to hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Uber of the lower court's order that certified the class of drivers to proceed with the class action. The settlement spares the company from undergoing the jury trial that had been scheduled for June.</p>

<p>With the rapid growth of companies like <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a> [corporate website] and Uber, ride-sharing services have been among the <a href="/feature/2015/11/ride-sharing.php">most controversial business models</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent history. App-based ride-sharing services have been both praised for their successful implementation and criticized for their uncertain position in transportation regulation. In several states, ride-sharing companies have met significant legal opposition, frequently led by competitors such as the taxi industry. <a href="/feature/2015/11/future-of-ride-sharing.php">Other unresolved questions</a> [JURIST backgrounder] surrounding this new business model continue to prompt debate among lawmakers. Although some cities and states, such as California, have <a href="http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2015/07/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-californias-new?&slreturn=1461336766">developed new laws</a> [PC360 report] mandating certain insurance for ride-sharing drivers, others have resisted. Officials in Buffalo, for example, find the lack of insurance regulation in this industry <a href="http://www.wkbw.com/news/future-of-ride-sharing-in-buffalo">too unsafe</a> [ABC report], so prohibit ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber from operating inside the city. In fact, Attorney General of New York Eric Schneiderman <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-joint-settlement-lyft">sued</a> [press release] Lyft for operating in violation of local regulations in Rochester and Buffalo, resulting in a $300,000 settlement. Further controversy surrounds the potential threat to taxi-drivers and companies, a threat that has also sparked litigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/appeals-court-opinion-in-drone-case/1962/">upheld</a> [order] a district court's dismissal of a <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [official website] request for information about the US government's use of drones for "targeted killings." The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] sought to obtain legal memoranda on drone use as well as compilations of data on government strikes that can detail who intended targets were, locations of strikes, and how many people have been killed, among other information. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) argued that the documents are exempt from disclosure, and the lower court granted summary judgment in their favor. The appeals court on Thursday agreed with the CIA that the requested documents were properly classified and exempt from FOIA requests because they pertain to intelligence activities and/or foreign activities of the US. The court also agreed with the CIA that there we no "segregable portions" of the documents which could be disclosed. </p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both domestic circles and in the international arena. In January the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the president's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/">National Security Council</a> (NSC) [official website] is <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-national-security-council-records-not-subject-to-foia.php">not subject</a> [JURIST report] to FOIA. In November the circuit also ruled that the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/drone-memos-may-stay-secret-federal-appeals-court.php">may keep secret memoranda</a> [JURIST report] related to the legal justification for the use of drones for targeted killings of those in other countries believed to be involved in terrorism. The case was the result of FOIA requests by the ACLU and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> [media website] for documents prepared by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc">Office of Legal Counsel of the US Department of Justice</a> [official website] regarding the drone strikes. In June the families of two Yemeni men killed by US drone strikes <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/yemen-drone-strike-victims-families-file-suit-against-us.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the government, claiming they were wrongfully killed. In December 2010 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct targeted killings, a challenge spurred because one subject of a targeted killing, al-Awlaki-Khan, was a dual US-Yemeni citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican <a href="http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/presidencia/presidente/">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> [official profile] sent a proposal to his nation's Senate on Thursday <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/we-are-taking-firm-steps-towards-a-new-paradigm-that-conceives-of-drugs-from-a-preventive-public-health-and-human-rights-approach-epn">to reform</a> [press release] the General Health Law and the Federal Penal Code to relax laws against marijuana, including medical use. The move comes after receiving input from the National Debate Forums on Marijuana Use, which included researchers, institutions of higher education, health professionals and journalists. First, the proposal seeks to authorize the use and importation of all medicine made with marijuana, subject to health laws. Second, the bill would also permit clinical research for medicines containing marijuana. Lastly, should the bill pass, it would decriminalize possession of marijuana of up to 28 grams, or nearly a full ounce, and would release prisoners who were criminally convicted for possessing less than 28 grams of the drug. This last provision would essentially decriminalize personal use of marijuana. Peña Nieto <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/articulos/iniciativa-de-reforma-a-la-ley-general-de-salud-y-al-codigo-penal-federal">stated</a> [press release, in Spanish] that the terms of the debate around drugs are changing in Mexico and in the world and that Mexico recognizes the limitations of an essentially prohibitionist and punitive "war on drugs," which has predominated on an international level for over 40 years. The initiative would be followed by renewed institutional efforts aimed at preventing addictions and the head of the Ministry of Health stated this would lead to more research and greater therapeutic possibilities. </p>

<p>In the US, the <a href="/feature/featured/marijuana-legalization/">legal use and sale of marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] for both medical and recreational purposes has also become a controversial issue, with a number of states contemplating various legalization initiatives. Earlier this week Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/pennsylvania-governor-establishes-statewide-medical-marijuana-program.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing medical marijuana. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-colorado-marijuana-law.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] a case brought by Nebraska and Oklahoma against Colorado, challenging its marijuana laws. In November 2014 voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC, <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/residents-in-alaska-oregon-dc-vote-to-legalize-marijuana.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to legalize recreational marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe on Friday <a href="http://commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/5848/order_restoring_rights_4-22-16.pdf">restored</a> [order, PDF] the voting rights of individuals who have completed the terms of incarceration and have been released from supervised probation or parole for any and all felony convictions. Under the <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article5/section12/">Constitution of Virginia</a> [text], the governor has the power to "remove political disabilities consequent upon conviction for [committed] offenses." The individuals' <a href="http://commonwealth.virginia.gov/judicial-system/restoration-of-rights/">civil rights</a> [official website] restored are the following: the right to vote, serve on a jury, run for office, and become a notary public. The governor's order restores the rights of approximately 206,000 individuals in that state and applies to all Virginians convicted of any felony. The order does not grant automatic right restoration for the future, but McAuliffe has <a href="http://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=15008">pledged</a> [press release] to issue monthly orders restoring rights. Felon disenfranchisement laws have been <a href="http://commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/5843/restore_rights_summary_4-22.pdf">found</a> [summary text, PDF] to have a "disproportionately negative impact African American voters and have at times been used intentionally to consolidate and preserve white control over the political process." Some see this as a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/governor-terry-mcauliffe-virginia-voting-rights-convicted-felons.html?_r=0">strategy</a> [NYT report] to gain more votes for the Democratic Party during the upcoming presidential election by restoring the voting rights of ex-felons who may be mostly African-Americans&#8212;a core constituency of Democrats. </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US, particularly in this election year. This week the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regard the redistricting of voting districts in the state. Also this week, a panel of federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by Representative Corrine Brown that challenged the current congressional district boundaries in Florida. At the beginning of this week, advocacy organization, Election justice USA <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/suit-against-new-york-over-alleged-changes-in-voters-party-registrations-to-be-filed.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a suit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that the state has fraudulently changed the registration of thousands of voters, barring them from voting in the presidential primary. In February a partnership of voting rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/voting-rights-groups-sue-election-official-over-voter-registration.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] suit against the executive director of the US Election Assistance Commission alleging that his recent decision limiting the use of national voter registration in Alabama, Kansas, and Georgia deprives eligible voters from the right to vote. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A divided Kansas Supreme Court <a href="http://www.kscourts.org/Cases-and-Opinions/opinions/SupCt/2016/20160422/108061.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that a lifetime registration as a sex offender does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court heard the case of Henry Petersen-Beard who was convicted as a 19-year-old of raping a 13-year-old girl. The court analyzed whether Petersen-Beard's lifetime registry as a sex offender violated section 9 of the <a href="https://kslib.info/826/Kansas-Bill-of-Rights">Kansas Bill of Rights</a> [text] and the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt8_user.html#amdt8_hd10">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution precluding the state from inflicting cruel or unusual punishment. The court found that lifetime sex offender registration requirements are not punishment for purposes of applying the Kansas Bill of Rights or the US Constitution and are nonpunitive and form a civil regulatory scheme. Decided also on Friday, three other cases <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article73328242.html">found</a> [<em>Kansas City Star</em> report] that registry requirement constituted cruel and unusual punishment and that a <a href="http://josephhollander.com/kansas-sex-offender-registration-laws/">2011 amendment</a> [backgrounder] to the law was in violation of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">Ex Post Facto Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution by acting retroactively. </p>

<p>Changes in the sex-offender registry system have taken place across the country as sex offender laws have been increasingly criticized for limiting residence option and promoting ostracization. Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-reverses-tenth-circuit-on-sex-offender-registration.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that the Sex Offender Notification and Registration Act (SONRA) did not require an individual to update his registration in Kansas once he departed the state and moved to a foreign country. In November, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/kentucky-governor-signs-executive-order-restoring-voting-rights-to-certain-offenders.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order that automatically restored voting rights and the right to hold public office to certain offenders after their sentences had been satisfied; those convicted of sex crimes were excluded from the order. In August, the Massachusetts Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/city-cannot-govern-where-sex-offenders-live-massachusetts-high-court-rules.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a city within the state has no right to pass ordinances restricting where sex offenders can live. In June, the US District Court for the District of Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-court-rules-that-post-sentence-detention-of-sex-offenders-is-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that that state's sex offender program and civil commitment statutes were unconstitutional. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Friday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/court-rules-aclu-lawsuit-against-cia-torture-psychologists-can-proceed">ruled</a> [ACLU press release] that a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/27._defendants_motion_to_dismiss_1.08.16.pdf">lawsuit</a> [brief, PDF] against two former military psychologists who developed the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">CIA's</a> [official website] interrogation program under George W. Bush may proceed. US District Court Judge Justin Quackenbush of the <a href="http://www.waed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Eastern District of Washington</a> [official website] decided that the three plaintiffs, who claim that they were tortured in secret overseas military prisons, may continue with their lawsuit which claims that the two psychologists <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cia-psychologists-idUSKCN0XJ19M">encouraged the CIA</a> [Reuters report] to adopt torture as an official policy and made millions of dollars doing so. The lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/aclu-sues-psychologists-over-cia-torture-program.php">was filed</a> [JURIST report] in October by Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a Tanzanian taken into custody in Somalia, Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a Libyan captured in Pakistan, and Gul Rahman, an Afghan who died in CIA custody in 2002.   </p>

<p>The majority of the ACLU's complaint is based on the so-called <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/sscistudy1.pdf">"Senate Torture Report"</a> [text, PDF] released in December 2014, which found the so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques" employed during the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/senate-report-enhanced-interrogation-techniques-ineffective.php">ineffective</a> [JURIST report]. In February Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-calls-for-medical-treatment-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of the accused 9/11 ringleaders, was in desperate need of medical care in a letter to the Pentagon. In the letter the agency stated that Hawsawi was in severe rectal distress due to interrogation methods that amounted to torture and that he had yet to receive adequate medical care. In June a <a href="/feature/featured/the-legacy-of-guantanamo-bay/">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-wider-use-of-torture-by-cia.php">alleged that the CIA's torture techniques</a> [JURIST report] went beyond those described in the Senate Intelligence Committee report. In December 2014 the UN Special Rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-expert-urges-prosecution-of-us-officials-responsible-for-torture.php">called for the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of CIA and other government officials for the interrogation and torture of detainees. In September 2014 <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/cia-used-extreme-torture-methods-on-terrorist-suspects-report.php">it was claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the CIA used torture methods beyond waterboarding on suspected terrorists, according to a report published by the Telegraph. In August 2014 10 victims of the CIA's extraordinary rendition program <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/cia-rendition-victims-urge-obama-to-name-them-in-senate-report.php">signed an open letter</a> [JURIST report] to US President Barack Obama urging him to declassify the then-upcoming Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Friday dropped a request to force <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] to unlock an iPhone linked to a New York drug case, stating that an individual has provided investigators with the passcode to unlock the phone. Federal prosecutors <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-prosecutors-drop-court-case-to-force-apple-to-unlock-iphone-1461377642">stated</a> [WSJ report] in a letter to US District Judge Margo Brodie of the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] that the passcode did indeed unlock the phone and that they would no longer needs Apple's assistance in doing so. The case involved an iPhone 5s that was seized from Jun Feng in 2014 as part of a drug investigation in New York. Feng pleaded guilty last year, but the legal dispute regarding the phone was still an issue. Initially Feng told investigators that he did not remember the phone's passcode, but according to individuals close to the matter, Feng was the one who provided the passcode this week. Apple had attempted to have the case thrown out, claiming that the government had not exhausted all other options in unlocking the phone.</p>

<p>The US government's authority to have companies like Apple aid them in accessing devices has been a prominent issue recently. In March the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-drops-case-against-apple-aftering-unlocking-iphone.php">dropped its case</a> [JURIST report] seeking to compel Apple to assist unlocking the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone, saying the DOJ has accessed the data itself. The DOJ stated that they may have another method to unlock the shooter's phone and therefore would not need Apple to comply with the order. At the end of February Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-files-objections-to-order-to-unlock-iphone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a brief in the US District Court for the Central District of California in opposition of the US government's request for the company to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook. Counsel for Apple called the case "unprecedented" after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-motion-to-compel-apple-to-unlock-shooters-phone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a motion to compel Apple to unlock the encrypted iPhone. In response to the legal conflict, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-asks-congress-to-create-expert-panel-on-privacy-issues.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US government to create a panel of experts to discuss issues of security versus privacy. These developments came after Apple refused the initial court order to assist the government in unlocking the iPhone from one of the San Bernardino shooter. The court order <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-magistrate-orders-apple-to-assist-us-government-in-unlocking-individuals-phone.php">required</a> [JURIST report] Apple to supply software to the FBI to disable a self-destruct feature that erases phone data after 10 failed attempts to enter the phone's password.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://efactssc-public.flcourts.org/casedocuments/2016/381/2016-381_order_211143.pdf">granted</a> a <a href="https://efactssc-public.flcourts.org/casedocuments/2016/381/2016-381_motion_110251.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] to suspend the state's mandatory 24-hour waiting period for abortions. The ban shall remain suspended until the court determines whether it will accept jurisdiction over the case. The law implementing the waiting period, which was signed by Governor Rick Scott last year, was allowed to go into effect two months ago as the result of an appeals court ruling. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/floridas-24-hour-waiting-period-for-abortions-has-been-suspended/">challenged</a> [CBS News/AP report] the law, arguing that Florida's Constitution protects the private medical decisions of women. </p>

<p>Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. Earlier this month the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-suing-indiana-over-abortion-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state of Indiana, challenging the constitutionality of a recently signed abortion law. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. In March a district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-halts-arkansas-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pill.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Arkansas from enforcing a bill mandating abortion pill providers follow US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and requiring hospital admittance privileges to handle complications. Also in March West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. The same day, South Dakota's governor signed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protections Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egypt's Court of Cassation on Sunday overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, ordering a retrial. The students were <a href="http://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2016/04/24/1056256/egypt-court-overturns-prison-sentence-of-35-al-azhar-students-for-rioting">charged</a> [<em>Tasnim News Agency</em> report] with rioting, illegal protesting, resisting authorities and blocking roads. The rioting charges came as a result of 2014 riots on the <a href="http://www.azhar.edu.eg/">Al-Azhar University</a> [official website, in Arabic] campus, which became violent. The University, located in Cairo, was the site of multiple anti-government and pro-Morsi rallies in 2013 and 2014 following the ousting of former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder]. </p>

<p>This ruling marks the second time in a week that prison sentences against Al-Azhar students have been cancelled. Last week, the Court of Cassation overturned the sentenced of 17 students charged with participating in December 2013 rioting, who had each been sentenced to three years in prison. Legal action was taken against many students who participated in the 2013 and 2014 riots. In November 2014 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/egypt-court-refers-5-students-for-military-trial.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] five students from the university to a military trial over the violent January protest, during which part of a campus building was torched. The referral was made possible under a newly passed law which expanded the army's power to try civilians. In January 2014 a court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/egypt-court-convicts-113-muslim-brotherhood-supporters-in-three-trials.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 26 Al-Azhar students to two-and-a-half years in prison each following a November protest. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladeshi workers gathered Sunday on the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza garment factory disaster to demand justice for the incident that took the lives of more than 1,000 people. A court in Dhaka ruled that 41 defendants can be tried for murder for the April 2013 garment factory collapse. Initially charged with culpable homicide, the defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-garment-factory-owners-charged-with-murder-over-worker-deaths.php">charged with murder</a> [JURIST report] upon further investigation of their conduct. Investigators found that the defendants illegally added floors to the original five-story Rana Complex to compete in Bangladesh's highly profitable garment exporting industry. Prior to the building's collapse, the staff allegedly forced workers to stay in the unstable establishment despite concerns that the structure was visibly cracking. The building owner, Sohel Rana, is now <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/21/bangladesh-court-accepts-murder-charges-in-factory-collapse-case.html">being held in jail</a> [AP report] while 16 others are free on bail. Workers protested on Sunday at the grave site where <a href="http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-24/bangladesh-workers-demand-justice-on-disaster-anniversary/7354188">hundreds were buried</a> [AFP report], demanding justice for the deceased. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Bangladesh in September <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/bangladesh-high-courts-lifts-ban-on-garment-factory-documentary.php">lifted a ban</a> [JURIST report] on the release of a documentary film that depicted the rescue of a woman 17 days after the 2013 garment factory disaster. The accident <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html?pagewanted=all">drew attention</a> [NYT report] to the plight of the poor in Bangladesh. In response, Bangladesh lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/bangladesh-lawmakers-approve-changes-to-labor-law.php">approved new labor laws</a> [JURIST report] in July 2013, which permitted unions greater power in the nation but created barriers to entry that some argue are impractically high. The changes came in an effort to update the Bangladeshi laws to meet international standards. Bangladesh has ratified most of the core <a href="http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/promoting-international-labor-standards/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> [official website] labor standards, including Convention No. 87 on freedom of association and Convention No. 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. According to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html">World Factbook</a> [website], exports totaled USD $28.62 billion in 2013 and an estimated $31.2 billion in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/HousingIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on the right to housing</a> [official website] Leilani Farha <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19861&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] on Friday that homelessness is India is a major problem. Farha called on the government of India to take immediate action to ensure adequate housing for the disadvantaged within the country. She stated, "I am extremely concerned for the millions of people who experience exclusion, discrimination, evictions, insecure tenure, homelessness and who lack hope of accessing affordable and adequate housing in their lifetimes." She pointed out that most of the time evictions are carried out without any warning and that these atrocities affect the most vulnerable populations in India. Earlier in March, Farha warned that <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17134&LangID=E">homelessness is increasing</a> [press release] in every country due to government inaction. Presenting a <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/294/52/PDF/G1529452.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] to the UN Human Rights Council, Farha said that homelessness has become a global crisis because of government failure to respond to structural issues and legislation that allows for the displacement of individuals.</p>

<p>Homelessness remains a problem throughout the world. In August the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-government-challenges-idaho-law-for-criminalizing-homeless.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] an Idaho city ordinance that criminalizes sleeping in public places by the homeless. In October Farha said that governments must <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-expert-bold-action-needed-to-end-homelessness.php">commit</a> [JURIST report] themselves to further action to improve housing conditions and urban development. Guest Columnist Azariah Jelks of Valparaiso University Law <a href="/dateline/2015/12/Azariah-Jelks-Affordable-Housing.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] in December that affordable housing must become a reality because the current affordable housing initiatives are unable to assist every family or individual from being displaced and priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] on Monday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/Pages/otp-stat-25-04-2016.aspx">announced</a> [press release] a "preliminary investigation" into allegations that the Burundi government, headed by President Pierre Nkurunziza, committed various human rights violations over the past year. In a statement to the media, Bensouda said that "more than 430 persons were reportedly killed, at least 3,400 people have been arrested and over 230,000 Burundians forced to seek refuge in neighboring countries," and that the government has perpetrated "acts of killing, imprisonment, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as cases of enforced disappearances." Urging that this is not an investigation, but rather a review of available evidence to determine whether an investigation is appropriate, Bensouda pledged to work closely with Burundi authorities in seeking a resolution to these problems. </p>

<p>As a signatory to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], all acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Burundi are within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The ICC is not the only concerned international party, however, as earlier in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-chief-warns-of-increased-torture-illegal-detention-in-burundi.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of an increase in torture and ill treatment in Burundi. In the last four months Zeid's office has recorded more than 300 new cases of torture and ill-treatment. The human rights chief asked the Burundi government to put an immediate end to these "unacceptable and illegal practices." Violence in Burundi began in the wake of Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, to which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] in July. In March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Zeid expressed concern over increased violence and rights violations in Burundi and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-calls-for-inclusive-political-dialogue-to-end-burundi-crisis.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an "inclusive political dialogue" to end the 11-year struggle. The Burundi government, however, has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-not-allowed-to-enter-burundi.php">resistant</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">investigation</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Civil rights lawyer Ni Yulan <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN0XM11P">told Western media</a> [Reuters report] Monday that the Chinese government has put her under house arrest, presumably for her work as an advocate for citizens being evicted to make way for development. Foreign diplomats from the EU, Germany, Canada, France and Switzerland sought to meet with Ni at her home over the weekend but were turned away by Chinese police officers. Ni, who won the US State Department's <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/programs/iwoc/2016/index.htm">International Women of Courage Award</a> [official website] earlier this year, but was not allowed to leave China to accept it, expects to be evicted from her home but has been prevented from seeking a new dwelling. When asked about Ni's situation, US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">John Kerry</a> [official profile] she has paid a "steep price" as an advocate. Ni has been relegated to a wheelchair since 2002, when police beat her for videoing the forced demolition of a client's home. Ni also had adverse run-ins with the police in <a href="https://chrdnet.com/2008/12/beijing-housing-rights-activist-ni-yulan-sentenced-to-two-years/">2008</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/china-activist-sentenced-to-prison-for-inciting-disturbance-fraud.php">2012</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/china-court-dismisses-fraud-charges-against-human-rights-lawyer.php">jailed</a> [reports] for "making trouble."</p>

<p>In an apparent attempt to quiet dissidents, the Chinese government has been cracking down on rights lawyers since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013. Earlier this month, Ge Yongxi, a civil rights defense lawyer, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">detained and released</a> [JURIST report] by Chinese authorities for posts on social media that "poked fun" at Xi Jinping for the Panama Papers. Shortly before, Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that his license to practice law was revoked by the judicial bureau because of a December criminal conviction for with using social media to critique the government. In March, Chinese lawyer Chen Taihe <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">fled his country</a> [JURIST report] for California, after he was detained in July for "picking quarrels and stirring up trouble." During that particular assault on lawyers, at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout China. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/042516zor_jifl.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-5991.htm">Shaw v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SHAW-Pet..pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine the level of intent that must be proven for a bank fraud conviction. The Supreme Court ruled in 2014 in <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-no-proof-of-intent-required-for-federal-bank-fraud-conviction.php">Loughrin v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that prosecution under subsection (2) of the federal government's <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1344">anti-bank fraud statute</a> [text] does not require proof that a defendant intended to defraud a financial institution, leaving open the question of intent under subsection (1). The question before the court in <span class="casename">Shaw</span> is, "Whether subsection (1)'s "scheme to defraud a financial institution" requires proof of a specific intent not only to deceive, but also to cheat, a bank,  as nine circuits have held, and as petitioner Lawrence Shaw argued here."</p>

<p>Also Monday the court agreed to hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-7250.htm">Manrique v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-7250.htm">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether a notice of appeal from a sentencing judgment deferring restitution is effective to challenge the validity of a later-issued restitution award. Marvelo Manrique was convicted of possessing child pornography. He was sentenced to six years in prison and a life term of supervision, but a federal judge ruled that an award of restitution had to be made to the child, with the amount to be determined at a later hearing. Manrique filed a formal notice that he was appealing the sentence. The judge later ordered restitution of $4,500, but Manrique did not file a new notice that he was appealing, relying on the earlier notice. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that it <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14-13029-2015-07-15.pdf">could not rule on the restitution appeal</a> [opinion, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Kate Gilmore <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19871&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Iraq on Monday to take concrete steps to plan for "the day after" the defeat of the Islamic State (IS). The statements come after a week-long visit to Iraq that included the cities of Baghdad, Najaf, Erbil and the Shariya camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Dohuk. She called on all the leaders of Iraq to demonstrate a commitment to peace, equality and the rule of law. The senior UN official also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53773#.Vx5c8WOprbA">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] that military challenges in some parts of the country do not "justify or excuse the absence of the rule of law in the broader Iraq." She maintained the need for an end to arbitrary detention, respect for due process, the prohibition of torture and judicial independence as "indispensable" foundations of stability. Gilmore called on the international community to aid Iraq in its humanitarian needs, the building of infrastructure and towards national reconciliation. </p>

<p>Iraq has faced significant challenges in recent years with providing basic infrastructure and a stable government. Last week protestors came together in Baghdad to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/protesters-in-baghdad-demand-new-government-amid-political-reforms.php">demand</a> [JURIST report] a new government amid the third parliament session cancelled that week as officials discuss political reforms. Earlier this month Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-calls-on-iraqi-forces-to-allow-civilian-aid-during-siege.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Iraqi forces to allow aid such as food and medicine into Fallujah as the armed siege is producing acute shortages. Last month US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that IS is "responsible for genocide" against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-25-16.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-375_4fc5.pdf">Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF], the court must determine what constitutes the standard for awarding attorney's fees under § 505 of the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copyright Act</a> [text]. Under the act, the district court is permitted to use its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to a prevailing party in a copyright action. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/op-below-kirtsaeng.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a finding that John Wiley's course of action in challenging Kirtsaeng's use of copyrighted material was objectively reasonable. Counsel for the petitioner argued, "[w]hen a defendant is trying to decide whether to fight for a principle, the availability of attorneys' fees can make all the difference in that decision, and in turn can make all the difference in whether the public's rights are vindicated."</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-446_2dp3.pdf">Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee</a> [transcript, PDF], the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cuozzo-op-below.pdf">determined</a> [opinion, PDF] it lacks jurisdiction to review the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>'s (PTO) implementation of inter partes review, and the court affirmed the PTO's order that Cuozzo's trademark should remain unaltered. Global Positioning System (GPS) manufacturer <a href="http://www.garmin.com/en-US">Garmin</a> [official website] requested the PTO review Cuozzo's trademark on speed indicator technology, alleging that multiple parts were ambiguous. Cuozzo requested to revise those portions, but instead the PTO found that no changes should be made. The Supreme Court is now asked by Cuozzo to determine the court of appeals' jurisdiction to review inter partes review decisions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A panel of experts released on Sunday its second and last <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/nytimes.com/file/d/0B3wuz7S3S9urY2YzdjlrUmpSQTQ/view?pref=2&pli=1">report</a> [text in Spanish, PDF] on its inquiry into the 43 undergraduate students from a teachers college in Ayotzinapa who went missing in Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico in 2014, stating that the Mexican government has hampered the investigation. Consisting of Latin American lawyers and human rights activists, the panel of experts appointed by the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website] found the following: some of the suspects had been tortured by government security forces; the integrity of evidence had been compromised in the case; new evidence showed a greater role by federal security forces in the 2014 events; a lack of investigation into high-level officials; a lack of investigation into phone records from that night; and "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/world/americas/inquiry-challenges-mexicos-account-of-how-43-students-vanished.html?_r=0">sclerotic bureaucracy</a>" [NYT report] throughout the justice system. The experts brought together the events leading up to the disappearances of the students through witness testimony and ballistic tests; they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/25/world/americas/missing-mexican-students-suffered-a-night-of-terror-investigators-say.html">concluded</a> [NYT report] that "the join action [of the attackers and officials] shows a coordinated modus operandi [...]". The experts have denounced the Mexican government for failing to fully cooperate with the investigation and taking steps to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/24/mexico-43-missing-students-investigation-iachr-report">discredit</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the group. The experts had been invited by the Mexican government to examine the case and the former's mandate is due to expire next week. It will not be extended, according to Mexican authorities. </p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" width="480" height="321" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000004359036"></iframe></div>

<p>The disappearance of the 43 students has drawn widespread condemnation of the criminal justice system in Mexico. In January, three men were [JURIST report] arrested for their possible connection to the disappearance as part of the government's story. In November Mexico's own National Human Rights Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/mexico-commission-criticizes-ag-for-missing-43-investigation.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Mexican Attorney General's Office and other government offices involved in the investigation for failing to comply with its recommendations. In October Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hrw-evidence-of-unlawful-police-killings-in-mexico.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that there was evidence of unlawful police killing in the country. Also in October, Mexican Attorney General Arely Gómez González <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/mexicos-attorney-general-releases-case-file-on-missing-students.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a 54,000 page file detailing the Mexican government's investigation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="http://mediaweb.wsoctv.com/document_dev/2016/04/25/VIVA%20Decision_3993915_ver1.0.pdf">upheld</a> [ruling, PDF] the state's voter ID law on Monday. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiexM2Ax6zMAhWLOD4KHV2WBvgQFggjMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncga.state.nc.us%2FSessions%2F2013%2FBills%2FHouse%2FPDF%2FH589v8.pdf&usg=AFQjCNELyi27mNEcYC0FgqSUpXvq2fNLvQ&sig2=_IMmO940nZZXIznW_AODug">House Bill 589</a> [materials] requires that any "qualified voter voting in person ... shall present identification" to a "local election official at the voting place before voting." The law also provides, however, that those who do not have a license may file a declaration that a "reasonable impediment prevented them from acquiring qualifying photo ID." This "reasonable impediment" provision was a major factor in the judge's decision, as the court rejected the plaintiffs' contentions that the law was discriminatory. In particular, the court held that African American and Hispanic voters did not suffer a lessened ability, when compared to non-minorities, to participate in voting and the political process. The ruling was not unexpected, as the judge had previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-judge-rules-north-carolina-voter-id-law-can-take-effect-in-march-elections.php">declined to block</a> [JURIST report] the state from implementing its voter ID law in the most recent primary. Plaintiffs have already pledged to appeal.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Earlier this month a federal appeals court held that a Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. In March a federal appeals court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In March of last year Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration. A federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/federal-appeals-courts-overturns-citizenship-proof-rule-for-kansas-voters.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Kansas rule that required prospective voters to show proof-of-citizenship documents before registering using a federal voter registration form in November 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's <a href="http://www.tsj.gob.ve/">Supreme Tribunal of Justice</a> (STJ) [official website, in Spanish] on Monday rejected an attempt by the opposition-led National Assembly to shorten President Nicolas Maduro's term from six years to four. The opposition, which won control of the National Assembly last year, has been attempting to oust Maduro. The STJ held that the proposed constitutional amendment would be viable if approved by referendum but could <a href="http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/315398/tsj-dice-que-la-enmienda-constitucional-no-podria-ser-aplicada-al-presidente-maduro/">not apply retroactively</a> [Noticias24 report, in Spanish]. Venezuelan law does allow for a recall election halfway through an official's term. If Maduro were to leave office or be ousted this year, a new election would be held. If he were to leave office in the last two years of his term, the vice president would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN0XM2BD">assume the presidency</a> [Reuters report].</p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government STJ and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December election. Last week the assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">approved new new referendum rules</a> [JURIST report] to speed up the process of requesting recall referendums. Last month the STJ ruled that the Venezuelan national assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review the appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party. The 13 justices were sworn in on December 23, immediately prior to the exit of prior Socialist Party majority. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">upheld Maduro's economic emergency decree</a> [JURIST report] as legal and valid despite a rejection by the national assembly. The decree allows the president to control the budget, companies and the currency. In January the STJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">ruled that all decisions from the opposition-led assembly would be void</a> [JURIST report] until three opposition lawmakers were removed from their seats. The court's decision came days after the assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-swears-in-3-elected-lawmakers-barred-by-supreme-court-ruling.php">swore in elected lawmakers</a> that were temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">barred by the court</a> [JURIST reports]. The ruling had suspended four elected lawmakers for their involvement in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/venezuela-socialist-party-challenges-recent-election-of-opposition-politicians.php">alleged election fraud last December</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Papua New Guinea <a href="http://www.pngjudiciary.gov.pg/home/index.php/supreme-court">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/04/26/PNG_SC_judgement.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Tuesday that Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island in northern Papua New Guinea is illegal. The court found that the detention center violates article 42 of Papua New Guinea's <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Papua_New_Guinea_2014?lang=en">constitution</a> [text], which guarantees personal liberty. The court ordered both governments to take steps to end the detention. Australia's Minister for Immigration and Border Protection <a href="http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/2016/Pages/png-supreme-court-judgement.aspx">said</a> [press release] Tuesday that the ruling, "does not alter Australia's border protection policies&#8212;they remain unchanged. No one who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat will settle in Australia." There are currently about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-36136629">850 detainees</a> [BBC report] on Manus Island, half of whom have been determined to be refugees.</p>

<p>Tuesday's ruling is in direct conflict with a recent decision by the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website], which ruled in February that the country's offshore detention policy for asylum seekers is <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">legal</a> [JURIST report], rejecting a challenge that it violates the Australian constitution. The challenge was brought by lawyers for a female Bangladeshi detainee who was brought to Australia for medical reasons. Under the controversial policy, those who seek asylum in Australia arriving by boat are detained on the island nation of Nauru or on Manus Island. The policy has generated outcry from human rights advocates and some politicians. In October <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said that Australia's maritime border control agents have engaged in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-australia-maritime-border-control-abusing-asylum-seekers.php">significant criminal activity</a> [JURIST report], bribery, and abusive treatment of women, men, and children who are seeking asylum. In February 2014 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] called for changes to the way Australia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/UN-human-rights-office-urges-Australia-reconsider-asylum-policy.php">deals with refugees</a> [JURIST report] seeking asylum, especially in regards to the lengthy detention of asylum-seekers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that states should make it easier for convicted felons to obtain state-issued identification cards upon their release from prison. Lynch's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-delivers-remarks-national-reentry-week-event">remarks</a> [transcript] were delivered at the start of National Reentry Week, during which the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-new-reforms-strengthen-federal-bureau-prisons">announced</a> [press release] the "<a href="/reentry/file/844356/download">Roadmap to Reentry</a>" [text, PDF], the DOJ&#8217;s comprehensive vision to reduce recidivism through reentry reforms at the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The principles outlined in the roadmap include individualized reentry plans, education and other programming during incarceration, maintaining relationships with family members, utilizing halfway houses and supervised released programs to ensure continuity, and providing access to resources. Speaking at an event in Philadelphia, Lynch stressed the importance of access to state-issued IDs:<blockquote>In addition to the efforts described in the Roadmap, I am pleased to tell you that today, I am sending a letter to the governors of each of the 50 states, inviting them to work with the Department of Justice to help citizens return to their states from federal prisons. Specifically, I am asking each state to work with us to allow citizens returning from federal prisons to exchange their federal BOP inmate ID card&#8212;and their authenticated release documentation&#8212;for a state-issued ID. Or, alternatively, states could accept BOP identification cards and release papers as supporting documentation towards obtaining a state-issued ID. This basic step would have a powerful impact. As a practical matter, it would standardize the current patchwork of state policies around providing returning citizens with identification and it would eliminate one of the most common&#8212;and most harmful&#8212;barriers to reentry across the United States.  But even more important is the message that such a program would send to returning citizens: that they are welcome back into society; that their government is invested in their success; and that they can now&#8212;quite literally&#8212;exchange their old identity as a federal inmate for a fresh start. I cannot imagine a simpler or more profound way for every state to signal their commitment to improving reentry outcomes and I urge every governor in the United States to join me in making this proposal a reality.</blockquote>National Reentry Week events are planned across the country.</p>

<p>The rights of convicted felons are controversial, and state policies vary. Last week Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-governor-restores-voting-rights-for-ex-felons.php">restored the voting rights</a> [JURIST report] of individuals who have completed the terms of incarceration and have been released from supervised probation or parole for any and all felony convictions. The DOJ has also taken other steps toward criminal justice reform. Last month the DOJ urged state <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">court systems</a> [JURIST report] to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-resources-assist-state-and-local-reform-fine-and-fee-practices">profit off poor defendants</a> [press release]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-26-16.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in two cases Tuesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-6092_k53l.pdf">Mathis v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on "whether a court can consider a statute or subsection, outside of the convicting statute, that defines a term in the convicting statute." Richard Mathis was convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm and received an enhanced sentence under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [18 USC § 924(e)]. The ACCA applies to individuals convicted of three prior violent felonies. Mathis alleges that his five prior convictions of second-degree burglary are non-violent under the ACCA as they do not qualify as "burglary" contemplated in the language of the ACCA.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-458_k5fm.pdf">Dietz v. Bouldin</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether a judge may recall jurors for further service in the same case after the jury has been dismissed and the jurors have left the judge's presence. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a district court could <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dietz-op-below.pdf">re-empanel a jury shortly after dismissal</a> [opinion, PDF], "but only if, during the period of dismissal, the jurors were not exposed to any outside influences that would compromise their ability to fairly reconsider the verdict."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.redskins.com/">Washington Redskins</a> of the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/">National Football League</a> (NFL) [official websites] on Monday filed a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Redskins-petition-5-25-16.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] asking it to review a <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/local/judges-ruling-on-redskins-trademark/1750/">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] that upheld the cancellation of the Redskins trademark. The Redskins requested that the court not consider the case unless it also takes up a similar disparaging trademark case involving a band named <a href="http://www.theslants.com/">"The Slants"</a> [official website]. In December, after the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">USPTO</a> [official website] rejected The Slants' name as being disparaging, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-government-cannot-reject-offensive-trademarks.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a provision of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/lanham_act">1946 Lanham Act</a> [LII materials], which holds that trademarks could be cancelled if they "may disparage ... persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute," was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. In the petition, the Redskins asked that the court not consider this provision's constitutionality until after their appeal with the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website], but also mentioned that if the court were to take up the Slants case, then it should hear the Redskins case as well since it is an essential and vital compliment to the Slants case.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding disparaging trademarks and names over the past few years due to the Redskins case. In August 2014 the Washington Redskins <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/nfls-washington-redskins-file-appeal-in-trademark-ruling.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in federal court to challenge a June ruling by the Trademark Trial and Appeals Board of the USPTO that found the name "Redskins" is "disparaging of Native Americans." The Redskins faced a similar ruling by the Board in 1999, which was later overturned on appeal. The August complaint marked the beginning of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2014/06/19/3450729/redskins-trademark-decision-cost-lots-of-money/">new litigation</a> [Think Process report], but many of the issues from earlier cases remained unchanged. In June 2014 the USPTO announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/us-patent-office-cancels-washington-redskins-trademark-registration.php">cancel six trademark registrations</a> [JURIST report] belonging to the Washington Redskins. Administrative trademark judge Karen Kuhlke cancelled trademarks associated with the team's name, logo and the name of their cheerleading squad. The Washington Redskins' name was <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-rights-expert-calls-for-washington-redskins-name-change.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, who called in April of last year for the team to change their name out of respect for the "historical and cultural legacy of the Native Americans in the US."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1280_k5fl.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/heffernan-v-paterson/">Heffernan v. City of Paterson</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that when an employer demotes an employee based on participation in a protected political activity, the employee is entitled to challenge the demotion under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983">Section 1983</a> [LII materials] and the First Amendment, even when the employer demoted the employee based on an incorrect factual understanding of the employee's political activities. The court, in a 6-2 opinion authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, stated that the heart of the matter was the employer's motive and reasons for demoting the employee and not the employee's actions. The court distinguished <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3521929082371837035&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Waters v. Churchill</a> [opinion], which involved the inverse situation in which the employer did not know the content of the employee's speech and acted on a mistaken belief that it was not protected by the First Amendment. In this case, even though the employer was mistaken in what political speech it thought the employee was engaged in, the speech was nevertheless protected by the First Amendment, and the employer knew this. Breyer penned, "After all, in law, what is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander."</p>

<p>The case concerns <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/01/argument-preview-the-first-amendment-public-employment-and-misperceived-political-association/">Jeffrey Heffernan</a> [SCOTUSblog report], a detective and later chief of police in New Jersey who, because it was perceived that he supported an opposing mayoral candidate, was demoted from his office to that of a patrol officer. A fellow officer thought that he saw Heffernan holding a yard sign and speaking with campaign workers for the challenger candidate. However, Heffernan was actually picking up a sign for his bedridden mother, whose sign had been stolen from her yard. He was subsequently demoted. The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] rejected his claim that his demotion was violative of the First Amendment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following an earlier court decision, Belgiam authorities on Wednesday completed the extradition of a terror suspect to France. Salah Abdeslam who is thought to be the criminal mastermind of the Paris terror attacks last year was <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20160427-paris-attacks-suspect-salah-abdeslam-extradited-france-terrorism">extradited</a> [France24 report] into French custody. Abdeslam is still facing charges in Belgium in connection with a terror attack in Brussels earlier this year. The transfer will allow the French authorities to complete their investigation of the attacks in Paris and begin judicial proceedings against the terror suspects. </p>

<p>Following a court decision in Brussels in April, Belgian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/belgium-to-extradite-terror-suspect-to-france.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report]  to extradite Abdeslam to France. The <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-experts-paris-attacks-may-be-crimes-against-humanity.php">attacks</a> [JURIST report] in Paris took place on November 13, 2015, beginning with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France around 9:20 PM local time. Soon thereafter, individuals riding in a Seat brand car opened fire on individuals outside cafes around Paris. At around 9:40 PM, assailants fired on concert-goers at the Bataclan concert hall, killing 89.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 700 citizens and residents of Japan <a href="http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160427/p2g/00m/0dm/024000c">filed lawsuits</a> [Kyodo News report] against the government Tuesday over new security laws that would allow the deployment of troops abroad to defend allies. The measure, backed by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19725705">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> [BBC profile], would allow for Japan to work with other international government entities in the fight against terrorism. Of concern for many plaintiffs is that the new laws could bring terrorism to the shores of Japan, destroying their <a href="http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201603280029.html">traditional</a> [Asahi Shinbun report] way of life. Furthermore some of the litigators are educators who believe that in order to teach the constitution to their pupils, they would have to include the security measures that are at odds with the principles in the document. The litigants are suing for compensation for the harm they have and will receive in the future.</p>

<p>The security law took effect last month after being <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/japans-house-of-parliament-approves-deployment-of-troops-abroad.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the upper house of parliament in September. The legislation <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/09/japan-passes-law-allowing-troops-fight-150918125944422.html">passed the lower house</a> [Al Jazeera report] in July. The measure faced substantial opposition within Japan. Opponents of the law are upset that the law contradicts pacifist provisions in the <a href="http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html">constitution of Japan</a> [text], specifically Article 9, which states: "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." Abe <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/19/world/asia/japan-parliament-passes-legislation-combat-role-for-military.html?_r=0">argues</a> [NYT report] that the national military must take a more active role in order to strengthen its position against growing military power in China and a nuclear-armed North Korea. The government put limits on military deployments in the new law, but critics argue those limitations are extremely vague.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for Arizona's <a href="https://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/">Superior Court of Maricopa County</a> [official website] on Wednesday<a href="/paperchase/CV2016-002889%20Brakey%20v%20Secretary%20of%20State%20et%20al%20Ruling.pdf">dismissed</a> [ruling, PDF] a lawsuit alleging fraud and other grievances from the primary elections in Arizona for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. The plaintiff, John Brakey, alleged that the primary voting in Arizona was hampered with problems including a limited number of polling places, extended wait times and issues with the ballots. The plaintiff alleged that votes could have been tampered with and urged the court to order a new election. The court found that even with the evidence being taken as true, Brakey could not prove his allegations and meet the burden to prevent a dismissal:<blockquote>Throughout the case, plaintiff conceded that he likely could not show that the allegations, if true, would have changed the outcome of the election. However, plaintiff also did not completely concede that point. Indeed, at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, after the testimony by Ms. Tunnell from MCED, plaintiff suggested that alleged fraud and misconduct might have changed the allocation of delegates to the national convention by congressional district based on the Arizona Democratic Party's bylaws. However, even if adequately proven, it was not proof that it would have changed the outcome of the election itself.</blockquote>Brakey does <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/26/judge-tosses-lawsuit-challenging-arizona-presidential-primary-results/83561630/">not plan to appeal</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report]. </p>

<p>Issues with voting have plagued Arizona in recent months. The Supreme Court in April unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona commission's decisions regarding the redistricting of voting districts in the state. The claim from Republicans in the state was that the reapportionment of votes resulted in a discriminatory distribution favoring the Democratic Party. In the same month the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/doj-investigating-voting-issues-in-arizona-primary.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] Maricopa County officials that it would investigate the issues voters in Arizona's most populous county faced during the March 22 primary election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/DayCall_04-27-16.pdf">heard oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] Wednesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-474_1bn2.pdf">McDonnell v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF]. The court is being asked to decide the meaning of "official action" under the fraud statutes used to convict former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell for taking official action to benefit a benefactor. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/docs/pdfs/154019p.pdf?sfvrsn=2">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] McDonnell's corruption conviction for accepting money in exchange for assisting a Virginia company in securing university testing of a dietary supplement. Counsel for McDonnell argued, "In order to engage in "official action," an official must either make a government decision or urge someone else to do so. The line is between access to decisionmakers on the one hand and trying to influence those decisions on the other." Analysts predict that the court is <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-looks-likely-to-throw-out-former-virginia-gov-bob-mcdonnells-conviction-1461775534">likely to throw out</a> [WSJ report] McDonnell's conviction.</p>

<p>In 2014 McDonnell and his wife Maureen were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/03/bob-mcdonnell-corruption-trial/13484543/">accused</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the CEO of Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for favors for and promotions of the company. During the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/local/timeline-the-mcdonnell-corruption-trial/1225/">trial</a> [WP timeline] damning evidence was produced showing how the McDonnells frequently promoted the dietary supplements of Star Scientific. The McDonnells were found guilty of the 11 counts of corruption, and Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years and Maureen received a sentence of one year and one day. An attorney for Bob McDonnell <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/former-virginia-governor-will-appeal-public-corruption-conviction.php">said he would appeal</a> [JURIST report] his public corruption convictions to the Supreme Court after the Fourth Circuit refused to reconsider the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Residents of Flint, Michigan, represented by attorney <a href="http://pittlawpc.com/attorney-profiles/michael-l-pitt/">Michael Pitt</a> [professional profile], <a href="http://www.flintwaterclassaction.com/wp-content/uploads/Flint-EPA-Complaint.pdf">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] an administrative complaint against the <a href="www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] Monday for negligence in handling the Flint water crisis. The suit alleges that the EPA was notified of contamination in the Flint water supply long before acting in any substantive way to mitigate the harm or properly investigate the complaints. As a result of their inaction, the residents of Flint allege they were subjected to lead in their water supply for over a year causing physical injury to themselves and their property:<blockquote>As a result of the EPA's negligence claimants have experienced and will continue to experience physical injury, illness lead poisoning, dermatological disorders, loss of hair, gastrointestinal disorders, out of pocket economic losses; claimants have experienced and will continue to experience pain and suffering, emotional distress, deprivation of a quality of life; claimants have experienced property damage to real estate and personal property; claimants have experienced a loss of property value.</blockquote>The suit is seeking over $200 million in damages. </p>

<p>Numerous lawsuits have been filed in response to the water contamination in Flint. David Leyton, a prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, announced last week that a Michigan judge will <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/officials-facing-criminal-charges-over-flint-water-crisis.php">allow criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against three people involved in the water crisis in Flint, including the man who supervised the treatment plan as well as two state environmental officials. Earlier this month, the city of Flint <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/city-of-flint-files-intent-to-sue-letter-with-state-no-suit-yet.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an intent to sue letter with the state, claiming that the city lacks funds to defend itself against lawsuit filed during the water crisis. Hertz Schram PC , a southeastern Michigan firm, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-flint-children-exposed-to-water.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit in March on behalf of the children in Flint who were injured by exposure to the high levels of lead in the city's drinking water. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert was <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/310692553/Transcript-of-Dennis-Hastert-Witnesses-Comments">sentenced</a> [transcript] Wednesday to 15 months in prison on bank fraud charges relating to his payment of hush money to alleged sexual abuse victims. In Judge Thomas Durkin's federal district courtroom, Hastert admitted for the first time that he sexually abused student athletes while working as a teacher in Illinois. The statute of limitations on the abuse allegations had expired, and so Durkin's sentencing of 15 months in prison, with two years of subsequent supervision and a $250,000 fine, relate to Hastert's structured withdrawal of money below bank reporting requirements. When federal investigators began inquiry into Hastert's withdrawals, he initially told them he was being extorted by an anonymous individual, when in reality he was paying that individual to hush sexual assault allegations. Durkin vowed to take Hastert's lies into consideration during sentencing, after Hastert pleaded guilty last fall. On his sentence, Hastert's attorney stated:<blockquote>Mr. Hastert accepts the sentence imposed by the court today. As he made clear in his own words in addressing the court, he takes sole responsibility for this tragic situation and deeply apologizes to all those affected by his actions. He hopes that he now can focus on addressing his health issues and on healing the emotional damage that has been inflicted on his family and friends who have shown unwavering support throughout this trying time.</blockquote>The anonymous victim <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-individual-a-sues-dennis-hastert-20160425-story.html">filed</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] a breach of contract lawsuit against Hastert on Monday, seeking an additional $1.8 million from his agreement with Hastert to keep the allegations from going public. </p>

<p>An investigation by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> indicated that <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-dennis-hastert-investigation-met-20160406-story.html">at least four people have made "credible allegations" against Hastert</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report]. Earlier this month, Hastert, in a sentencing memorandum, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/former-speaker-hastert-pleads-for-probation-in-sentencing-memorandum.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the court to spare him jail time and impose a sentence of probation. The memorandum first acknowledged Hastert's past actions and stated that he was "deeply sorry" for such actions before discussing how throughout his life he has been committed to service and "enriched the lives of so many." The memorandum further noted that Hastert "regrets that he resorted to structuring the withdrawal of his money from banks in an effort to prevent the disclosure of that misconduct" and that he "apologize[d] to his family, friends, former constituents, and all others affected by his misconduct."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Tennessee <a href="https://www.tn.gov/governor">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website] on Wednesday announced that he signed into law a <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/109/Amend/HA1006.pdf">bill</a> [HB 1840, text] allowing therapists to refuse to treat patients based on religious objections, when that patient's "goals, outcomes or behaviors" conflict with the counselor's "sincerely held principles." The bill permits therapists to refuse service only if the individual is not in imminent danger, and if the counselor provides a referral to another therapist for treatment. On the bill, Haslam stated:<blockquote>the substance of this bill doesn't address a group, issue or belief system. Rather, it allows counselors&mdash;just as we allow other professionals like doctors and lawyers&mdash;to refer a client to another counselor when the goals or behaviors would violate a sincerely held principle. I believe it is reasonable to allow these professionals to determine if and when an individual would be better served by another counselor better suited to meet his or her needs.</blockquote>In reaction, the <a href="https://www.counseling.org/">American Counseling Association</a> [advocacy website], through spokesperson Art Terrazas, asserted that the bill not only disproportionately affects LGBTQ Tennesseans seeking counseling, but will also have unintended consequences, "whether it's [on] a veteran suffering from PTSD, a woman suffering from spousal abuse or a business owner simply trying to attract out of state client." The bill passed the state senate in February, and the house in April. </p>

<p>The intersection of religious liberty and sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. Earlier this month Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/louisiana-govenor-signs-order-banning-LGBT-discrimination.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order that creates a new anti-discrimination law intended to protect members of the LGBT community. Prior to signing the executive order, there was no state law in Louisiana protecting LGBT individuals from employment discrimination. Shortly before, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a religious freedom bill that critics claim would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe also <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=14787">vetoed</a> [press release] a similar bill in March. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] during a press conference that he will not defend House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. That legislation <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">specifically prohibits</a> [JURIST report] local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination ordinances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-04/28/c_135320906.htm">passed a new law</a> [Xinhua report] Thursday restricting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and subjecting them to intense governmental scrutiny and other obligations such as reporting their sources of income and increasing the number of reasons for which their licenses will be revoked, including spreading rumors. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/china-scrap-foreign-ngo-law-aimed-at-choking-civil-society">stated</a> [press release] that under the new law, "authorities&#8212;particularly the police&#8212;will have virtually unchecked powers to target NGOs, restrict their activities, and ultimately stifle civil society," and argued that the new law should be repealed. This new law was passed in the light of a recent 2015 victory by environmental NGOs over mining companies that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/china-court-finds-in-favor-of-ngos-under-new-environmental-law.php">particularly contributed to pollution</a> [JURIST report], which had encouraged international advocacy groups.  </p>

<p>China first began to enact regulations aimed at hindering NGOs in 2012. The introduction of a bill aimed to step up supervision of the fast-growing sector, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-12/22/c_133871538.htm">state media said</a> [Xinhua report]. Many other countries, such as Russia, have recently enacted <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=non-governmental%20organizations&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">NGO regulations and restrictions</a>  [JURIST news archive]. Many critics of these laws consider them to be an <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/russia-enacts-law-enabling-snap-inspections-of-ngos.php">effort to curb free speech</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">Russian law</a> [JURIST report], signed by <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] in July 2012, labels all NGOs that engage in political activity as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry before receiving any foreign funding. Both former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern over the law's impact on freedom of speech. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/699/actions">voted unanimously</a> [bill history] Wednesday to pass the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20160425/HR699.pdf">Email Privacy Act"</a> [HR 699, PDF]. The purpose of the bill is to protect the e-mail correspondence of American citizens, as under the current Electronic Communications Privacy Act, passed in 1986, local and federal police agencies have the ability to read e-mails at will that are at least six months old. The amendment has been part of an  attempt to move privacy legislation into the 21st Century and to update electronic information laws to reflect current usage and technology. The bill, introduced by Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-KS) in 2015, must be sent to the Senate and pass other legislative hurdles before it becomes law. HR 699 has been supported by those with diverse backgrounds and political ideologies who have come together to reform expansive governmental surveillance power.  </p>

<p>HR 699 was passed with the background of an ongoing intelligence scandal related to the revelations surrounding the National Security Agency (NSA) <a href="/feature/featured/prism/">surveillance programs</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which have sparked worldwide debate and concern over citizens' privacy. Last year, current and former <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/nsa-now-collecting-less-than-30-percent-of-us-phone-records.php">US officials released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that less than 30 percent of all Americans' phone records are being collected due to the inability to keep up with the increased use of cellular phones</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/">Constitutional Court of Colombia</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday legalized same-sex marriage. In a <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/matrimonio-gay-corte-constitucional-le-daria-el-si-definitivo/16575865">6-3 decision</a> [<em>El Tiempo</em> report, in Spanish], the court found that same-sex marriage does not violate the country's <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Colombia_2013?lang=en">constitution</a> [text]. The decision comes just weeks after the court dismissed a petition for equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. Under the ruling, state officials must allow same-sex couples to marry, and about 70 unions previously registered as civil partnerships will now automatically be <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-29/colombia-legalises-same-sex-marriage/7371962">converted to marriages</a> [AFP report].</p>

<p>Thursday's ruling makes Colombia the fourth country to legalize same-sex marriage. <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Argentina</a> became the first in 2010, followed by <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Uruguay</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/brazil-justice-council-effectively-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Brazil</a> [JURIST reports] in 2013. Same-sex marriage is also legal in much of Mexico, and the country's top court has ruled that state same-sex marriage bans are <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/mexico-top-court-finds-same-sex-marriage-bans-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Colombia's Constitutional Court had ruled in November that same-sex couples may legally <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">adopt children</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/frcr16_8mad.pdf">rule change</a> [order, PDF] Thursday that would permit US judges to issue search warrants granting access to computers in any jurisdiction. Chief Justice John Roberts sent the changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to Congress, which has until December 1 to approve, reject or amend the rule. Under the current rules, judges are typically restricted to issuing search warrants within their jurisdiction. The rule change would allow judges to grant search warrants to law enforcement when the computer's location is unknown. Civil liberty groups <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-warrants-highcourt-idUSKCN0XP2XU">oppose the rule change</a> [Reuters report], arguing that it will expand the FBI's hacking authority, threatening Americans' privacy. They also believe individuals will be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures. Officials are defending the rule, arguing it it necessary to adapt with changing technologies. They ensure that the rule change will not authorize any new authorities not already permitted under the current law. </p>

<p>The rule change seeking to broaden warrant jurisdiction has recently been overshadowed by other challenges the government has faced with digital information. The government's authority to compel companies like Apple to aid them in accessing devices has been a large issue. In March the <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] dropped its <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-drops-case-against-apple-aftering-unlocking-iphone.php">case</a> [JURIST report] seeking to compel Apple to assist unlocking the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone, saying the DOJ has accessed the data itself. The DOJ stated that they may have another method to unlock the shooter's phone and therefore would not need Apple to comply with the order. At the end of February Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-files-objections-to-order-to-unlock-iphone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a brief in the US District Court for the Central District of California in opposition of the US government's request for the company to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook. Counsel for Apple called the case "unprecedented" after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-motion-to-compel-apple-to-unlock-shooters-phone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a motion to compel Apple to unlock the encrypted iPhone. In response to the legal conflict, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-asks-congress-to-create-expert-panel-on-privacy-issues.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US government to create a panel of experts to discuss issues of security versus privacy. These developments came after Apple refused the initial court order to assist the government in unlocking the iPhone from one of the San Bernardino shooter. The court order <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-magistrate-orders-apple-to-assist-us-government-in-unlocking-individuals-phone.php">required</a> [JURIST report] Apple to supply software to the FBI to disable a self-destruct feature that erases phone data after 10 failed attempts to enter the phone's password.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Order-on-Veasey-stay-request-4-29-15.pdf">refused to block</a> [order, PDF] Texas from enforcing its controversial voter identification law. Plaintiffs had <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/voters-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">filed an application</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court last month, asking the court to vacate a stay that allowed the voter ID law to remain in place. The issue is currently <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">pending before</a> [JURIST report] the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, but challengers had sought to block the law's enforcement in the interim. The Supreme Court did indicate that it might reconsider the issue if it is not resolved before the upcoming November election:<blockquote>The Court recognizes the time constraints the parties confront in light of the scheduled elections in November, 2016. If, on or before July 20, 2016, the Court of Appeals has neither issued an opinion on the merits of the case nor issued an order vacating or modifying the current stay order, an aggrieved party may seek interim relief from this Court by filing an appropriate application.</blockquote>The controversial Texas law was approved five years ago and has been in effect for three elections.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Earlier this week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. Earlier this month a federal appeals court held that a Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. Last year the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lets-wisconsin-voter-id-law-stand.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-803.htm">Frank v. Walker</a> [docket], allowing Wisconsin's voter ID law to stand. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The North Gauteng High Court in South Africa on Friday <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2016/255.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] that the 2009 decision to discontinue the prosecution of <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=7">President Jacob Zuma</a> [official profile] on 783 corruption charges be set aside, and that Zuma and his codefendants pay the full costs of the ligation brought forth by an opposing political party, <a href="https://www.da.org.za">Democratic Alliance</a> (DA) [party website]. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/29/south-african-court-says-embattled-president-must-face-corruption-case/">court stated</a> [WP report] that the prosecutor, Mokotedi Mpshe, was pressured to discontinue the prosecution in 2009, made an irrational decision and ignored the oath of his office, which demanded he act with independence. The court also found that when Mpshe announced the decision, he failed to consult with the senior members of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to express their views on the matter. This failure was considered especially noteworthy because up until March 31, 2009, there was consensus in the NPA that prosecution must continue. However, the very next day Mpshe announced his decision to drop the prosecution. According to the court findings, some of the other members of the NPA were not even informed of the decision until April 6. Furthermore, the court found that Mpshe did not allow the Director of Public Prosecution, Kwa Zulu Natal, to listen to recordings of phone conversations, which were crucial evidence in the case. This was especially puzzling to the court considering the fact that it was Natal who signed the indictment and authorized Zuma's prosecution. The NPA will now have to decide whether to reinstate the charges, but it is not entirely clear if it will do so considering the court's finding that NPA's prosecution of the case is heavily politicized. </p>

<p>The South African president has been embroiled in legal trouble for the past several months. Zuma <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-president-zuma-beats-impeachment.php">evaded impeachment</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month after the African National Congress (ANC) [official website] reaffirmed its support for the president. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last month that he had ignored the order of the Public Protector to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence. Zuma has been at the center of political controversy for years. Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but he was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">acquitted and reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as African National Congress deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">November 2007 decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [office website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19900&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] all parties to disengage from all-out war in Syria, expressing deep concern over a "monstrous disregard for civilian lives." Reports of civilian deaths and injures stemming from bombings of marketplaces and medical facilities have been increasing, and Zeid said such attacks may amount to war crimes. Zeid stated that the violence is soaring back to the levels seen prior to the cessation of hostilities and many citizens remaining in this area are in grave danger. He said, &#8220;Urgent action is needed by all relevant actors to ensure the protection of civilians and their right to life, and to fight the impunity that has done so much to encourage the multitude of horrendous breaches of international humanitarian law and international human rights law that have taken place in Syria over the past five years."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In February the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-syria-systematically-exterminating-detainees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government is systematically exterminating detainees. In November <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php">hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity. In October France opened a torture <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/france-opens-torture-inquiry-into-syria-government-under-assad.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of the Syrian government under Assad in detention facilities. Additionally, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-us-allies-in-syria-committing-war-crimes.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in October detailing the possibility of war crimes in Syria. The AI report criticized the Syrian government by stating that "they have maintained unlawful sieges, restricted humanitarian assistance deliveries, deliberately attacked civilians, and carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, arbitrary detentions, abductions and enforced disappearances."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="http://www.centcom.mil/">Central Command</a> [official website] released its final <a href="https://www6.centcom.mil/foia_rr/FOIA_RR.asp?Path=/5%20USC%20552%28a%29%282%29%28D%29Records&Folder=1.%20Airstrike%20on%20the%20MSF%20Trauma%20Center%20in%20Kunduz%20Afghanistan%20-%203%20Oct%202015">report</a> [materials] Friday on the October airstrike that hit a <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (MSF) [advocacy website] hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, finding that the strike was not a war crime. The investigation concluded that the gunship's ground crew and operators were not aware they were firing on a medical facility. Because there was no intent to fire upon a medical facility, there was no war crime, the report concluded. US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter expressed his condolences in <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/746216/statement-by-secretary-of-defense-ash-carter-on-the-kunduz-investigation-report">remarks</a> [press release] Friday and sent a <a href="http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/SD-ROE-Guidance-post-Kunduz.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] directing specific actions to prevent future incidents. Sixteen individuals are reportedly <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/hospital-bombing-afghanistan-war-crime-pentagon/story?id=38762019">facing discipline</a> [AP report] for their roles in the attack. MSF said it will <a href="http://www.msf.org/en/article/kunduz-initial-reaction-public-release-us-military-investigative-report-attack-msf-trauma">review the report</a> [press release] and reiterated calls for an independent investigation.</p>

<p>Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/pentagon-determines-human-error-caused-afghanistan-hospital-bombing.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing in November and announced that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error." Commander of US forces in Afghanistan <a href="http://www.rs.nato.int/about-isaf/leadership/general-john-f.-campbell.html">General John Campbell</a> [official profile] stated that the hospital was targeted accidentally, and US personnel believed they were attacking a separate structure containing enemy combatants several hundred meters away. The investigation found that personnel did not complete full precautionary measures to verify the target was a "legitimate military target." Systems and procedural failures compounded the human error, resulting in the hospital bombing that killed more than 30 and injured dozens. MSF <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/doctors-without-borders-seeks-investigation-into-us-bombing-of-afghan-hospital.php">called for an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the attack by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights also <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-kunduz-clinic-airstrikes.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Kunduz hospital attack and for the results of an investigation to be made public. Several days prior to the hospital attack, the UN rights leader also requested that all parties in the Taliban attack in Kunduz <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-afghanistan-attack-to-protect-civilians.php">attempt to keep civilians out of harm</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reinhold Hanning, a 94-year-old former Schutzstaffel (SS) guard in the Auschwitz death camp between 1942 and 1944, apologized to Nazi victims at his trial in Detmold, a small town in West Germany. Hanning, who is accused of being an accessory to the murder of at least 170,000 people at the camp, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36168688">stated</a> [BBC report] that he is "ashamed" of his work in the "criminal organization." He admitted that he knew what was going on at the camp and that he took no efforts to stop it, but he denied his participation in the murders. This was the first time Hanning had spoken openly about his role in Auschwitz. According to a 22-page declaration submitted to court, Hanning voluntarily joined the SS in 1940 when he was 18 years old at the urging of his stepmother. He was sent to Auschwitz after he was wounded and had his requests to return to the battlefield rejected. His declaration further stated: "People were shot, gassed and burned. I could see how corpses were taken back and forth or moved out. I could smell the burning bodies; I knew corpses were being burned ..." Auschwitz survivor and co-plaintiff, 94-year-old Leon Schwarzbaum, stated that Hanning's apology was not enough. According to prosecutors, Hanning met Jewish prisoners as they arrived at the camp and may have escorted some of them to the gas chambers. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/former-auschwitz-guard-goes-on-trial-in-germany.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that these gas chambers could only function with guards like Hanning. A verdict is expected in May, but experts say that Hanning is unlikely to serve a prison sentence because of his age and the length of the appeals process.</p>

<p>German courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/germany-court-rules-accused-auschwitz-paramedic-fit-for-trial.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of a 95-year-old Auschwitz paramedic accused of being an accessory to the murder of 3,681 people at Auschwitz. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">2011 conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. The most recent person imprisoned for their role in the Holocaust was Oskar Groening. Known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," Groening was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in September 2014 as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. In July Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he said he would <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court of North Korea on Friday sentenced US citizen, Kim Dong-chul, to 10 years in prison and hard labor on charges of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/29/476132215/north-korean-court-sentences-american-to-prison-term">subversion and espionage</a> [NPR report]. Kim, 62, was a resident of Virginia before moving to China for business in 2001. He was living close to the North Korean boarder when he was detained in October. Kim was allegedly arrested while trying to receive a USB drive containing national secrets. He was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/11/asia/north-korea-alleged-us-detainee/">interviewed </a> [text] by CNN in January where he called upon the US and South Korea for help. He also gave a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35898116">press conference</a> [BBC report] in March, in which he appears to confess to the charges. The validity of his confession has been subject to speculation. </p>

<p>Kim is the second American sentenced in North Korea this year. In March a University of Virginia student, Otto Warmbier, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-korea-high-court-sentences-us-student-to-15-years-hard-labor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 15 years of imprisonment and hard labor following his conviction for subversion. Warmbier, 21, was in North Korea as part of a tour group when he was arrested before boarding a plane out of the country. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5KTVaU-iXc">confessed</a> [video] in February in a press conference that he had attempted to steal a propaganda sign from a Pyongyang hotel, calling his crime "very severe and pre-planned." He was accused of attempting to impair the unity of North Korea's people, and was charged with subversion under Article 60 of the country's criminal code. Warmbier was reportedly convicted this week after a trial at the North Korean Supreme Court in Pyongyang which lasted only one hour.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai police confirmed Saturday that eight people have been <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-politics-idUKKCN0XQ0YT">charged</a> [Reuters report] with sedition and computer crimes in relation to Facebook posts in opposition of the government. The activists were detained on Wednesday for comments concerning Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15639418">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] and criticisms of the controversial <a href="http://www.parliament.go.th/ewtcommittee/ewt/draftconstitution2/ewt_dl_link.php?nid=304&filename=index">draft constitution</a> [text, PDF, in Thai]. Two of the activists are charged in violation of the Royal Defamation law. Shortly before the arrests were made, the Thai government effectuated a new law making it illegal to forcefully criticize the constitution. </p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over Thailand's governmental impunity since it became a military junta in May 2014. Earlier this month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19859&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release]  regarding the expanding role which the Thai military is playing in the civilian administration. Thailand will soon vote on a final draft of their constitution, and a new law places limits on advocating for or against the constitution which has led to the arrests of several human rights activists. This same month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and several other rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged </a>[JURIST report] Thailand to repeal <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-military-granted-police-powers.php">Order Number 13/2016</a> [JURIST report], expressing concern that it will worsen human rights conditions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.gdb-pur.com/">Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico</a> (GDB) [official website] <a href="http://www.gdb-pur.com/documents/GDBPressReleaseCoopertivasFinal.pdf">announced its agreement</a> [press release, PDF] with various state chartered credit unions in Puerto Rico whereby the maturity date of approximately $33 million of notes issued in a limited private exchange will be extended by one year to May 1, 2017. According to GDB's statement the private exchange was originally established to address the "unique financial considerations" of the credit unions, and apart from this agreement, GDB was still negotiating a deal with other creditors to avoid a default on <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-bank-idUSKCN0XQ2OE">another $422 million due</a> [Reuters report] on Monday. GDB's statement further stated it is continuing its efforts to strike a deal on a transaction related to an exchange of all of GDB's bond indebtedness totaling approximately $4 billion, which would require the participation of all of GDB's creditors including the credit unions. However, this particular agreement does not affect those ongoing negotiations. GDB has also been negotiating with hedge funds such as Fir Tree, Solus and Claren Road to prevent a default that has the potential to worsen Puerto Rico's recession. The notes here were initially expected to mature on Sunday, but the new agreement has given GDB a breathing space of one year to get its act together. However, Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla stated that &#8220;there will be a default on Monday" in connection with the other payments coming due. Any default here is likely to pressure Congress to intervene but federal lawmakers disagree on whether to put Puerto Rico's finances under federal oversight.</p>

<p>Puerto Rico has been in a state of economic and social crisis characterized by a decade-long recession, 45 percent poverty rate and shrinking population. The Puerto Rico legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/puerto-rico-legislature-approve-bill-for-fiscal-emergency.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that would allow the island territory to enter into a state of fiscal emergency and begin the negotiation process toward a one-year debt moratorium. That <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/Documents/Measures/7c856cb0-7ac2-495a-8a29-b12c13edbe2f.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] was primarily and directly concerned with paving the way for the above-mentioned debt deals. At the end of 2015, Puerto Rico was $70 billion dollars in debt. The governor previously anticipated a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-28/which-puerto-rico-bond-defaults-next-42-yields-provide-a-clue">government default</a> [Bloomberg report] in 2016, which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/business/dealbook/puerto-rico-defaults-on-debt-payments.html?_r=1">came to fruition</a> [NYT report] on January 4. The territory has been suffering from a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35368786">massive recession</a> [BBC report] since 2006, nearly a decade before Padilla announced that Puerto Rico was unable to pay its debts. However, the Puerto Rico Electronic Power Authority, a major player in the economic crisis, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-24/puerto-rico-electric-wins-debt-restructuring-deal-with-creditors">reached a deal</a> [Bloomberg report] to restructure its debt in December. This deal is the first of many restructuring plans to alleviate the government's debt. In February, the Puerto Rico Legislature <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/Documents/Measures/66728140-f770-48c7-bb47-660163e60d49.pdf">passed a bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] that would restructure the island's debt, which was then <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/puerto-rico-could-pass-debt-restructuring-bill.php">estimated to be $9 billion</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Tyler <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/30/louisiana-prisoner-freed-after-41-years-of-controversial-sentence">was released</a> [Guardian report] from Louisiana's notorious Angola prison on Saturday after serving 41 years of an unconstitutional life sentence for the death of a white high school student resulting from a racially charged confrontation. Tyler spent eight years of his sentence in solitary confinement in Angola, a prison known for harboring racial tensions and considered among the toughest of the state's prisons. This development comes in the wake of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-280_3204.pdf">Supreme Court ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in January that the unconstitutionality of a life without parole sentence for juvenile offenders is to be applied retroactively. This ruling essentially gave prosecutors a legal avenue to reduce Tyler's sentence with a guilty plea on Friday. Tyler was only 16 years old when he was convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury in Southern Louisiana in 1974 for the death of 13-year-old Thomas Weber. The incident occurred as Tyler was passing through an unruly crowd of white students on a bus filled with black students. Police found a gun on the bus and Tyler was charged with capital murder and tried as an adult. At the time, Tyler was the youngest person on Louisiana's death row. Afterward, some of the testifying students recanted their stories, but Tyler never received a new trial despite the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal's</a> [official website] recognition that his conviction was "fundamentally unfair." Tyler's death sentence was commuted to life in prison after the state's mandatory death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1976. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that a landmark decision banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles should apply retroactively. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">banned life without parole sentences for juveniles</a> [JURIST report] in 2012, but until now that outcome was being applied only prospectively in many states. The case to apply the ruling retroactively was made by <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=profile.biography&personid=20315">Bryan Stevenson</a> [NYU profile], professor at New York University, and executive director of <a href="http://www.eji.org/">Equal Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy website]. The case involved Henry Montgomery, convicted in 1963 of murdering a deputy sheriff at the age of 17. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. At age of 70, his case came before the Supreme Court with Stevenson's team arguing on his behalf to apply the ruling in 2012 retroactively to his 1963 life sentence. In a 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court concluded that "prisoners like Montgomery must be given the opportunity to show their crime did not reflect irreparable corruption; and, if it did not, their hope for some years of life outside prison walls must be restored." Tyler's release is among the first set of what now appears be a long line of juvenile life without parole sentences that will be set aside as a consequence of the Supreme Court ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Supporters of Brazilian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rouseff</a> [BBC profile] on Sunday plan to rally in support of the President, who is facing a Senate impeachment trial. The supporters plan to decry the President's potential impeachment. The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies voted for impeachment by the required two-thirds majority, splitting 367 to 137. The matter now moves to the upper house, whose 81 members will vote by simple majority whether to hold a trial. That vote is expected in May.</p>

<p>In early April 2015, the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-denies-presidents-last-attempt-to-avoid-impeachment.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the president's request for an injunction to suspend the impeachment vote. Previously the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer. In December the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on two measures to set the stage for impeachment proceedings against Rousseff: one requiring the re-formation of a congressional committee set up to guide Rousseff's impeachment through Congress, and the other giving the Senate power to review a lower house vote for impeachment. Rousseff's opposition <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/ht/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval. Rousseff argued that the opposition is trying to impeach her to hinder government actions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A member of the US Navy, on Friday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-navy-captain-select-sentenced-over-six-years-prison-accepting-cash-and-prostitutes">admitted</a> [press release] to accepting cash and other bribes in exchange for providing classified navy information to the defense contractor Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd (GDMA), based in Singapore. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz, age 49, was sentenced to 78 months in prison for accepting cash, gifts, travel expenses, entertainment and the services of prostitutes from GDMA. In addition to his prison term he was to pay a 100,000 USD fine. </p>

<p>In 2014, Congress <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/31/navy-secretary-to-brief-congress-on-bribery-probe/">began looking into the Navy bribery scandal</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] with the large Singapore defense contractor. To date, 9 individuals have pleaded guilty to their involvement in the bribery scheme and 10 have been charged in the investigation by Congress.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day after storming parliament, Iraqi protesters are <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/protesters-storm-baghdad-green-zone-parliament-160430120004964.html">camping out</a> [<em>Aljazeera</em> report] Sunday within the confines of Baghdad's International Zone, also referred to as the "Green Zone." The Green Zone is a secured area that includes embassies and government buildings. The Green Zone was initially breached on Sunday by protesters. Many of the activists are followers of Shiite cleric <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/moqtada-al-sadr-iraqs-powerful-unpredictable-cleric-194654677.html">Muqtada al-Sadr</a> [AP profile]. A state of emergency was declared for the city and the Iraqi Prime Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28748366">Haider al-Abadi</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iraqi-prime-minister-orders-arrest-of-troublemaking-protesters/2016/05/01/e6e4d070-0f24-11e6-bc53-db634ca94a2a_story.html">demanded arrests</a> [WP report]. The demonstration was made in opposition of alleged corruption within the Iraqi government. Muqtada al-Sadr has called on the government to change on the terms of a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36180184">non-partisan, technocratic make-up</a> [BBC report]. Protesters are voicing their concern about the substantial delays facing the government reforms. There have been <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_IRAQ?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-04-30-08-23-39">reports</a> [AP report] of demonstrators beginning to leave the Green Zone on Sunday afternoon, after al-Sadr requested the protests break-up to maintain security for pilgrims expected to enter the city to visit the shrine of Imam Musa Kadhim.</p>

<p>This weekend's demonstrations in Iraq was the culmination of weeks of political unrest in Iraq. In April people began <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/protesters-in-baghdad-demand-new-government-amid-political-reforms.php">protesting in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] demanding a new government amid the third cancellation of a session of parliament in one week as officials discussed political reforms. The particular session of parliament was cancelled because the chambers could not <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/iraq-political-crisis-160416105131271.html">be secured</a> [Aljazeera report] by security as tempers flared. The political turmoil has been the result of a plan by Haider al-Abadi to bring technocrats into the cabinet to challenge corruption. On March 31, al-Abadi presented a potential list of individuals, but then shortly thereafter drafted a second list that was more aligned with political motives. Many MP's then staged a sit-in protest of this move, as they believed it would allow corruption to continue. Iraq has faced significant challenges in recent years with providing basic infrastructure and a stable government. Earlier that week, members of parliament <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/iraq-mps-vote-parliamentary-speaker-row-heats-160414112239485.html">voted to remove</a> [Aljazeera report] the parliamentary speaker Salim al-Juburi after accusing him of blocking anti-corruption reforms. In August Iraq's cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/iraq-cabinet-approves-measures-to-reduce-top-positions-fight-corruption.php">approved a proposal</a> [JURIST report] by al-Abadi to reduce the number of top political positions, decrease spending, and restart a corruption investigation program. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Envoy for Yemen <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sga1563.doc.htm">Ismail Ould Cheik Ahmed</a> [UN bio] <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OSESGY/posts/1021021784646453">announced</a> [press release] Saturday that peace negotiations between Yemeni parties in Kuwait were off to an "encouraging start that will set the ground for a negotiated solution." Both the Government of Yemen and the delegation of Ansarullah and the General People's Congress have presented plans for restoration of peace, including proposals for security and political stability throughout the next phase of negotiations. He stressed that all parties have expressed a commitment to <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11859.doc.htm">UN Security Council Resolution 2216 (2015)</a> [UN report] which imposes sanctions on "individuals it said were undermining the stability of Yemen." The UN envoy also said "[t]he session went on in a positive and constructive atmosphere." He commended both parties for their determination to come to a resolution, but acknowledged that there is much work still to be done. The envoy also recognized violations resulting in civilian casualties and offered condolences to the families.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. In March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-yemen-conflict-to-swallow-their-pride.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Saudi Arabian coalition forces in Yemen for the more than 3,000 civilian casualties resulting from the conflict in just the past year. Also in March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the civilian death toll in Yemen had reached nearly 2,800. In January the UN World Food Programme appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to allow the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php">safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into possible war crimes surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Army Court of Criminal Appeals has <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/05/01/62denial.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the lawyers for US Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl should be allowed access to classified materials. In an opinion made public Saturday, the three-judge court upheld the military judge's issuance of a protective order and access order against claims by the prosecution that the lower court erred in allowing unauthorized disclosure of and unfettered access to classified information. The court found that "neither the military judge's Access Order nor his Protective Order 'direct the disclosure of classified information' which has not been subject to a reasonable opportunity to review for potential assertion of government privilege." More specifically, the court stated that this national security check had not been diminished, as the government may still claim that disclosure of certain classified materials is harmful and should not be released. The court also stated that defense counsel must "meet the requirements of federal law, executive orders, and policies to access classified information" and were thus not unfettered in their access.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-27673631">Sergeant Bergdahl</a> [BBC profile] is currently facing a court martial for desertion and endangering fellow troops after he left his post in 2009 and is potentially facing a life sentence. Bergdahl's actions in 2009 resulted in a huge manhunt in Afghanistan, which ultimately led to his capture by the Taliban's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/07/world/who-is-haqqani/">Haqqani Network</a> [CNN backgrounder] insurgents in June 2009. Bergdahl was imprisoned for nearly five years in eastern Afghanistan. During the time he was held as prisoner, Bergdahl <a href="http://supportbowe.org/brief-narrative/bowe-bergdahl-videos/">appeared in six videos</a> [advocacy website] released by the Taliban, the only indication that he was still alive. In March of last year the US military <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/former-pow-and-us-military-sergeant-charged-with-desertion-misbehavior.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Bergdahl with "desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty" and "misbehavior before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command, unit, or place." Bergdahl was <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/final-known-us-prisoner-of-war-released-in-exchange-for-guantanamo-detainees.php">exchanged</a> [JURIST report] in 2014 for five Taliban members who were held at the Guantanamo Bay detention complex.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-361_db8e.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ocasio-v-united-states/">Ocasio v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a defendant may be convicted of conspiring to violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1951">Hobbs Act</a> [text] based on proof that he reached an agreement with the owner of the property in question to obtain that property under color of official right. The case raised the issue of whether the petitioner could have been convicted under the Hobbes Act upon evidence that he had received money from members within a conspiracy, not from those outside a conspiracy. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the court reasoned that it is sufficient to satisfy the elements of the Hobbes Act if the conspirator agreed that the underlying crime be committed by a member of the conspiracy capable of committing it even if the actions were not completed by the officer. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a concurring opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts. </p>

<p>Samuel Ocasio, a former Baltimore Police Officer, entered into a deal with Majestic Auto Repair Shop in 2009 under which he would encourage those involved in an automobile accident to send their damaged vehicles to Majestic. Ocasio would receive monetary compensation for his recommendation, and Majestic's client-base increased to the point where 90 percent of their business stemmed from this agreement. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-to-hear-extortion-and-spousal-guarantors-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in March of last year and <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-conspiracies-and-applying-state-law-to-arbitration-agreements.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's Ministry of External Affairs said Monday that India will allow detained Italian marine Salvatore Girone to return home. The statement came after Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/sala_stampa/archivionotizie/comunicati/2016/05/fucilieri-di-marina-decisione-tribunale.html">announced</a> [press release, in Italian] that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague had <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/web/view/117">ordered</a> [case materials] Girone's return. Girone, one of two Italian marines held in India for their part in the killing of two Indian fisherman in 2012, will be allowed to return to Italy pending the adjudication of the case. According to the Italian government, the PCA reasoned that Girone could be detained in India for several years with no formal criminal charges pending the decision over which country has jurisdiction over the case, potentially violating his human rights. The Indian government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-india-return-idUSKCN0XT1EF">noted</a> [Reuters] that the PCA confirmed Italy's obligation to return Girone to India if it is found that India has jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p>The "Enrica Lexie Incident" took place in 2012 when two Italian marines, Girone and  Massimiliano Latorre, <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-fishermen-killing-italian-ship-enrica-lexie-sails-off-kerala-waters-1684893">shot and killed two Indian fishermen</a> [DNA India report], Ajesh Binki and Valentine, believing them to be pirates. The killing sparked international controversy and jurisdictional issues. Last year 2015 the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea<a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.24_prov_meas/C24_Order_24.08.2015_orig_Eng.pdf">ordered India</a> [order, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/tribunal-orders-india-to-suspend-trial-of-italy-marines.php">suspend the trial</a> [JURIST report] of the two Italian marines. In July <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-italy-marines-idUSKCN0PN1MK20150713">India's top court heard</a> [Reuters report] a plea from Italy challenging India's jurisdiction. In 2012 Rome compensated the victims' families with $190,000, and the families dropped their cases against the marines, but the state did not follow suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case deals with designs on cheerleader uniforms, but the case is expected to have a broader impact. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/15a0194p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Varsity Brand's designs were copyrightable.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/1jd/supctmanh/chambers_information.shtml">Justice Arthur Engoron</a> [official profile] on Monday ruled that New York election officials may certify the recent primary election results after rejecting a challenge to the state's "closed primary" system. New York attorney Mark Warren Moody sued the city and state election officials claiming millions of state citizens were barred from voting because they did not change their party affiliations by October 2015. Moody argued that the October deadline was a large hindrance on the ability of voters to participate in the recent primary. Moody reportedly <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-rejects-challenge-new-york-closed-primary-system-article-1.2622021">accepted</a> [<em>New York Daily News</em> report] the judge's decision as fair but urged for the issue to be resolved in the future. </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US, particularly during this election season. Last week an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/arizona-judge-dismisses-voter-fraud-complaint.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] alleging fraud during the primary elections. The US Department of Justice had previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/doj-investigating-voting-issues-in-arizona-primary.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] Maricopa County, Arizona, officials that it would investigate the issues voters in Arizona's most populous county faced during the March 22 primary election. Earlier in March an Ohio judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-judge-allows-some-17-year-olds-may-vote-in-primaries.php">granted an emergency order</a> [JURIST report] allowing 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November general election to vote in the Ohio primary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Argentinian federal prosecutor on Monday made a formal request to a judge to conduct an investigation of former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12284208">Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner</a> [BBC profile] and her son for illegal enrichment. Federal prosecutor Carlos Rivolo has been overseeing an ongoing investigation into a real estate company run by the former president and her son that has ties to two businessmen who have been accused of tax evasion and money laundering. The real estate company was <a href="https://www.ksl.com/?nid=151&sid=39613075&title=argentina-prosecutor-asks-probe-of-ex-president-and-son">linked to the illegal enrichment charges</a> [AP report] by renting properties from one of the businessmen who has been formally charged. The entire investigation was launched after a legislator reported the alleged corruption.  </p>

<p>Last year a judge in Argentina dismissed criminal allegations against Kirchner that accused her of conspiring to shield Iranian officials from responsibility for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Kirchner was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/argentina-president-accused-of-cover-up-in-terrorist-attack.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of the cover up in January 2015. An appeals court in Argentina ruled in May 2014 that a controversial agreement between Argentina and Iran to investigate the 1994 bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/argentina-court-strikes-down-agreement-to-investigate-1994-bombing-of-jewish-community.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The two nations <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/argentina-iran-create-commission-to-investigate-1994-community-center-bombing.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the agreement in January 2013, which permitted Argentine authorities to question the Iranian suspects under Interpol arrest warrants, but only in Tehran. In 2005 Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/argentina-admits-failure-in-jewish.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] formal responsibility for its failure to discover who was behind the 1994 bombing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three UN human rights experts on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19917&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] action to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, saying it iis "[n]ot just about water, but human rights." The experts on extreme poverty, housing, and water and sanitation touched on how the water crisis was the result of "failing to recognize that water is a human right, from failing to ensure that essential services are provided in a non-discriminatory manner, and from treating those who live in poverty in ways that exacerbate their plight." US President Barack Obama is expected to visit Flint on May 4, and the experts called this an opportunity for him to address the crisis and "show global leadership." They also discussed issues of race and poverty, noting how if the population had been "well-off or overwhelmingly white" the water crisis might have been handled in a more responsible manner as there is a strong connection between clean water supply and poverty.</p>

<p>Public officials have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/what-did-the-governor-know-about-flints-water-and-when-did-he-know-it/423342/">come under fire</a> [Atlantic report] for their response to the crisis, as it took 20 months after the initial switch in water supply for an emergency to be declared by the state. Last month David Leyton, a prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, announced that a Michigan judge will <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/officials-facing-criminal-charges-over-flint-water-crisis.php">allow criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against three people involved in the water crisis in Flint, including the man who supervised the treatment plan as well as two state environmental officials. Also last month the city of Flint filed an <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/city-of-flint-files-intent-to-sue-letter-with-state-no-suit-yet.php">intent to sue letter</a> [JURIST report] with the state, claiming that the city lacks funds to defend itself against lawsuits filed during the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/health/flint-water-crisis-timeline/">water crisis</a> [CNN timeline]. In March a Michigan firm <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-flint-children-exposed-to-water.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the children of Flint. Earlier in March seven families living in Flint filed a <a href="https://dlbjbjzgnk95t.cloudfront.net/0768000/768552/flint%20suit.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Michigan Governor Rick Snyder alleging <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">gross negligence</a> [JURIST report] in connection to the lead-contaminated water. Also in March a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-experts-urge-us-to-address-michigan-water-contamination.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its efforts to address the issue of lead-contaminated water in Flint. In January the Natural Resources Defense Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-replace-lead-pipes-in-flint-michigan.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, seeking the replacement of lead water pipes in the city of Flint. Also in January Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/michigan-ag-appoints-former-prosecutor-to-investigate-flint-water-crisis.php">appointed a former prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] to act as Special Counsel in his investigation into the water contamination crisis in the city of Flint, and a retired Detroit FBI chief will also participate in the investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four men were arrested Monday in connection with the murder of Berta Cáceres, the founder of the <a href="https://copinh.org">Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations Honduras</a> (COPINH) [advocacy website, in Spanish] and a prominent defender of indigenous rights and the environment. The men were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/world/americas/honduras-arrests-4-men-in-killing-of-berta-caceres.html?_r=0">arrested</a> [NYT report] in raids as part of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/02/476525879/4-arrested-in-murder-of-honduran-activist-berta-c-ceres">"Jaguar" operation</a> [NPR report]. UN rights experts had <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-reiterate-call-for-honduras-to-protect-human-rights-defenders.php">called</a> [JURIST report] last month for Honduras to provide justice for Cáceres, as well as broad protection for everyone defending human rights and the environment. Cáceres was killed at the beginning of March.</p>

<p>The experts welcomed the arrest of a suspect in the murder of another COPINH leader, Nelson García, which occurred less than two weeks after the murder of Cáceres. After the death of García, UN experts called for the protection of human rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-honduras-must-protect-human-rights-defenders.php">defenders</a> [JURIST report]. However, Honduras has been experiencing unrest throughout the country for some time now. Last November a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-urges-honduras-to-increase-efforts-to-curb-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Honduras to address internal displacement caused by organized gang violence and a failing criminal justice system. UN human rights expert Victoria Tauli-Corpuz <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-raises-concerns-about-indigenous-people-of-honduras.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the situation faced by the indigenous people of Honduras, specifically in connection with their land and natural resource rights, their lack of access to justice, education and health, and the general environment of violence and impunity affecting their communities. In October Honduran Congressional Vice President Lena Gutierrez <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-raises-concerns-about-indigenous-people-of-honduras.php">began her trial </a>[JURIST report] for her role in the nation's recent medical sale scandal. The charges include falsification of public documents and fraud against the government by drug sales to the Ministry of Health. In June 2015 thousands of <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/protesters-call-for-resignation-of-honduras-president-on-corruption-allegations.php">protesters marched</a> [JURIST report] in Honduras on calling for the resignation of President Juan Hernandez and demanding an independent investigation into his role in an ongoing corruption scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/Judgment%20part%202/ICT%2001%20of%202015%20(Judgment).pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF] four men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. Five men were tried, but only four received death sentences for crimes against humanity as enumerated in <a href="https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat.nsf/0/0618daaa2660e9b3c125771a00264b13/$FILE/International%20Crimes%20(Tribunals)%20Act,%201973%20(as%20amended%20in%202009).pdf">section 3(2)(a)(g)(h) of the Act No. XIX of 1973</a> [text, PDF]. The fifth was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-war-crimes-court-sentences-death-38834994">sentenced to life in prison</a> [AP report] on murder charges. Only one of the four sentenced to death was in court Tuesday; the other three remain at large. The men have 30 days to appeal their convictions.</p>

<p>The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." In March the Supreme Court of Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence of a former opposition politician for allegedly committing war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. In February the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-2-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. Last June a Bangladeshi court gave Syed Mohammed Hasan Ali, a fugitive commander of an auxiliary force of Pakistani troops, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-fugitive-commander-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for torture and massacre in the Liberation War. In April of last year a Bangladeshi appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/bangladesh-appeals-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-convicted-war-criminal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a final appeal by Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, an Islamist party official convicted of war crimes during the 1971 Liberation war, upholding his death sentence. In February 2015 the ICTB convicted and <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/former-bangladesh-lawmaker-sentenced-to-life-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Abdul Jabbar, a militia leader and former lawmaker, to life in prison for genocide and religious persecution committed during the 1971 Liberation War. Earlier that month the tribunal also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bangladesh-islamist-leader-sentenced-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Islamist leader Adbus Subhan to death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Georgia <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2016-05-03/deal-issues-2016-veto-statements">vetoed</a> [veto statements] a <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20152016/HB/859">bill</a> [materials] that would have allowed the concealed carrying of handguns on college campuses. The bill, if approved, would have allowed anyone 21 or older with a concealed carry permit to have a concealed handgun on a college campus, adding an exception to the prohibition of possessing a weapon in a school zone. The governor in his statement said that it would be wrong to conclude that applying certain restrictions to the Second Amendment right to bear arms was unconstitutional, citing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [JURIST report] recognizing schools and government buildings as "sensitive places."  He further stated that the concept of college campuses being gun free zones was a deep rooted one within the state. The governor had previously <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/deadline-arrives-georgia-governor-campus-guns-bill-38834139">requested</a> [AP report] follow up bills regarding concerns related to HB 859, such as access to day care centers, after HB 859 was passed in the legislature, but members denied the request. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial national topics, and gun awareness has risen in the wake of recent shootings across the nation. Last month Idaho Governor CL "Butch" Otter <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/idaho-governor-signs-law-allowing-permitless-concealed-carry-statewide.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill that made it legal throughout the state for Idaho residents over 21 years of age to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Earlier that week Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/virginia-governor-vetoes-gun-bills.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] two proposed bills that would eliminate restrictions on the possession of firearms in or around state office buildings. Also that month the West Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-veto-on-permitless-concealed-carry.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to override Governor Earl Ry Tomblin's veto of a bill allowing civilians 21 and over to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In December the US Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-vacates-ruling-blocking-dc-gun-law.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling that found that a DC gun law requiring a concealed carry permit outside of the home may violate the Constitution. In October Maine's revised concealed carry law <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/maine-concealed-carry-law-takes-effect-no-longer-requires-permit.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report], allowing legal gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permit. Earlier that month a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Connecticut and New York gun control legislation that ban semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Federal prosecutors in Brazil have filed a civil <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/mg/sala-de-imprensa/docs/acp-samarco">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF, in Portuguese; <a href="http://www.mpf.mp.br/mg/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-mg/mpf-entra-com-acao-para-total-reparacao-dos-danos-sociais-ambientais-e-economicos-causados-pelo-rompimento-da-barragem-da-samarco-1">press release</a>, in Portuguese] against mining companies <a href="http://www.vale.com/EN/Pages/Landing.aspx">Vale SA</a> <a href="http://www.bhpbilliton.com/">BHP Billiton Ltd.</a> [corporate websites] worth 155 billion reais (USD $43.55 billion) for a November dam collapse that killed 19 people and polluted more than 400 miles of the Rio Doce basin. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-damburst-prosecutors-idUSKCN0XU2AH">suit</a> [Reuters report] comes after a six-month investigation including both state and local governments. It follows a <a href="http://www.bhpbilliton.com/investors/news/samarco-agreement-reached-with-brazilian-authorities">settlement agreement</a> [press release] that was reached in March between the Federal Prosecutor of Brazil and <a href="http://www.samarco.com/en/">Samarco Mineração SA</a> [corporate website], a company to which both Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd. are shareholders, in which Samarco agreed to repair damage done and compensate when "remediation was not possible."</p>

<p>In January Brazil's Federal Police <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/brazil-alleges-environmental-crimes-in-investigation-into-dam-collapse.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] seven people and the three companies of environmental crimes in its probe into the major Fundão dam collapse that occurred on November 5. Brazil's Minster of Natural Environment said in November that the country's government <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/brazil-to-sue-mining-giants-for-dam-failure.php">planned to sue</a> [JURIST report] BHP Billiton Ltd., Vale SA and Samarco Mineração SA for USD $5.24 billion for damages caused by the dam collapse at an iron ore site. The Special Rapporteurs sent by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16803&amp;LangID=E">reported</a> [press release] that the "steps taken by the Brazilian government, Vale and BHP Billiton to prevent harm were clearly insufficient" and that "this disaster serves as yet another tragic example of the failure of businesses to adequately conduct human rights due diligence to prevent human rights abuses."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazilian local media reported Tuesday that the country's top prosecutors have requested an investigation into President Dilma Rousseff over alleged connections to the Petrobras corruption scandal. Though Rousseff has spoken against the accusations and threatened legal action, prosecutors claim that she attempted to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-idUSKCN0XU2FW">obstruct</a> [Reuters report] the investigation of those involved in the oil firm corruption scandal. The president <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/brazil-s-rousseff-says-pr/2756514.html">spoke</a> [Reuters report] on the probe Wednesday, saying that the call for investigation was based on lies told by former Workers Party Senator Delcidio do Amaral. Rousseff is currently facing impeachment proceedings over allegations of violating budgetary laws and is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazils-workers-party-plans-to-rally-behind-the-president-for-the-may-day-celebration.php">awaiting</a> [JURIST report] a vote by the upper house on whether an impeachment trial will be held.  </p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians including former presidents have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. In April the Supreme Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-takes-over-corruption-case-against-former-president.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that it will take over the corruption probe against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva instead of returning the case to federal Judge Serio Moro. In March a judge for the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-high-court-judge-upholds-order-barring-appointment-of-ex-president.php">upheld a ruling</a> [JURIST report] blocking the former president from taking a ministry post. Also in March, Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-supreme-court-authorizes-corruption-trial-for-presidents-rival.php">unanimously authorized</a> [JURIST report] the corruption charges against member of Congress Eduardo Cunha to proceed. Eduardo Cunha was implicated in the Petrobras scandal. Rousseff herself has been implicated in that very same scandal and has been at the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">center of impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] for months. She spoke against the accusations against her earlier this week, stating that she will take legal action against the senator who made statements against her for defamation. More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Louisiana's Senate voted 34-4 Tuesday to approve <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=229199">legislation</a> [HB 386 materials] that would extend the current 24-hour abortion waiting period to 72 hours. Supporters have hailed the legislation as an attempt to give women more time to make the decision to abort, while opponents claim it is a thinly veiled attempt to increase barriers for women seeking abortion. The bill, which has already been approved by the House, must now return to the House for final approval, but it is expected to pass. The measure would then go before Governor John Bel Edwards, who is <a href="John Bel Edwards">expected to sign it into law</a> [<em>Advocate</em> report]. If approved, the bill would make Louisiana the sixth state with a 72-hour waiting period.</p>

<p>In March the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-blocks-controversial-abortion-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana abortion law that would require abortion doctors to have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital and significant surgical upgrades to abortion centers. In a one-sentence order, the court reinstated the stay initially put in place by the <a href="http://www.lamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-allows-louisiana-to-enforce-abortion-restrictions.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official websites] in late February. Critics of the law say it is unduly burdensome to women, arguing that if the law is enforced, all except one abortion clinic in the state would be forced to shut down. Proponents contend that the law is legitimate in light of the state's interest in regulating health.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d550d6d63a6e6245509e8ec1a54cc2128a.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuSchv0?text=&docid=177724&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=611268">upheld</a> [judgment] EU rules that will require health warnings to cover 65 percent of a cigarette pack. The rules, <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/eu-parliament-votes-to-approve-smoking-regulations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the EU Parliament in 2014, also ban the advertising of e-cigarettes. Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco had challenged the rules, arguing that the EU was overstepping its authority. The court's ruling is final and cannot be appealed. The new rules are set to take effect later this month.</p>

<p>The EU is not the first to face the issue of graphic warning labels for cigarette packagining. In 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand approved a new regulation requiring packs of cigarettes sold in the Southeast Asian country to be <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/thailand-court-approves-graphic-warnings-on-cigarette-packages.php">85 percent covered with graphic health warnings</a> [JURIST report].  In 2012 the High Court of Australia <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that requires cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and bans brand logos. In the US, there has also been debate over the constitutionality of graphic cigarette warning labels. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] graphic warnings in August 2012, holding that the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the agency's statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy. However, in March 2012 the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sixth-circuit-upholds-cigarette-warning-labels.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [opinion, PDF] of graphic cigarette warning labels, ruling that portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] are a valid restriction of commercial speech and also upheld the FDA's regulations requiring more prominent graphic health warning labels on packaging struck down in an earlier ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Beijing Municipal High People's Court ruled on Wednesday that Xintong Tiandi (XT), a local leather goods retailer, can continue to use the phrase "iPhone" on its leather goods. According to the <a href="http://www.legaldaily.com.cn/">Legal Daily</a>, the official newspaper of the <a href="http://english.moj.gov.cn/">China Justice Ministry</a> [official websites, in Chinese], the <a href="http://www.legaldaily.com.cn/judicial/content/2016-04/27/content_6603932.htm">Beijing court placed much weight</a> [<em>Legal Daily</em> report, in Chinese] on the fact that XT filed its trademark application to sell the iPhone-branded leather products in 2007, which is two years before <a href="http://investor.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] started selling its handsets in mainland China. The court found this sequence of events to be crucial in dismissing Apple's appeal and stated that the technology giant could not prove that the "iPhone" brand was well known in China before 2009. However, this ignores the fact that Apple applied for the "iPhone" trademark in 2002, which was only approved in 2013. Apple has been disputing this matter since 2012, and stated that it was disappointed with the ruling and that it intends to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-china-idUSKCN0XV0YH">appeal</a> [Reuters report] to the <a href="http://en.chinacourt.org/">Supreme People's Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Apple has been embroiled in controversy in China ever since it started operations in the country. In July 2013 New York-based labor rights group, <a href="http://chinalaborwatch.org/home.aspx">China Labor Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/labor-rights-group-accuses-apple-suppliers-of-violating-labor-laws.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Apple, and its affiliate <a href="http://pegatroncorp.com/">Pegatron</a> [corporate website], which assembles products including the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, of withholding employees' pay and imposing excessive working hours at factories in mainland China. In December 2012 a Beijing court ordered Apple to pay damages of 1.03 million yuan (USD $165,908) to eight Chinese writers and two companies for copyright infringement. The <a href="http://bj2zy.chinacourt.org/">Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese], a regional court directly below China's appellate level courts, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/beijing-court-orders-apple-to-pay-copyright-infringement-damages.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that software available on Apple's app store contained unlicensed digital copies of the writers' books in violation of the plaintiffs' "right of communication through information networks." That decision was the second in four months from the same court ordering Apple to pay USD $83,000 in damages for alleged copyright infringement of a Chinese encyclopedia publisher. In July of the same year, the Guangdong Hich People's Court in China <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/apple-agrees-to-pay-china-company-60-million-for-ipad-trademark.php">confirmed a settlement</a> [JURIST report] reached the previous week in a trademark case whereby Apple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/business/global/apple-settles-an-ipad-trademark-dispute-in-china.html?_r=0">agreed to pay $60 million</a> [NYT report] to Shenzhen Proview Technology for the use of the iPad trademark in mainland China. Although Apple had already paid $55,000 for the trademark in 2009 to the company's Taiwanese affiliate, Proview Taipei, the Chinese affiliate argued that Apple misled it by buying the name through a smaller company, IP Application Development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/nweb/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website] on Thursday rejected Islamist leader Motiur Rahman Nizami's final appeal of his death sentence for war crimes committed in the country's war for independence against Pakistan in 1971. Nizami's conviction was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/bangladesh-court-islamist-leader-appeal-death-sentence-motiur-rahman-nizami">made final</a> [<em>Guardian </em>report] on charges of genocide, murder, torture and rape. A war crimes tribunal, established in 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/bangladesh-islamic-leader-sentenced-to-death-for-war-crimes.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Nizami in 2014. Nizami led Bangladesh's largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, from 2001-2006 and is one of the most significant figures to be prosecuted by the tribunal. It is likely Nizami will be executed now at any time.</p>

<p>This week the <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-4-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." In March the Supreme Court of Bangladesh<a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php"> upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence of a former opposition politician for allegedly committing war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. In February the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-2-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. Last June a Bangladeshi court gave Syed Mohammed Hasan Ali, a fugitive commander of an auxiliary force of Pakistani troops, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-fugitive-commander-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for torture and massacre in the Liberation War. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) on Thursday <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm499234.htm">announced</a> [press release] the finalization of a new rule that extends its regulatory power to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars and more. The new rule reportedly strengthens the implementation of the <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/tobaccocontrol/index.cfm">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009</a> (TCA) [text] and helps the FDA enforce regulations such as prohibiting the sale of any tobacco product to minors to boost the health and safety of the nation. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell stated, "[t]oday's announcement is an important step in the fight for a tobacco-free generation&#8212;it will help us catch up with changes in the marketplace, put into place rules that protect our kids and give adults information they need to make informed decisions." In making the announcement, the FDA reported that tobacco is the leading cause of preventable diseases and accounts for 480,000 deaths a year. The new rule will require all tobacco manufacturers, importers and retailers to conform to the TCA, which as been enforced by the FDA since 2009. </p>

<p>Increased regulation of smoking has been seen throughout the world. This week the EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/eu-top-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-rules.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] rules that will require health warnings to cover 65 percent of a cigarette pack. In 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand approved a new regulation requiring packs of cigarettes sold in the Southeast Asian country to be 85 percent covered with <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/thailand-court-approves-graphic-warnings-on-cigarette-packages.php">graphic health warnings</a> [JURIST report]. In 2012 the High Court of Australia <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that requires cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and bans brand logos. In the US, there has also been debate over the constitutionality of graphic cigarette warning labels. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] graphic warnings in August 2012, holding that the FDA rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the agency's statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of more than 750 detainees held on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea <a href="/paperchase/S99%20Sealed%20Summons%20for%20Injunction.pdf">asked</a> [summons, PDF] the Australian High Court on Wednesday to order their transfer to mainland Australia and block a transfer to the detention center in the island nation of Nauru. The move comes after the Papua New Guinea <a href="http://www.pngjudiciary.gov.pg/home/index.php/supreme-court">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled last week that Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island in northern Papua New Guinea is <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report]. The court found that the detention center violates article 42 of Papua New Guinea's <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Papua_New_Guinea_2014?lang=en">constitution</a> [text], which guarantees personal liberty, and ordered both governments to take steps to end the detention. The 757 detainees, some of whom have been held for more than 1,000 days, allege that both governments have committed human rights violations. A <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/high-court-bid-to-move-asylum-seekers-from-png-to-australia-20160504-gomhb3.html">hearing has been set</a> [SMH report] for May 23.</p>

<p>Last week's ruling is in direct conflict with a recent decision by the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website], which ruled in February that the country's offshore detention policy for asylum seekers is <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">legal</a> [JURIST report], rejecting a challenge that it violates the Australian constitution. The challenge was brought by lawyers for a female Bangladeshi detainee who was brought to Australia for medical reasons. Under the controversial policy, those who seek asylum in Australia arriving by boat are detained on the island nation of Nauru or on Manus Island. The policy has generated outcry from human rights advocates and some politicians. In October <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said that Australia's maritime border control agents have engaged in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-australia-maritime-border-control-abusing-asylum-seekers.php">significant criminal activity</a> [JURIST report], bribery, and abusive treatment of women, men, and children who are seeking asylum. In February 2014 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] called for changes to the way Australia <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/UN-human-rights-office-urges-Australia-reconsider-asylum-policy.php">deals with refugees</a> [JURIST report] seeking asylum, especially in regards to the lengthy detention of asylum-seekers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Wednesday advised North Carolina <a href="http://governor.nc.gov/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official profile] via <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2823498/Doj-Letter-Nc.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] that the state's recently passed <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [text, PDF], violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Assistant Attorney General <a href="https://www.aclu.org/bio/vanita-gupta">Vanita Gupta</a> [official profile] stated that the bill specifically violates <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> [text] by denying certain employees the right to access bathrooms and changing facilities that align with their gender identity. As a result, Gupta found that the bill is facially discriminatory against transgender employees. Gupta further stated that McCrory must express his intent to remedy the bill's violations by next Monday. Should the state not cooperate, the DOJ may apply to the appropriate court and seek a court order forcing the state's compliance with Title VII. Such intervention could have a national impact on states that have passed similar LGBT laws. </p>

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month the North Carolina governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. Last month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that he says is meant to clarify the controversial bill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazil's <a href="http://www.stf.gov.br/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Portugese] on Thursday suspended lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. Cunha currently <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-supreme-court-justice-orders-house-speaker-cunha-to-step-down-1462452277">faces</a> [WSJ report] corruption charges for taking bribes from companies trying to secure oil contracts. He is well known for playing a heavy role in launching the impeachment process against President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff recently accused Cunha of money laundering and holding foreign bank accounts. Cunha's pending corruption trial may jeopardize his current political position as Rousseff's possible successor. </p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians including former presidents have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. In April the Supreme Court of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-takes-over-corruption-case-against-former-president.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that it will take over the corruption probe against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva instead of returning the case to federal Judge Serio Moro. In March a judge for the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-high-court-judge-upholds-order-barring-appointment-of-ex-president.php">upheld a ruling</a> [JURIST report] blocking the former president from taking a ministry post. Also in March, Brazil's Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-supreme-court-authorizes-corruption-trial-for-presidents-rival.php">authorized</a> [JURIST report] the corruption charges Cunha to proceed. Cunha was implicated in the Petrobras scandal. Rousseff herself has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">implicated in that very same scandal</a> [JURIST report] and has been at the center of <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/brazils-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-presidents-impeachment.php">impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] for months. She spoke against the accusations against her earlier this week, stating that she will take legal action against the senator who made statements against her for defamation. More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Non-Alligned Movement (NAM), a loose organization of 120 developing countries, <a href="http://isna.ir/en/news/95021710002/NAM-opposes-US-efforts-to-seize-Iran-assets">stated</a> [text] on Thursday that the US has violated international law by allowing frozen Iranian assets to be dispersed to victims of terrorism. NAM's accusations specifically target last month's US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-rules-terrorism-victims-may-collect-iranian-assets.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], which declared that the use of such assets, guaranteed by the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title22-section8722&num=0&edition=prelim">Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012</a> [22 USC § 8722], was an appropriate exercise of Congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Iran's UN Ambassador <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/bio4694.doc.htm">Gholamali Khoshroo</a> [UN backgrounder] has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/120-nations-accuse-us-top-court-violating-law-38908346">called</a> [AP report] on the US to respect state immunity and to settle the matter with "dialogue and accommodation over coercion and confrontation." Furthermore, Khoshroo has requested the cooperation of <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] in circulating NAM's recent statement and compelling the US's cooperation. A US spokesman has stated that NAM's statement is currently under investigation. </p>

<p>The controversial Supreme Court ruling was in the matter of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-markazi-v-peterson/">Bank Markazi v Peterson</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-iran-terrorism-compensation-case.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/14-770_m64o.pdf">transcript</a>, PDF] for the case in January. The respondents were more than 1,000 individuals that brought suit against Iran for actions related to state sponsored terrorism. To enforce their claims under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605">28 USC §1605A</a> [text], the statute that allows American nationals to seek money damages from state sponsors of terrorism in the courts of the US, petitioners moved for a turnover in 2008 of about $1.75 billion in bond assets held in a New York bank account by the Bank Markazi. The Petitioner Bank Markazi, a/k/a the Central Bank of Iran, argued that § 8722 allowed Congress to usurp judicial authority, which violates separation of powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN top official Stephen O'Brien on Thursday <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/USG_ERC%20Statement%20Syria%20Idlib%20IDP%20camp%20attack%2005May2016.pdf">called</a> [official statement, PDF] for the immediate investigation of recent airstrikes in <correction num=1>Syria</correction> which may amount to war crimes for intentionally targeting civilians. The airstrikes <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53868#.VyzIHxUrK34">hit two displacement settlements</a> [UN report] located in Syria's northern region of Idleb, taking 30 lives and injuring 80 others. O'Brien accused warring parties of not abiding by their international humanitarian obligation to protect civilian lives. He further stated that such disregard for civilian lives eliminates the possibility of allowing the Syrian people to find safe refuge. O'Brien's comments follow <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein's </a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-monstrous-disregard-for-civilian-lives-in-syria.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] last week calling for all parties to disengage from all-out war in Syria to prevent more civilian deaths. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In February the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-syria-systematically-exterminating-detainees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government is systematically exterminating detainees. In November <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php">hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity. In October France opened a torture <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/france-opens-torture-inquiry-into-syria-government-under-assad.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the actions of the Syrian government under Assad in detention facilities. Additionally, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-us-allies-in-syria-committing-war-crimes.php">report </a>[JURIST report] in October detailing the possibility of war crimes in Syria. The AI report criticized the Syrian government by stating that "they have maintained unlawful sieges, restricted humanitarian assistance deliveries, deliberately attacked civilians, and carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks, arbitrary detentions, abductions and enforced disappearances."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/">President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a> [official profile] announced Friday that he does not plan to change the country's anti-terrorism law, a requirement of a deal struck between Turkey and EU in March. Erdoğan <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=76711">made the announcement</a> [<em>Middle East Online</em> report] after Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who was the key figure in achieving this deal, announced he would step down from his position. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. One of the benefits for Turkey was visa-free travel for Turks, but a change in the anti-terrorism law is one requirement that Turkey is required to complete before the EU makes that determination. Erdoğan had <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/turkey-not-change-anti-terror-law-eu-visa-130107660.html">previously told</a> [AFP report] EU leaders that if all promises were not fulfilled, Turkey would not continue its responsibilities to receive migrants under the deal. Experts have expressed concern that the EU-Turkey deal may fall apart if Turkey does not agree to changes in the anti-terrorism law.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. Last month several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also, Turkey's treatment of human rights have been a cause for concern due to the growing partnership with the EU caused by the refugee crisis. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. In March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments. In addition, last month, an independent UN human rights expert encouraged EU leaders to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">remain steadfast </a>[JURIST report] in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU and to avoid making Turkey the "gatekeeper"</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alabama <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/Bios/rmoore.cfm">Chief Justice Roy Moore</a> [official website] was suspended Friday after being charged with violating ethical rules. The Judicial Inquiry Commission <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/311766160/Roy-Moore-COJ-Complaint">accused</a> [complaint] Moore of failing to act impartially and refusing to follow the law when he <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/294755454/Administrative-order">ordered</a> [order] probate judges not to issue same-sex marriage licenses following the US Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [opinion, PDF], which struck down same-sex marriage bans. Moore argued that the Supreme Court ruling only applied to the plaintiff in the case, and probate judges in Alabama had not been ordered to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The commission stated that Moore is bound by the Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution and has violated the law. This is the second time Moore has been removed from office after refusing to adhere to a federal court order in 2003.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage and adoption rights remain in a state of legal uncertainty despite the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] last June that states must allow same-sex marriage and recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. In March the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/alabama-supreme-court-dismisses-petitions-against-same-sex-marriage.php">dismissed petitions</a> [JURIST report] that sought a ruling declaring the state's prohibition on same-sex marriage valid. Moore had instructed state judges not to issue <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">same-sex marriage licenses</a> [JURIST report] in January. The Alabama Supreme Court had ruled in March 2015 that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was legal, and Moore's order stated that ruling remained in effect despite the Supreme Court finding such bans unconstitutional. Moore's order had caused confusion among probate judges, with some defying the order and issuing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] licenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ffrf.org/">Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://ffrf.org/images/A2459503.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against US House of Representatives <a href="http://chaplain.house.gov/chaplaincy/">Chaplain Patrick Conroy</a> [official website] on Thursday after being barred from delivering an invocation. <a href="https://ffrf.org/about/getting-acquainted/dan-barker">Dan Barker</a> [profile], Co-President of the FFRF, was prohibited from offering a secular invocation before the House. Conroy argues that Barker renounced his religion and was no longer a true minister. Although Barker no longer practices the religion that he did when he became ordained, his certificate was still valid. Barker argues that Conroy's actions discriminate against the nonreligious and minority religions. Barker has also included other members of the House in the lawsuit, claiming discrimination against non-believers because no non-believer has ever been asked to offer an invocation in front of the House. </p>

<p>Throughout the country religion continues to raise controversial First Amendment questions. In April the governor of Tennessee <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/tennessee-governor-vetoes-bill-attempting-to-make-the-bible-the-official-state-book.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST, report] a bill declaring the Bible as the official state book. Also in April a California federal judge required Los Angeles County to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/california-federal-judge-orders-removal-of-cross-from-la-county-seal.php">remove</a> [JURIST report] a Latin cross from the county seal. In November a judge for the <a href="http://www.arwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Arkansas</a> [official website] ruled that a nativity scene on Baxter County Courthouse grounds <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-rules-against-courthouse-nativity-scene.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In September the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a six-foot-tall statue of Jesus may <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-religious-statue-to-remain-on-national-forest-land.php">remain</a> [JURIST report] on US Forest Service land. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Death row prisoners in India are <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death-Penalty-India-Report-Summary.pdf">facing inhumane treatment</a> [summary, PDF], according to a two-part <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death-Penalty-India-Report-Volume-1.pdf">report</a> [part one, PDF; <br />
<a href="http://www.deathpenaltyindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Death-Penalty-India-Report-Volume-2.pdf">part two</a>, PDF] released Friday by the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyindia.com/">Death Penalty Research Project at the National Law University in Delhi</a> [advocacy website]. The Research Project interviewed 385 death row inmates in the country and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/india-death-row-prisoners-horrific-conditions-study">found</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] consistent narratives of unfair trials, inadequate communication with legal representation, taunting behavior from corrections officers and rampant torture. The study also acknowledged the trend of death row inmates having primarily low socioeconomic standing and many belonging to the lower castes of society, suggesting systemic bias that should be addressed. The Research Project stated that the study is not meant as an argument for abolition of the death penalty, a discussion that would need to look at factors wider than this report. Rather, they hope to broaden the scope of conversation to examine more than just the nature of the crime that led to the sentence. The report states that while this is usually the focus, there are many problems with treatment that the inmates face that still need to be addressed as a matter of humanity.</p>

<p>In August the <a href="http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in">Law Commission of India</a> [official website] has <a href="http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/Report262.pdf">recommended</a> [report, PDF] that the death penalty be <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/india-law-commission-recommends-abolition-of-death-penalty-for-all-non-terrorists.php">abolished</a> [JURIST report] as a mode of punishment for all crimes except terrorism. This was the first time the Commission had addressed the death penalty since 1967, when they recommended the retention of the death penalty in India. The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] has upheld the death penalty in the past, though they have restricted it to "the rarest of rare cases, to reduce the arbitrariness of the penalty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An eight-member jury in Wichita, Kansas, found Friday that an anti-abortion activist did not intend to threaten a doctor in 2011 with a letter mentioning the possibility of someone placing a bomb under the doctor's car. The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/06/13/FACE_Dillard_Complaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Angel Dillard for sending a letter to Dr. Mila Means, who had expressed her intention to perform abortions in the city two years after a well-known abortion provider was murdered. The DOJ filed the complaint pursuant to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/statute-18-usc-248">Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act</a> [text], which "prohibits threats against abortion providers or interference with <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2016/05/06/jurors-angel-dillard-case-say-activist-not-intend-intimidate-wichita-doctor/">access to abortion clinics</a>" [Rewire report]. Dillard, who has been quoted as supporting the man who killed the previous abortion doctor, sent the letter to Means, which stated in part:<blockquote>Thousands of people are already looking into your background, not just in Wichita, but from all over the US. They will know your habits and routines. They will know where you shop, who your friends are, what you drive, where you live. You will be checking under your car everyday-because maybe today is the day someone places an explosive under it.</blockquote>While the jury found that a reasonable person would believe the letter expressed a true threat of force, they did not find that Dillard intentionally sought to intimidate Means. The foreman of the jury stated that the decision was difficult but based on the language of the law requiring a physical threat, and the jurors found this to be "a more spiritual threat, a more emotional threat." Dillard's lawyer had argued that this was merely protected speech under the First Amendment [text].</p>

<p>Dillard's case had previously been dismissed by the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website], stating the DOJ failed to demonstrate the existence of a true threat and qualified the letter as protected speech as a matter of law. However, the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/appeals-court-rules-letter-to-abortion-clinic-not-necessarily-protected-speech.php">overturned this decision</a> [JURIST report], ruling the status of the letter is not clear and must go to a jury. Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. Last week Louisiana's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-lawmakers-approve-72-hour-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 34-4 to approve <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/BillInfo.aspx?i=229199">legislation</a> [HB 386 materials] that would extend the current 24-hour abortion waiting period to 72 hours. In April the <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] granted a motion to suspend the state's mandatory 24-hour <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/florida-supreme-court-suspends-abortion-waiting-period.php">waiting period for abortions</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-suing-indiana-over-abortion-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state of Indiana, challenging the constitutionality of a recently signed abortion law. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. In March a district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-halts-arkansas-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pill.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Arkansas from enforcing a bill mandating abortion pill providers follow US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines and requiring hospital admittance privileges to handle complications. Also in March West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. The same day, South Dakota's governor signed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protections Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani human rights activist <a href="https://twitter.com/intaffairs">Khurram Zaki</a> [official Twitter] was killed by unidentified gunmen in Karachi on Saturday, according to local police. Four individuals on motorcycles approached a restaurant Zaki was in and <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1256995">opened fire</a> [DAWN report], killing Zaki and wounding two others. Zaki was an activist that campaigned against religious extremism and cleric <a href="http://www.pakistanherald.com/profile/abdul-aziz-ghazi-181">Maulana Abdul Aziz</a> [official profile] of a radical Sunni mosque who incites hatred against Shia Muslims. He was also the editor of <a href="https://lubpak.com/">Let Us Build Pakistan</a> [advocacy website], an alternative media site advocating for a more democratic Pakistan. The police are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/world/asia/pakistani-rights-activist-is-shot-and-killed-in-karachi.html?_r=0">investigating</a> [NYT report] the shooting further to determine if it was a sectarian killing.</p>

<p>Zaki's actions helped led to the investigation and <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-judge-issues-arrest-warrant-for-radical-cleric.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] issued in 2014 for Aziz, head cleric of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6503477.stm">Red Mosque</a> [BBC backgrounder] in Islamabad. Aziz was accused of threatening protesters who were unhappy with his support of the Peshawar massacre, which resulted in the deaths of around 150 people, most of whom were children. Violence and rights violations against human rights activists is prevalent worldwide. Earlier this week four men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/four-men-arrested-in-connection-with-murder-of-honduras-rights-activist.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the murder of Berta Cáceres, the founder of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations Honduras (COPINH) and a prominent defender of indigenous rights and the environment. Last month Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-jails-activists-for-sedition-over-facebook-posts.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] eight activists over Facebook posts in opposition of the government and new draft constitution. Also last month a Gambian civil rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/gambian-activist-dies-while-in-detention.php">activist died</a> [JURIST report] while he was detained for protesting. In April a Chinese civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">disbarred</a> [JURIST report] after he criticized the government on social media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An El Salvador court agreed on Saturday to consider a civil case against former president <a href="https://twitter.com/funescartagena">Mauricio Funes</a> [official Twitter] for alleged illicit enrichment. An unexplained USD $728,000 in expenditures and income is being investigated, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/el-salvador-court-takes-up-case-on-ex-presidents-finances/2016/05/07/d8a25d42-14a2-11e6-a9b5-bf703a5a7191_story.html">no criminal charges</a> [AP report] are attached to the case. Funes' wife and son are also defendants in this case. The <a href="http://www.csj.gob.sv/idioma.html">El Salvador Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/02/160210_el_salvador_funes_juicio_enriquecimiento_ilicito_aw">voted</a> [BBC report, in Spanish] in February to let the case proceed, and a lower court has just agreed to hear the case. Funes criticized the Supreme Court's decision, alleging that the justices who voted for the case to proceed had previously held unfavorable views against his government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. The three journalists were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-court-idUSKCN0XY0A9">tried in absentia</a> [Reuters report] and will have the ability to appeal the ruling. However, a final decision will not come down until June once the Grand Mufti, the highest Sunni religious official in the country, has given his <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/egypt-sentences-death-espionage-case-160507101207579.html">opinion on the decision</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] was supported by Qatar and is also charged with espionage for the country. Al Jazeera criticized the journalists' death sentences, calling for international action to protect press freedom. They also denounced the Egyptian court system, which they claim does not operate independently and hinders freedom and human rights.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts urged Egypt to cease its ongoing crackdown on humans rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">defenders and organizations</a> [JURIST report]. In March Egyptian Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/egypt-justice-minister-removed-following-prophet-mohammed-comment.php">relieved of his position</a> [JURIST report] after making controversial statements on television. After being asked a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists, al-Zind responded that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN human rights experts on Saturday said that detainees in Sri Lanka are still experiencing torture as a tactic used by criminal and terrorism investigators seven years after the country's civil war ended. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/expert-torture-sri-lanka-investigators-38954096">comments were made</a> [AP report] after a nine-day trip to the country where <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/JuanMendez.aspx">Juan E. Méndez</a> [official profile], UN Special Rapporteur on torture, conducted interviews with former detainees, and forensic tests were able to confirm the stories. While fewer cases are reported now than during the decades-long conflict, Méndez said torture persists. Méndez also noted dilapidated and overcrowded prisons, calling the conditions a violation of due process.</p>

<p>Méndez's observations echo those of <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/23/sri-lanka-routine-police-torture-devastates-families">reported</a> [press release] in October that police forces in Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hrw-sri-lanka-police-regularly-torture-suspects.php">regularly torture</a> [JURIST report] and mistreat criminal suspects in custody. HRW Asia director Brad Adams said, "[t]he Sri Lankan police treat the use of torture as an ordinary way of obtaining confessions." HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/282320">compiled allegations</a> [report] of police torture which took place in Sri Lanka between 2014-15 and included beatings, electric shocks, use of stress positions, and failure to provide needed medical treatment among others. The rights group called on the Sri Lankan government to create an independent oversight authority to monitor the police actions and bring an end to the police abuse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The controversial reforms were apart of the agenda of <a href="http://primeminister.gr/">Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras</a> [official website, in Greek], who <a href="http://primeminister.gr/2016/05/08/14781">called</a> [text, PDF, in Greek] for the controversial reforms in order to create a plan to save the country money and prevent further austerity measures:<blockquote>The plan we are voting today seeks to create a system that on the one hand is sustainable and guarantees pensions of all Greeks and Greek women, of all citizens, and the other will have basic principle of social justice in view of the adverse economic conditions.We proceed, then, to the restoration of the pension system sustainability rails, without compromising the primary pensions for the thirteenth time and without affecting the vast majority of auxiliary. Because the vast majority of pensioners, the frightened people who have seen cuts noon, with the 'tell, tell' and the headlines of propaganda impression has passed and that comes next. However, for 92.5%, to 2.1 million pensioners, not cut a penny from their pensions and this is the great achievement of the negotiation effort we made.</blockquote>The reforms were needed to complete the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/greece-under-attack-by-eurozone-creditors-for-lack-of-progress.php">EU  bailout review</a> [JURIST report] and will raise taxes for top earners while at the same time reducing pensions for those who contribute less into the system. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216">debt crisis</a> [BBC timeline] in Greece began in 2009 with a down-grade of a credit rating, and in the following years, has led Greece to borrow hundreds of billions of euros.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Carolina <a href="http://governor.nc.gov/">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=2827581-North-Carolina-s-Complaint-for-Declaratory">complaint for declaratory judgment</a> [text] Monday asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of North Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [text, PDF]. The move comes after the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-north-carolina-lgbt-law-violates-civil-rights-act.php">advised McCrory</a> [JURIST report] last week that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, giving him until Monday to remedy the violations. Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta stated that the bill specifically violates <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> [text] by denying certain employees the right to access bathrooms and changing facilities that align with their gender identity. In a <a href="http://governor.nc.gov/press-release/governor-mccrory-asks-court-clarify-federal-law">statement</a> [press release] Monday, McCrory said:<blockquote>The Obama administration is bypassing Congress by attempting to rewrite the law and set restroom policies for public and private employers across the country, not just North Carolina. This is now a national issue that applies to every state and it needs to be resolved at the federal level. ... They are now telling every government agency and every company that employs more than 15 people that men should be allowed to use a women's locker room, restroom or shower facility. ... I'm taking this initiative to ensure that North Carolina continues to receive federal funding until the courts resolve this issue.</blockquote>The DOJ has yet to comment to McCrory's action.</p>

<p>North Carolina's "bathroom bill" has generated significant controversy. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] HB2, which he considers to be discriminatory. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month the North Carolina governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. Last month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that he said was meant to clarify the controversial bill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian Prosecutor General Nabil Sadek on Sunday referred at least 67 individuals for criminal proceedings in the assassination of chief prosecutor Hisham Barakat. The move comes after it was announced that six individuals were <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2016/03/06/6-suspects-arrested-former-prosecutor-generals-assassination/">arrested</a> [<em>Daily News</em> report] or being held for assisting in the assassination of the prosecutor. The prosecutor general believes that the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> and <a href="http://hamas.ps/en/">Hamas</a> [official websites] <a href="http://en.abna24.com/service/africa/archive/2016/05/09/753068/story.html">conspired</a> [ABNA report] together with more than 100 of their members to murder Barakat last year. It is believed that the murder was carried out <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/208377/Egypt/Politics-/Sixtyseven-people-referred-to-trial-over-assassina.aspx">in an attempt</a> [Ahram report] to bring chaos and disorder into the country to destabilize the region. Hamas has <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/05/09/464645/Egypt-Hisham-Barakat-Egypts-Muslim-Brotherhood-Hamas/">denied</a> [Press TV report] the allegations and has called on its members to abstain from actions inside the country. </p>

<p><a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Hisham+Barakat&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Hisham Barakat</a> [JURIST news archive], was <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/Egypt-top-prosecutor-killed-in-a-car-bomb-attack.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in October in Cairo by a car bomb attack on his convoy. Barakat's vehicle was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/06/egypt-state-prosecutor-motorcade-hit-bomb-attack-cairo-150629083650272.html">attacked</a> [Al Jazeera report] by a car outfitted with explosives that were remotely detonated when his motorcade left his home in Heliopolis. The prosecutor's death marks the country's first assassination of a senior official in 25 years may be the result of retribution attempts by Islamic militants in response to the governmental crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood. It is believed that Barakat became a target as a result of his role as prosecutor against many Brotherhood members and other Islamists, including former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile]. An Egyptian militant group calling itself "Popular Resistance in Giza" claimed responsibility for the remote detonation of the car bomb that killed Bakarat, but the claim could not be independently verified.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.aclu-ms.org/">ACLU of Mississippi</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu-ms.org/files/6114/6257/1319/HB_1523_complaint_-_FINAL.pdf">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Monday challenging Mississippi's controversial <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/2016/pdf/history/HB/HB1523.xml">House Bill 1523</a> [materials]. The law, set to take effect July 1, allows state employees to refuse to issue same-sex-marriage licenses and allows private businesses and religious groups to deny services to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities without the threat of punishment. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a same-sex couple engaged to be married who <a href="http://www.aclu-ms.org/news/2016/05/09/aclu-sues-challenge-unconstitutional-anti-lgbt-mississippi-l">described the law</a> [press release] as "a slap in the face." According to the complaint:<blockquote>As a result of this separate and unequal regime, HB 1523 places Plaintiffs, ACLU of Mississippi members, and other same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage. Even if no discrimination actually occurs, the second-tier status tells all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others.</blockquote>The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>

<p>The intersection of religious liberty and sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US, with multiple states enacting religious freedom bills. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mississippi-governor-signs-religious-freedom-bill-into-law.php">signed HB 1523</a> [JURIST report] into law last month. In March Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a similar religious freedom bill that critics claimed would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe also recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/virginia-governor-vetoes-religious-freedom-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a similar bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three UN rights experts on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19933&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the Egyptian government end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. The experts reported that Egypt has cracked down on protesters, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders in recent years by conducting mass arrests, using aggressive force and invading people's privacy. The experts further referenced recent events such as a security forces storming <a href="http://www.ejs.org.eg/">Egypt's Journalist Syndicate</a> [official website, in Arabic] last week and the use of tear gas last month to disperse more than 380 protestors at a demonstration. They also expressed concern over security provisions and counterterrorism legislation that impedes fundamental rights, stating that the government is undermining "not only public debate and fundamental rights, but security and long-term stability."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. On Saturday an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar.vLast month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts urged Egypt to cease its <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations </a>[JURIST report]. In March Egyptian Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/egypt-justice-minister-removed-following-prophet-mohammed-comment.php">relieved of his position</a> [JURIST report] after making controversial statements on television. After being asked a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists, al-Zind responded that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Miami judge <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article76593292.ece/BINARY/Hirsch%20Death%20Penalty%20Order.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] Monday that Florida's revamped death penalty law is unconstitutional because it does not require a unanimous agreement among jurors to approve executions. The <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2016/7101">law</a> [HB 7101], <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/florida-governor-signs-death-penalty-reforms-into-law.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] in March, only requires 10 out of 12 jurors to agree on imposing the death sentence. The law only requires a unanimous vote on "aggravating factors" that may merit the verdict. The changes were in response to the US Supreme Court ruling in January that the state's previous sentencing scheme was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-overturns-florida-capital-sentencing-scheme.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In the matter of Karon Gaiter, the Miami judge <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article76520707.html">found</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] Monday that the amended law violates the state standard requiring jurors in all criminal cases to reach total concurrence. The judge further stated that, though the numerical difference may be slight, constitutional law does not allow a finding that a jury may be "more or less unanimous." Currently, all states besides <correction num=1>Florida,  Alabama and Delaware</correction> require absolute unanimous jury verdicts for death sentences. </p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment </a>[JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Last month Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The US Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/849946/download">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Monday challenging North Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [text, PDF]. The DOJ alleges that North Carolina is discriminating against transgender individuals in violation of federal law. The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website], comes after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-north-carolina-lgbt-law-violates-civil-rights-act.php">advised Governor Pat McCrory</a> [JURIST report] last week that the law violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, giving him until Monday to remedy the violations. According to the complaint:<blockquote>Defendants State of North Carolina and Governor McCrory have engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of employment rights under Title VII by implementing and requiring compliance with policies and practices that require public agencies to discriminate against their transgender employees based on sex in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment in violation of Title VII.</blockquote>The lawsuit came just hours after McCrory filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/north-carolina-governor-asks-federal-courts-to-weigh-in-on-controversial-hb2.php">complaint for declaratory judgment</a> [JURIST report] asking the federal court to weigh in on the legality of HB2, calling it a "national issue."</p>

<p>North Carolina's "bathroom bill" has generated significant controversy. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] HB2, which he considers to be discriminatory. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month the North Carolina governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. Last month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that he said was meant to clarify the controversial bill. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge in Mexico's Third District for Penal Processes ruled in favor of extraditing Joaquín "el Chapo" Guzmán to the US, a federal court authority said on Monday. Guzmán faces charges of drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering and murder in Chicago, Miami, New York, and others. One of Guzmán's lawyers stated that there are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-guzman-idUSKCN0Y01SP">nine appeals pending</a> [Reuters report] against extradition and that since his client's "legal situation" was still being processed, to extradite him before all legal processes are exhausted would be a violation of his human rights. According to the judge, all legal requirements <a href="http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2016/05/09/nota/5570946/chapo-guzman-puede-ser-extraditado-eeuu-considera-juez">have been met</a> [AP report, in Spanish] in the issue concerning extradition. The judge's identity remains unknown. Mexican government officials have said in private that "the decision to extradite the drug lord is essentially a political call dependent on the president." The Mexican foreign ministry has 20 business days to analyze and make a decision concerning extraditing the drug lord. Guzmán is currently being held, after being transferred, to Cuidad Juárez where his cartel is fighting for control. The head of the federal prisons service denied that the transfer was connected to extradition to the US. </p>

<p>Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán was sentenced for conspiracy to distribute and import cocaine and kept in Mexico's highest security prison, Altiplano, in July. Guzmán escaped from prison that month and a federal official <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/mexico-arrests-seven-in-el-chapo-escape.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that seven of those who were being questioned regarding the prison escape were formally arrested. In August a Mexican judge temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/mexican-judge-suspends-us-extradition-order-for-chapo-guzman.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a US extradition order for Guzmán for an unknown reason and the escape increased tension in US-Mexico relations. In January Guzmán was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mexico-drug-lord-el-chapo-captured.php">recaptured</a> [JURIST report] in Los Mochis, Mexico after a Mexican-military raid left 5 suspects dead and one Mexican official injured. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett said on Monday, will drop its objector status against the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF]. The minister <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/canada-position-un-declaration-indigenous-peoples-1.3572777">made the announcement</a> [CBC News report] at the UN with a delegation of leaders from "he Assembly of First Nations, Native Women's Association of Canada, Métis National Council, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and elders and youth. The declaration's objective is to protect the rights of indigenous peoples with a focus on their right to practice their own cultures, customs, and develop their own economic, political and social institutions. Merrell-Ann Phare, executive director of a Winnipeg-based organization that promotes sustainable First Nations communities, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-drops-objector-status-on-un-indigenous-rights-declaration/article29946223/">stated</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] that the declaration clarifies that governments and indigenous peoples must "negotiate mutually satisfactory resolutions to conflicts." The declaration is not legally binding and many were frustrated with the lack of specific details in the announcement. </p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FblRkAFWzgY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two former Rwandan mayors went on trial Tuesday in the <a href="http://www.courdassises.fr/cour-d-assises-de-paris.html">Assize Court of Paris</a> [official website, in French] on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The two men, Tito Barahira and Octavien Ngenzi, are <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2016/05/09/deux-rwandais-juges-a-paris-pour-genocide_4915946_3210.html">accused</a> [Le Monde report, in French] of "supervis[ing] and participat[ing] in the attack on [Tutsis]," even going as far as killing wounded survivors in a clinic. Because over two decades have passed some have expressed concern over the difficulty of reconstructing facts and evidence. If convicted they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/world/africa/rwanda-ex-mayors-suspected-of-roles-in-genocide-go-on-trial.html?_r=0">face life imprisonment</a> [NYT report].</p>

<p>In January the <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-formally-closes.php">formally closed</a> [JURIST report] after issuing 45 judgments. In September a court in Toulouse, France, <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/france-court-blocks-extradition-of-genocide-suspect.php">refused extradition requests</a> [JURIST report] for Joseph Habyarimana, a Rwandan man, facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In January of last year two Rwandan police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/rwanda-police-officers-jailed-for-killing-anti-corruption-activist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in jail for the murder of a Transparency International anti-corruption activist. In July 2014 the ICTR unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-court-for-rwanda-upholds-sentence-of-ex-military-chief.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 30-year jail sentence for former army chief Augustin Bizimungu for the role he played in the genocide. In December 2012 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Supreme Court nominee <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/scotus">Merrick Garland</a> [WH materials] on Tuesday provided Congress with a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee%20Questionnaire%205%209%202016.pdf">questionnaire</a> [text, PDF] detailing his judicial qualifications. This was the most thorough record of judicial qualifications submitted for a Supreme Court nominee, with the questionnaire totaling 141-pages and a 2,066-page appendix. In response to a question asking Garland to describe the times where his opinion had been reversed, he responded that "[n]one of the opinions [he has] authored ha[ve] been reversed, either by the Supreme Court of the United States or by the District of Columbia Circuit sitting en banc," although some cases for which he was on panel but not the author had been reversed.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Commission of Inquiry on Syria</a> [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19949&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] on factions on both sides of the Syrian civil war to ensure their targets are not unlawful civilian sites such as hospitals. The statement comes after a recent attack on a camp for internally displaced persons that wounded dozens of civilians and killed others. The Commission warned that such targets violate international law and amount to war crimes:<blockquote>[T]here have been over a half dozen attacks against other medical facilities in the area; all of which are specifically protected sites under international humanitarian law. Scores of civilian victims and medical personnel have been wounded or killed in these attacks. In recent weeks, markets, bakeries, and a water station have also been aerially bombarded. With the only one supply route still open to opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo city, the destruction of food, water and medical supplies raises grave concerns for the civilians within.</blockquote><br />
The commission called on all parties to follow established guidelines of lawful targeting and to cease disrupting civilian and humanitarian sites. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. UN top official Stephen O'Brien last Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-official-syria-airstrikes-may-amount-to-war-crime.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the immediate investigation of recent airstrikes in Syria, which may amount to war crimes for intentionally targeting civilians. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein in April  <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-monstrous-disregard-for-civilian-lives-in-syria.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all parties to disengage from all-out war in Syria, expressing deep concern over a "monstrous disregard for civilian lives." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh authorities on Wednesday executed Motiur Rahman Nizami for war crimes during the the 1971 war of independence. <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/gallows-ready-nizami-1221937">Nizami</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report], a leader of the banned Islamist party <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/bangladesh-court-rules-jamaat-e-islami-is-illegal-political-party.php">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> [JURIST report], was convicted for war crimes including rape and genocide and is the fifth JI leader to be executed. Party leaders <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/bangladesh-hangs-nizami-1971-war-crimes-160510182253819.html">claim</a> [Al Jazeera report] that the execution is an attempt to remove the Islamic religion from the region and have called on their followers to strike as a sign of opposition to the hanging. There has been <a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/asia/2016/05/10/bangladeshs-execution-of-jamaat-e-islami-party-leader-nizami-sparks-international-outcry">international criticism</a> [<em>Daily Sabah</em> report] the Bangladesh tribunals, even though the country claims they are <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-top-islamist-leader-1262635">necessary</a> [NDTV report] for the healing process to continue. The parliament of Pakistan has <a href="http://www.radio.gov.pk/11-May-2016/na-offers-fateha-for-executed-ji-bangladesh-leader">officially condemned</a> [RADIO report] the hanging of Nizami, stating the execution was against justice and human rights. </p>

<p>Last week the <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-4-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." In March the Supreme Court of Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence of a former opposition politician for allegedly committing war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. In February the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-2-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. Last June a Bangladeshi court gave Syed Mohammed Hasan Ali, a fugitive commander of an auxiliary force of Pakistani troops, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-fugitive-commander-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for torture and massacre in the Liberation War. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 150 individuals, including 11 children, have died this year in Nigeria's military detention barracks, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://amnesty.app.box.com/s/3g27l903xwlxnnh7x62z3srivgr6a0zo/1/7838163381/64731062681/1">reported</a> [text; <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/nigeria-babies-and-children-dying-in-military-detention/">press release</a>] Wednesday. According to the report, the Giwa detention barracks detains around 1,200 people, many of whom were arbitrarily detained and are being held without evidence. The detainees are allegedly housed in dirty, overcrowded cells and struggle with starvation and dehydration. AI claims the overcrowding is "a consequence of a system of arbitrary mass arrest and detention" in the government's fight against Boko Haram. Netsanet Belay, AI's Research and Advocacy Director for Africa, called for an immediate closure of the Giwa barracks. Nigeria's military spokesman Rabe Abubakar rebutted the report, stating that Nigeria has made improvements to the barracks, and the reported conditions are overstated.  </p>

<p>The militant Islamic group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. In February UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Nigerian government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram. In November the UN Secretary-General <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-sg-condemns-terrorist-attacks-in-nigeria.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] yet another attack by Boko Haram in Nigeria that left 30 dead and approximately 80 injured. In April 2015 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been murdering women and girls previously taken captive by the group. The group has been increasing the intensity and frequency of its <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">attacks</a> [JURIST report] ever since it lost most of the territory it overtook earlier last year to the Nigerian army. Most of these attacks have centered around markets, bus stations, places of worship and hit-and-run attacks on villages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-greater-ohio">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://ppfa.pr-optout.com/ViewAttachment.aspx?EID=mr9WXYw4u2IxYnni1dBRVhVz9V12NJvWMiaOFGvawXQ%3d">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Ohio's health department on Wednesday over a law designed to reduce funding to the organization. Planned Parenthood claims that thousands of patients will be denied access to HIV tests, cancer screenings, health education and prevention programs without the funding. The <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/ohio-governor-signs-bill-prohibiting-funding-for-abortion-providers.php">Ohio law</a> [JURIST report] is to take effect May 23, but Planned Parenthood is attempting to prevent the enforcement. The complaint argues that the law violates their First Amendment rights because they were denied funds for providing abortions. Opponents claim the lawsuit is frivolous, stating that Planned Parenthood is not entitled to any funds at all. This is one of the many laws recently passed in Ohio in efforts to restrict access to abortions. </p>

<p>Planned Parenthood has recently been fighting against many laws seeking to defund the organization. In January US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-vetoes-health-care-repeal-bill.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood. In August Planned Parenthood filed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/planned-parenthood-challengs-alabama-medicaid-funding-cuts.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, alleging that Alabama Governor Robert Bentley's termination of Medicaid provider agreements for the facility violates a federal law that requires Medicaid beneficiaries to have a choice in provider for family planning. Also in August the Alaska Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/alaska-court-strikes-down-abortion-law-limiting-medicaid-funding.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a state law it says would have unfairly burdened low-income individuals by limiting Medicaid funding for abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Italian members of parliament on Wednesday <a href="http://www.governo.it/approfondimento/unionicivili/4707">voted</a> [press release, in Italian] in favor of a law recognizing civil unions of same-sex couples. The Italian Parliament <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/world/europe/italy-gay-same-sex-unions.html?_r=0">voted</a> [NYT report] 372 to 51 with 99 abstentions in favor of the law. The vote makes Italy the last major Western country and last nation in the 28-nation EU to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/12/477780198/italy-becomes-last-western-european-nation-to-legalize-same-sex-civil-unions">grant</a> [NPR report] legal recognition to civil unions. The law stops short of granting same-sex couples the ability to adopt their partners' biological children, and many advocates have simultaneously applauded the vote and admitted that it does not grant full equality to same-sex couples. Opponents of the law have "vowed" to call for a referendum to repeal the law.  </p>

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial international issue. This week the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-mississippi-religious-freedom-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a federal lawsuit challenging a law that allows state employees to refuse to issue same-sex civil union licenses and allows private businesses and religious groups to deny services to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities without the threat of punishment. Last month, the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/colombia-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">made</a> [JURIST report] the country the fourth Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage. Also last month, a judge in China <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-judge-rules-against-same-sex-couple-seeking-marriage-certificate.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to allow a same-sex couple to register as married. In addition, JURIST Guest Columnist Jeremiah A. Ho of the University of Massachusetts School of Law, <a href="/forum/2016/04/jeremiah-ho-lgbtq-legislation.php">discussed</a> [JURIST Commentary report] last month with JURIST the recent anti-LGBTQ legislations in several conservative states and suggested that marriage equality is not enough to protect the LGBTQ minority group. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The senate of Brazil <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2016/05/12/senado-abre-processo-de-impeachment-contra-dilma-rousseff">voted</a> [press release, in Portuguese] on Thursday to suspend and initiate an impeachment trial against President Dilma Rousseff for allegedly borrowing from state banks to cover a deficit and pay for social programs to secure her re-election in 2014. The senate debated throughout the night and voted on Thursday morning <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/destaques/impeachment/pagina/1">55 to 22</a> [tally, official website] to suspend the president. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/world/americas/michel-temer-prepares-to-lead-brazil.html">Vice President Michel Temer</a> [NYT report] will act as leader of Latin America's biggest country while Rousseff steps aside for her impeachment trial that could last <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment.html">six months</a> [NYT report]. During her suspension, Rousseff will not have access to the presidential offices in the Planalto Palace and will not be part of any official host delegation during the upcoming summer Olympics.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. Last week Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. Also last week local Brazilian media <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into Rousseff over alleged connected to the Petrobras corruption scandal. Although there is widespread opposition against Rousseff, her supporters who have <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazils-workers-party-plans-to-rally-behind-the-president-for-the-may-day-celebration.php">rallied</a> [JURIST report] in her support in the past could spell future turmoil in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2830599/House-Obamacare-lawsuit-opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday in favor of House Republicans in a challenge to the <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF]. Judge Rosemary Collyer found that the Obama administration is illegally spending money to fund subsidies under the act without congressional approval:<blockquote>This case involves two sections of the Affordable Care Act: 1401 and 1402. Section 1401 provides tax credits to make insurance premiums more affordable, while Section 1402reduces deductibles, co-pays, and other means of "cost sharing" by insurers. Section 1401 was funded by adding it to a preexisting list of permanently-appropriated tax credits and refunds. Section 1402 was not added to that list. The question is whether Section 1402 can nonetheless be funded through the same, permanent appropriation. It cannot.</blockquote>White House spokesperson <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/josh-earnest">Josh Earnest</a> [official profile] dismissed the ruling, saying the Justice Department would decide whether to appeal. Collyer's ruling has no immediate effect, as she placed it on hold anticipating an appeal by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">ACA </a>[JURIST backgrounder] has generated legal controversy and a series of court challenges since its passage. This <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/us-house-sues-obama-administration-over-unilateral-actions-on-health-care-law.php">lawsuit was filed</a> in 2014, and Collyer <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-judge-rules-health-care-lawsuit-can-go-forward.php">allowed it proceed</a> [JURIST report] last fall. In January the US Congress  sent a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3762">bill</a> [HR 3762] to repeal the ACA to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barrack Obama</a> [official profile], which he <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-vetoes-health-care-repeal-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.ncsl.org">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> [official website] reports that between 2010 and 2015, at least 21 states have enacted laws attempting to challenge or completely opt out of mandatory provisions of the ACA. Most recently the ACA was amended by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1624">Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act</a> [text], which allows states to consider employers with 51 to 100 employees as large employers, removing certain restrictions on small employers from those employers in this category. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-subsidies-apply-to-federal-healthcare-exchanges.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/king-v-burwell/">King v. Burwell</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that tax credits available to those who buy health insurance through state exchanges are also available to those who buy it through the federal exchange. In 2014 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that closely held corporations can deny contraceptive coverage to their employees for religious reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiW6o2DmtfMAhUCRj4KHbFnBJIQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Faclufl.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNFyO1UhYjWgF88dL6OoT_sA-fGv5w&sig2=mlSglVWj2-VIp7kt_hQ6sA&bvm=bv.122129774,d.cWw">Florida American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] filed a <a href="http://aclufl.org/resources/title-ix-complaint-regarding-marion-county-schools/marion-county-schools-doe-ocr-complaint_redacted_scanned/">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the Marion County school district on Thursday, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The complaint was filed after a school suspended a student for using a different restroom than that required under the policy. The school district's policy, adopted as <a href="http://media.clickorlando.com/document_dev/2016/04/26/mariontransgenderresolution_2652905_ver1.0.pdf">Resolution No. 16-001</a> [materials], requires that students use the restroom based upon the gender they were born into, as opposed to the gender that they identify as, or instead use a single-user restroom. The ACLU alleges that the school district has violated <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681">Title IX of the Education Amendments of of 1972</a> [materials], which states in pertinent part, "[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex ... be subjected to discrimination under any [public] education program or activity." The ACLU believes the court should allow the student to use the restroom they identify with, "revise all relevant District policies to ensure conformity with requirements of Title IX," and provide training to the relevant employees of the school district, along with removing the suspension from the student's record.</p>

<p>On Friday the Obama administration stated that it would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/transgender-bathrooms-obama-administration/">issue guidance</a> [CNN report] to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment." This comes as several challenges have been brought to so-called anti-transgender bathroom policies. Earlier this week the Department of Justice filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">complaint challenging House Bill 2</a> [JURIST report], a North Carolina law prohibiting local legislatures from passing laws to protect transgender individual's right to use public restroom and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.  In April the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-transgender-virginia-student-in-bathroom-challenge.php">ruled in favor of</a> [JURIST report] of a transgender student where a school policy required that students use restrooms corresponding with their "biological genders."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0003-judgment.pdf">rejected claims</a> [judgment, PDF] by approximately 600 Iraqi civilians that they were extrajudicially detained and physically abused by British forces. The suit, brought by 14 "lead claimants" representing approximately 600 civilians against the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</a> [official website], alleged that between 2003 and 2009, British forces abused and unlawfully detained Iraqi civilians. The claims, while against British forces, are governed by Iraqi law, and the court applied the Law of Limitation, which meant that some facts relevant in Iraq were not relevant in the British system.</p>

<p>This is the latest development in a controversy that has carried on for more than a decade. In January the head of the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/iraq-historic-allegations-team-ihat">Iraq Historic Allegations Team</a> [official website], charged with looking into alleged abuses committed during the war in Iraq, said that UK soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/uk-official-iraq-veterans-may-face-prosecution-for-war-crimes.php">may face prosecution for war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In 2005 a prosecutor argued at the opening of a <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/british-court-martial-hears-of-killing.php">much-anticipated</a> [JURIST report] British court-martial that seven British paratroopers patrolling in southern Iraq in 2003 killed an Iraqi civilian and abused others after stopping a truck carrying them three weeks after hostilities had officially ended. This was the first trial of British soldiers for the killing of an Iraqi civilian. In 2007 the British Ministry of Defence said that <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/uk-soldiers-spared-courts-martial-for.php">nine soldiers videotaped beating Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in an incident in southern Iraq in 2004 would not face charges before military courts-martial. Then in 2008 it was found that British troops may have tortured and executed up to 20 Iraqi civilians <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/british-soldiers-allegedly-tortured.php">after a 2004 clash between insurgents and a British convoy in Majar al Kabir</a> [JURIST report], The evidence included testimony from several witnesses, death certificates, and video footage of mutilated bodies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/051216zr_4425.pdf">upheld a stay</a> [order, PDF] of execution for Alabama inmate Vernon Madison on Thursday. In a 4-4 order, the court upheld the stay issued by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Madison had argued that he was mentally incompetent due to several strokes and vascular dementia. Based upon precedent set in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7904262174469084060&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Ford v. Wainwright</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2278250008123789539&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Panetti v. Quarterman</a> [opinions], he claims that he is not fit to be executed under the Eighth Amendment. His appeal from the initial state court decision allowing his execution was accepted by the lower federal court, but denied on the merits. The Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.eji.org/files/Vernon%20Madison%2011th%20Circuit%20Order%20Granting%20Stay%20of%20Execution%2005-12-16.pdf">held</a> [stay, PDF] that Madison should be able to appeal the denial of his <span class="casename">Ford</span> appeal for two reasons. First, "jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims," and second, "jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further." Important in the court's analysis was that Ford appeals are generally only justiciable when "a petitioner's execution is imminent." The court reasoned that because Madison's death would "render his appeal moot," the motion for stay of execution must be granted until the issues of reasonable application of law and fact were resolved.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Last month Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Armed opposition groups in Syria are committing war crimes around the Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/syria-armed-opposition-groups-committing-war-crimes-in-aleppo-city/">said</a> [press release] Friday. The human rights group found that these armed opposition groups are routinely carrying out attacks that indiscriminately target civilians and civilian sites, resulting in murder and destruction in the area. AI has greatly relied on third party testimony as well as surveillance footage to document the evidence of destroyed buildings and and deterioration conditions as a result from shelling and possible chemical weapons:<blockquote>As well as being subjected to indiscriminate shelling, civilians in Sheikh Maqsoud are effectively trapped in the area amid a deteriorating humanitarian situation. Continuing clashes have prevented aid from entering Sheikh Maqsoud and people from leaving. Government forces have only allowed civilians requiring medical attention out of the area on the side that they control and have also restricted the entry of medical supplies and food - with only vegetables and bread allowed in. According to residents, the pharmacies in Sheikh Maqsoud are empty, many have shut down.</blockquote>AI has called on the international community to condemn the attacks and to ensure that they are not facilitating abuses though arming opposition groups that target civilians.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. The UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-investigators-states-must-prevent-attacks-on-syria-hospitals.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on factions on both sides of the Syrian civil war to ensure their targets are not unlawful civilian sites such as hospitals. Six human rights organizations, including AI and Human Rights Watch, recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-groups-next-un-chief-must-stand-up-for-human-rights.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the next UN Secretary-General to do everything he or she can to protect innocent civilians whose nations face armed conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">Committee Against Torture</a> (CAT) [official website], a body of independent experts, released closing remarks to its <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/SessionDetails1.aspx?SessionID=1011&Lang=en">fifty-seventh session</a> [materials] Friday, expressing concern about the <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/ISR/INT_CAT_COC_ISR_23917_E.pdf">use of excessive force</a> [concluding observations] by Israeli forces against Palestinians. Last week the CAT engaged in dialogue with Israeli officials about the use of excessive force, especially against minors. The CAT also questioned officials about the standards for confinement and interrogation of detainees, focusing on those in administrative detention. Israeli officials said the nation has been facing an increase in violent attacks since 2015. Officials also said that a significant amount of attacks have been carried out by minors who may have been influenced by media and social networking and that Israeli forces "faced complex situations trying to thwart minor attackers while trying not to harm them." Israeli authorities called the use of administrative detention, a scenario in which a detainee can be held without charge for more than a year, "a preventive measure" used at a rate in direct correlation to the increased number terrorist attacks. The panel asked about the 12 minors currently in administrative detention, to which Israel officials responded that it based some of those detentions on credible information as to the intention of the minors to commit terrorist attacks. </p>

<p>Recent <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">conflicts between Israel and Palestine</a> [HRW backgrounder] over settlements in the occupied West Bank have raised concerns over possible human rights violations. UN Special Rapporteur for Palestinian Territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-expert-accuses-israeli-forces-of-excessive-force-against-palestinians.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Israel in February to address its use of excessive force against Palestinians and to charge or release all administrative detainees. In January <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-urges-businesses-to-cease-operations-in-israel-settlements.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] businesses to cease operations in Israeli settlements. In August UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-officials-denounce-west-bank-arson-attack-that-killed-palestinian-child.php">both sides of the conflict</a> [JURIST report] to reconcile and move towards peace after an attack occurred in the West Bank village of Duma, where Jewish extremists allegedly set fire to a Palestinian home while the family slept.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Alabama <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] signed two pieces of legislation restricting abortion into law on Thursday. The two laws, <a href="http://openstates.org/al/bills/2016rs/SB%20205/documents/ALD00027089/">SB 205</a> and <a href="http://openstates.org/al/bills/2016rs/SB%20363/documents/ALD00027099/">SB 363</a> [materials], prevent the issuance or renewal of health center licenses "to abortion clinics or reproductive health centers performing abortions located within 2,000 feet of a K-8 public school" and prohibit dilation and evacuation abortions, respectively. The first of these bills is likely to <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/05/12/gov-bentley-signs-anti-abortion-bills-lawsuits-likely/84293432/">close down</a> [<em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> report] two of the state's abortion clinics, the two of which accounted "for 72 percent of all abortion procedures in Alabama in 2014." Dilation and evacuation abortions, in which forceps are used to remove fetal body parts, was denounced by those in opposition, who refer to the process as "dismemberment abortion." Despite this opposition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated that the procedure is generally safer than medical abortions. Banning this procedure would result in a significant lessening of second-trimester abortions.</p>

<p>Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. Earlier this month Louisiana lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-lawmakers-approve-72-hour-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] requiring a 72-hour waiting period before receiving an abortion. In April the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-suing-indiana-over-abortion-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state of Indiana, challenging the constitutionality of a recently signed abortion law. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. In March a district court judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-halts-arkansas-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pill.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Arkansas from enforcing a bill mandating abortion pill providers follow US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and requiring hospital admittance privileges to handle complications. Also in March West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. The same day, South Dakota's governor signed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protections Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [website] <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2016-05-13_1463126071.pdf">upheld</a> [judgment, PDF] a set of defamation laws Friday, finding them to be constitutionally valid. The laws were challenged by opposing politicians as an impediment on free speech. The ruling recognized a legitimate interest of the state to restrict free speech to protect from "defamatory or libelous speech or expression," saying "[t]here is a correlative duty not to interfere with the liberty of others." The court emphasized the relationship between free speech and the reputation of each individual, holding that the criminal penalties imposed by the defamation laws are an appropriate tool to uphold the value of an individual's reputation. </p>

<p>India is one of many countries that have struggled to balance citizens' internationally recognized rights to free speech with domestic and international security concerns. Last August India after widespread international criticism, <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/india-government-lifts-ban-on-most-pornography-sites.php">ordered Internet service providers</a> [JURIST report] to allow access to the 857 previously banned pornography and humor websites provided they did not include child pornography. Earlier last year India's Supreme Court <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2015-03-24_1427183283.pdf">struck down</a> [judgment, PDF] a law that gave authorities the power to jail people for offensive online posts. That ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/india-court-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-offensive-facebook-speech.php">welcomed and commended</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://pmindia.gov.in/en/">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> [official website]. Last May JURIST guest columnist Roy Gutterman <a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/05/roy-gutterman-sedition-laws.php">noted</a> [JURIST op-ed] that many countries throughout the world not only still have, but also actively enforce sedition laws. India's own sedition laws, although rarely upheld, result in instant imprisonment for violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/press-releases/senate-armed-services-committee-completes-markup-of-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2017">approved</a> [press release] a measure that would permit detainees at Guantanamo Bay to plead guilty for their crimes through video conferencing, and would also allow the transfer of detainees to third-world countries to reduce the population of the prison. The <a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings-and-legislation/ndaa-national-defense-authorization-act">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017</a> (NDAA) [summary] was approved on Thursday. The provision was included in the hopes of increasing transparency in the transfer and detention of detainees while also increasing military efficiency. The NDAA still prohibits funding to <a href="/forum/2016/03/jared-goldstein-closing-guantanamo.php">close Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The bill does permit the transfer of detainees to the US, but only for urgent medical care.</p>

<p>The bill will be examined carefully, but faces a difficult path to enactment. Another provision included in the legislation is the requirement for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-women-idUSKCN0Y426R">women to register for the draft</a> [Reuters report], which could kill passage of the bill. However, the dramatic effect this legislation would have on the president's power to close Guantanamo could also stymie passage. The US Department of Defense (DOD) <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/dod-transfers-9-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudia-arabia.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the transfer of nine Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainees to Saudi Arabia in April as they continue their efforts to close the facility. Earlier in April the DOD announced the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/2-guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-senegal.php">transfer</a> [JURIST report] of two Guantanamo detainees to Senegal. In February US President Barack Obama delivered a plan to Congress to close <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Government signatories to the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi2htn0xNfMAhUKcT4KHT6fAX4QFggcMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Fresource%2Fdocs%2F2015%2Fcop21%2Feng%2Fl09.pdf&usg=AFQjCNHCRKStN0_TRS64hQ1VHekueGa30Q&sig2=jwUGD0enUdaZ7XwEjbeU-w&bvm=bv.122129774,d.cWw">Paris Agreement</a> [materials, PDF] will meet in Bonn next week and are intent upon discussing human rights issues with the plan. UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and environment, John H. Knox, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=53927#.VzX5uvkgs2x">stated</a> [UN report] Friday that this meeting will be, "[t]he first test of States' commitment to the principles of the Paris Agreement." During this meeting, the government representatives will discuss possible alternatives to the <a href="https://cdm.unfccc.int/">Clean Development Mechanism</a> [official website], which was criticized for its contribution to human rights violations, most notably displacing indigenous communities. Knox hopes that a new sustainable framework can be established with safeguards against potential human rights violations, using "prior assessments, provisions for public participation, and effective grievance procedures," among other mechanisms.</p>

<p>The agreement was reached during the twenty-first annual conference of parties, known as <a href="http://www.cop21paris.org">COP21</a> [official website] and achieved the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, aiming for only a 1.5 degree temperature rise. According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. In July US President Obama and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/30/us-brazil-joint-statement-climate-change">announced an agreement</a> [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/us-brazil-china-set-climate-change-reduction-goals.php">address climate change</a> [JURIST report]. Both countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions by increasing the use of wind and solar power sources to 20 percent of each nation's electricity production by 2030. Brazil also pledged to help reduce the deforestation problem by restoring nearly 30 million acres of Amazon rain forest. China also <a href="http://en.ccchina.gov.cn/Detail.aspx?newsId=53708&amp;TId=96">announced its climate change goals</a> [press release] in July, including reducing its adjusted carbon monoxide output by 60 percent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] on Friday urged authorities in the Gambian capital of Banjul to release detained protesters. The UN stated that it has <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19961&LangID=E">received reports</a> [press release] that the protesters, who were detained "for simply having exercised their rights to freedom of expression, opinion and assembly," have been tortured, denied medical care and denied visitation from family members. Among those individuals currently detained are two female opposition fighters, Fatoumata Jawara and Ngoi Njai, who have been reported to be in poor condition as a result of their detention. The UN also stated that it was concerned with Alhagie Ceesay's condition, asking for evidence that he is not being tortured and that he receives his right to a fair trial. Director of the Teranga FM radio station, Ceesay has faced several medical emergencies as a result of his detention. Finally, the UN also asked for an impartial investigation into the death of activist Solo Sandeng.</p>

<p>The Gambian government's treatment of protesters has been an issue in recent weeks. Last month the High Court in Banjul <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-charges-40-people-after-gambia-protests.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 40 people for offenses related to their participation in protest. In particular, these individuals were "calling for free speech and an electoral forum." Earlier that month several human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-groups-urge-probe-into-death-of-gambia-activist.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the death of Sandeng. Sandeng had been the National Organizing Secretary of the opposition United Democratic party and <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/gambian-activist-dies-while-in-detention.php">"died in detention"</a> [JURIST article] after he was arrested following a peaceful protest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN human rights experts <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19958&LangID=E">expressed grave concern</a> [press release] Friday over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website]. Belarus' actions in killing the man, Sergei Khmelevsky, were in direct opposition with the committee's order to not carry out the sentence while an investigation was still being conducted. According to the experts the country's action constitutes a violation of their obligation under the Optional Protocol to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [materials, PDF]. While every other European country has eliminated use of the death penalty, and despite calls from human rights organizations to do the same, Belarus continues to use resort to the death penalty. Among those executed are seven more individuals whose cases were being examined under the ICCPR.</p>

<p>Belarus has faced continued scrutiny over human rights abuses. In August EU officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/eu-officials-praise-belarus-for-release-of-political-prisoners.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] Belarus' president for his release of political prisoners. In June UN Special Rapporteur on Belarus Miklos Haraszti <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-advocate-cites-belarus-for-continued-imprisonment-of-opponents.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that Belarus continues to sentence and imprison political opponents of the government. In March 2014 he called for the country to end its use of the <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/un-calls-for-moratorium-on-belarus-capital-punishment.php">death penalty</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/belarus-must-stop-executing-its-citizens-un.php#.U1vQaPldXT8">reiterating earlier statements</a> [JURIST reports] and citing politically motivated courts and the lack of fair trials. In 2011 former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay suggested a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention</a> [JURIST report] in Belarus and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Although Belarus is an active member of the UN and has ratified many of its human rights policies, Pillay noted a sharp deterioration in human rights since the 2010 disputed re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/supreme">Supreme Court of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/media/1371141/140776.pdf">upheld</a> [decision, PDF] the state's complicated public school funding system as constitutional Friday. The court noted that financial efficiency was not an issue with the state's public school funding based upon prior precedent, while stating that there is no specific number at which funding becomes efficient or inefficient. Intervenors also argued that the school system was qualitatively inefficient because of its "monopolized statutory scheme" and the existence of school districts as "near monopolies." The court held that the legislature is to be given "broad discretion to make the myriad policy decisions concerning education," and thus monopolistic features are not sufficient to qualify the funding system as inefficient. It was also argued that the funding system imposed a "state-wide ad valorem tax," but the court did not believe there was any evidence of lack of "meaningful discretion," making it not an ad valorem tax at all. While acknowledging the role of judicial review in educational policy-making, the court emphasized that, "[o]ur Byzantine school funding 'system' is undeniably imperfect, with immense room for improvement. But it satisfies minimum constitutional requirements," under the <a href="http://www.constitution.legis.state.tx.us/">Texas Constitution</a> [materials]. The court was emphatic about their role in determining constitutionality, not optimality, and left the legislature with the "urgent challenge [to] upend an ossified regime ill-suited for 21st century Texas."</p>

<p>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. The Supreme Court of Washington last August <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. Also last August the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-court-upholds-regulations-on-loans-at-for-profit-college-loans.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July in favor of tight regulations pointed at the for-profit college industry. The court ruled that the Education Department has the right to demand that schools show that their graduates are financially dependent enough to repay their student loans. In August 2014 a judge for a Travis County Civil Court in Texas <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/texas-judge-rules-education-budget-cuts-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Texas legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty to provide for Texas public schools because the school finance system is structured, operated, and funded so that it cannot provide a constitutionally reasonable education for all Texas schoolchildren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/">Massachusetts Senate</a> [official website] advanced legislation on Thursday aimed at protecting transgender individuals from discrimination. Bill S.735 entitled <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/Senate/S735"> An Act relative to transgender anti-discrimination</a> [official summary], seeks to add the term "gender identity" to the protected classes afforded rights and protections under the law. The act further mandates that places of public accommodation with separate access based on gender must accommodate each individual based on the gender identity that the individual purports themselves to be, even if it contrasts with their biological sex assigned at birth. The bill will now head to the house for a vote and then to the governor before it becomes law. </p>

<p>The fight for the right of transgender individuals to have governmental protections in public spaces has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. On Friday the Obama administration stated that it would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/transgender-bathrooms-obama-administration/">issue guidance</a> [CNN report] to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment." The Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district on Thursday, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice (DOJ)  <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] Monday challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-transgender-virginia-student-in-bathroom-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in April in favor of a transgender Virginia high school student who sued his school for discrimination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uganda police announced on Saturday that opposition leader <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12431180">Kizza Besigye</a> [BBC report] will be charged with treason after he was arrested Wednesday for declaring himself the president of the country despite losing the election to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12421747">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile]. Besigye was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCxC6RWZb8E&feature=youtu.be">sworn in</a> [video] as president in a public ceremony where he accused Museveni of trying to overthrow the Constitution. Besigye was <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Besigye-faces-charges-unlawful-swearing-in/-/688334/3201892/-/c27xlz/-/index.html">subject to a court order</a> [<em>Daily Monitor</em> report] banning him from holding opposition events, which the police claim he violated. The leader of Besigye's party <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Muntu-faults-Judiciary-on-Besigye-treason-case/-/688334/3203332/-/15bb211/-/index.html">claimed</a> [<em>Daily Monitor</em> report] that he was removed and transported by plane to another province without being able to retain or contact legal representation. UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-expresses-concern-over-uganda-elections.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in late February over the tense situation in Uganda since the presidential election. Besigye has run against Museveni, the five-term president, in at least four elections <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/uganda-opposition-kizza-besigye-charged-treason-160514043224644.html">resulting</a> [Aljazeera report] in multiple arrests and claims of brutality.</p>

<p>Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, belongs to the ruling <a href="https://www.nrm.ug/">National Resistance Movement</a> [party website] party. The Supreme Court of Uganda in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/uganda-top-court-upholds-re-election-of-president-museveni.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a legal challenge to the presidential election held in February which resulted in President Yoweri Museveni being re-elected to a fifth term in office. During his swearing in ceremony, officials from North America and Europe <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36278479">walked out of the function</a> [BBC report] when Museveni critiqued the International Criminal Court and withdrew his support for the organization. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.immigration.gov.pg/?view=featured">Papua New Guinea Immigration</a> [official website] authorities stated on Thursday that the 898 refugees at the processing center on Manus Island are no longer detained because they are allowed to leave the facility. The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/manus-island-asylum-seekers-no-longer-in-detention-says-papua-new-guinea">announcement</a> [<em>The Guardian</em> report] is in response to recent international calls for the country to reform its asylum policies. The authorities are allowing the detainees to travel to the mainland but they are still being housed at the processing center.

<p>Under the controversial policy, those who seek asylum in Australia arriving by boat are detained on the island nation of Nauru or on Manus Island. The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last month that Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island in northern Papua New Guinea is illegal. The court found that the detention center violates Article 42 of Papua New Guinea's Constitution, which guarantees personal liberty. A group of more than 750 detainees held on Manus Island <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/manus-island-detainees-bring-legal-challenge-before-australia-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Australian High Court in early May to order their transfer to mainland Australia and block a transfer to the detention center in the island nation of Nauru.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dominican Republic on Sunday will hold elections for over 4,000 positions, including the president, vice-president, members of congress and the municipal councilors. This is the first time in over two decades that elections will be held for <a href="http://www.as-coa.org/articles/weekly-chart-dominican-republics-2016-election">all electoral positions</a> [AS/COA report] in the country. The election cycle is even more <a href="http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2015/05/15/falta-ano-para-las-elecciones-mas-complejas">complex</a> [<em>El Caribe</em> report, in Spanish] because there are over <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/The-Whos-Who-in-the-Dominican-Republic-Presidential-Election--20160511-0054.html">twenty-six parties</a> [<em>TeleSur</em> report] who are running for the electoral positions where the winner is determined by a <a href="http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2016/5/13/59268/Dominican-Republic-to-count-general-election-votes-manually">manual counting</a> [<em>Dominican Today</em> report] of the ballots. As such, there are going to be over 300 legal and judicial <a href="http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2016/05/13/los-comicios-seran-observados-por-mas-3300-personas">observers</a> [<em>El Caribe</em> report, spanish] on hand to ensure that the elections are able to proceed without any issues. Current <a href="http://danilomedina.do/">President Danilo Medina</a> [official website] is expected to win, according to early polls, but will face a run off election if he does win the majority of the votes. </p>

<p>The election comes on the eve of major issues plaguing the country. Judge Vernon Broderick for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York  <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-judge-rules-un-ambassador-not-immune-from-bribery-prosecution.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in February that suspended Deputy UN Ambassador Francis Lorenzo, who represents the Dominican Republic, cannot claim diplomatic immunity on bribery charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish state police on Sunday prevented members from the <a href="http://www.mhp.org.tr/mhp_index.php">Nationalist Movement Party</a> (MHP) [party website, in Turkish] from holding a party congress in direct opposition to <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/biography/">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile], by sealing off a hosting hotel. Police put up barricades and sealed the hotel to prevent party members from gaining access to the hotel where they had planned to hold a congress to challenge the allegedly <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-nationalists-idUSKCN0Y60DO">growing power</a> [Reuters report] of Erdogan. <correction num=1>Some dissident party members</correction> previously undertook judicial measures attempting to force a session, but the courts have <a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkish-police-stop-opp-mhp-congress-from-taking-place/572552">failed to decide</a> [AA report] if the dissidents have a legitimate and legal right to hold an extraordinary congress. The MHP dissidents were <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/mhp-dissidents-fail-to-hold-controversial-congress.aspx?pageID=238&nID=99179&NewsCatID=338">attempting</a> [Hurriyet report] to gain enough signatures to force an extraordinary congress which would allow them to regain some power they lost in the 2015 election.</p>

<p>Erdogan has received significant criticism of late, often for his domestic security policy. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara which has lead to more international attention to the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/turkish-president-refuses-to-change-anti-terrorism-law-despite-eu-deal.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] in May that he does not plan to change the country's anti-terrorism law, a requirement of a deal struck between Turkey and EU in March. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muižnieks in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">called </a>on Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Also in April, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the first round of EU sanctioned deportations from Greece to Turkey on April 4 was "rushed, chaotic, and violated the rights of those deported."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian officials announced on Sunday the conviction and prison sentences of over one hundred demonstrators who were peacefully assembling without a permit. Fifty one individuals were <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/216807.aspx">sentenced</a> [Ahram report] to two years in prison while another hundred and one individuals were sentenced to five years in prison. The sentences were handed down on Saturday in connection with the April <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2016/05/15/101-protesters-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-over-25-april-protests/">demonstrations</a> [Daily News Egypt report] to protest the Red Sea islands being turned over to Saudia Arabia. Many believed the islands were apart of an <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/egyptian-court-jails-51-islands-protests-160514161332461.html"> economic deal</a> [Aljazeera report], and protested against the government decision, leading to the charges of joining terrorist groups and disturbing the peace. The demonstrations were interrupted by police officers who prevented a large scale protest by using tear gas and other security measures. The courts are permitting the convicted to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-rights-trial-idUSKCN0Y50SZ">appeal</a> [Ruters report], as their is a dispute about the evidence and a claim that innocent bystanders were arrested in the disturbance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC profile] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Three UN rights experts on Monday <a href="paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-egypt-must-end-crackdown-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. In early May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts urged Egypt to cease its <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">cease</a> [JURIST report] its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] During an annual session last Friday, <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/">Missouri legislators</a> [official website] passed a bill which will allow all state citizens to carry concealed guns without permits or completed gun training. Republicans supporting the bill <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/us/missouri-lawmakers-pass-sweeping-gun-rights-expansion.html?_r=0">argued</a> [AP report] that the law allows the people to "stand their ground" in moments of danger rather than retreat from a place they are legally entitled to be. Democrats have counter-argued, however, that the new bill will promote shootouts and cause future bloodshed. The state's House and Senate have already approved the bill, however it must still be signed by Democratic Governor <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/about-governor">Jay Nixon</a> [official profile]. Though Nixon <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/news/archive/remarks-gov-nixon-regarding-2016-legislative-session">commented</a> [official statement] on the legislative session, he has yet to express his opinion regarding the gun law. Should the bill pass, Missouri will be among ten other states that have passed similar gun laws not requiring gun permits. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial national topics, and gun awareness has risen in the wake of recent shootings across the nation. Earlier this month, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/georgia-governor-vetoes-campus-concealed-carry-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would have allowed the concealed carrying of handguns on college campuses. Last month Idaho Governor CL "Butch" Otter <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/idaho-governor-signs-law-allowing-permitless-concealed-carry-statewide.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill that made it legal throughout the state for Idaho residents over 21 years of age to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. Earlier that week Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/virginia-governor-vetoes-gun-bills.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] two proposed bills that would eliminate restrictions on the possession of firearms in or around state office buildings. Also that month the West Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-legislature-overrides-veto-on-permitless-concealed-carry.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to override Governor Earl Ry Tomblin's veto of a bill allowing civilians 21 and over to carry concealed weapons without a permit. In December the US Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-vacates-ruling-blocking-dc-gun-law.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling that found that a DC gun law requiring a concealed carry permit outside of the home may violate the Constitution. In October Maine's revised concealed carry law <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/maine-concealed-carry-law-takes-effect-no-longer-requires-permit.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report], allowing legal gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permit. Earlier that month a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Connecticut and New York gun control legislation that ban semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Argentinian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12284208">Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</a> [BBC profile] was charged in federal court last Friday for manipulating the economy in order to resolve the country's low foreign reserves. The ruling judge <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/14/news/economy/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-charged/">found</a> [CNN report] that Kirchner, along with the former finance minister, former central bank chief and 15 other charged officials, conspired to sell $17 billion in futures contracts using an inflated dollar value for the country's own currency. The judge further stated that the illegal action has cost the country $5.2 billion, money which could have been used instead to directly boost the country's own troubled economy. Kirchner's crimes may be <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/15/ex-argentinian-president-facing-20-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-country-of-5billion-5882723/">punishable</a> [Metro report] by 5 to 20 years in prison. She has denied all claims against her and stated that such accusations are politically motivated. </p>

<p>Kirchner has recently been the subject of various corruption investigations. Earlier this month, an Argentinian federal prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/argentina-prosecutor-urges-investigation-of-former-president-for-illegal-enrichment.php">made a formal request</a> [JURIST report] to a judge to conduct an investigation of Kirchner and her son for illegal enrichment in an ongoing money laundering investigation. Last year a judge in Argentina dismissed criminal allegations against Kirchner that accused her of conspiring to shield Iranian officials from responsibility for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Kirchner was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/argentina-president-accused-of-cover-up-in-terrorist-attack.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of the cover up in January 2015. An appeals court in Argentina ruled in May 2014 that a controversial agreement between Argentina and Iran to investigate the 1994 bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/argentina-court-strikes-down-agreement-to-investigate-1994-bombing-of-jewish-community.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The two nations <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/argentina-iran-create-commission-to-investigate-1994-community-center-bombing.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the agreement in January 2013, which permitted Argentine authorities to question the Iranian suspects under Interpol arrest warrants, but only in Tehran. In 2005 Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/argentina-admits-failure-in-jewish.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] formal responsibility for its failure to discover who was behind the 1994 bombing.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1418_8758.pdf">remanded</a> [opinion, PDF] a group of cases challenging the birth control mandate in the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) [text, PDF] to the lower courts for further proceedings. The cases, consolidated as <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/zubik-v-burwell/">Zubik v. Burwell</a> [SCOUTSblog materials], question whether the mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by forcing religious nonprofits to act in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs, whether the mandate serves a "compelling government interest," and whether the government acted with the "least restrictive means" in achieving that interest. After <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-argument-in-birth-control-mandate-challenge.php">hearing oral argument</a> in March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-asks-for-supplemental-briefs-in-birth-control-case.php">requested supplemental briefs</a> [JURIST reports] to "address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners' employees through petitioners' insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees." In a per curiam opinion Monday, the court wrote:<blockquote>Both petitioners and the Government now confirm that such an option is feasible. Petitioners have clarified that their religious exercise is not infringed where they "need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception," even if their employees receive cost-free contraceptive coverage from the same insurance company. ... The Government has confirmed that the challenged procedures "for employers with insured plans could be modified to operate in the manner posited in the Court's order while still ensuring that the affected women receive contraceptive coverage seamlessly, together with the rest of their health coverage."</p>

<p>In light of the positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs, the Court vacates the judgments below and remands to the respective United States Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D. C. Circuits.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, filed a concurring opinion to emphasize that the court had not ruled on the merits and that "the Courts of Appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one on each of the questions presented by these cases."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-grants-cert-in-birth-control-mandate-cases.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in seven cases in November, which were then consolidated into the present case. Petitioners, religious non-profit institutions, challenged aspects of the birth control mandate under the health care reform laws in the US. The mandate has caused a great deal of controversy throughout the country sine its implementation. In 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that for-profit businesses that are "closely held" (i.e., owned by a small number of individuals) <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">may be exempted</a> [JURIST report] from the birth-control mandate of the ACA if the owners had a religious objection to one or more mandated birth control devices or methods, in addition to the non-profit exception. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/13-1339_f2q3.pdf">remanded</a> [opinion, PDF] the class action case <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/spokeo-inc-v-robins/">Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] to the lower court for further review. In a 6-2 ruling, the court found that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erred in its analysis of whether the plaintiff had standing. The question before the court was whether Congress may confer <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art3frag17_user.html">Article III standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] upon a plaintiff who suffers no concrete harm and who therefore could not otherwise invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court, by authorizing a private right of action based on a bare violation of a federal statute. Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority:<blockquote>[The Ninth Circuit's] analysis was incomplete. As we have explained in our prior opinions, the injury-in-fact requirement requires a plaintiff to allege an injury that is both "concrete and particularized." ... The Ninth Circuit's analysis focused on the second characteristic (particularity), but it overlooked  the first (concreteness). We therefore vacate the decision below and remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider both aspects of the injury-in-fact requirement.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Thomas Robins seeks statutory damages under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-41/subchapter-III">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> [text] for a technical violation of the statute that did not cause him any harm. Robins alleges that defendant <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo, Inc.</a> [corporate website], a persons search website, published false information about him. Under the Act, an individual may seek recovery for a bare violation. The case thus raises the constitutional issue of whether the Act confers standing on a plaintiff who alleges a violation of a federal statute but who does not allege any resulting injury. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-racial-discrimination-in-jury-selection.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in November after <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-to-rule-in-standing-labor-law-cases.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in April of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1132_4g15.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-lynch-pierce-fenner-smith-inc-v-manning/">Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Manning</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a securities fraud case may proceed in state court. In an opinion authored by Justice Elena Kagan, the court decided that the jurisdictional test under Section 27 of the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF] "is the same as the one used to decide if a case 'arises under' a federal law." Kagan wrote:<blockquote>Section 27 provides exclusive federal jurisdiction of the same class of cases as "arise under" the Exchange Act for purposes of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331">§1331</a> [text]. The text of §27, most naturally read, supports that rule. This Court has adopted the same view in two prior cases. And that reading of the statute pro­motes the twin goals, important in interpreting jurisdic­tional grants, of respecting state courts and providing administrable standards.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. </p>

<p>Monday's ruling resolves the circuit split on whether Section 27 provides federal jurisdiction over state-law claims based on violations or desired enforcement of the act. The US Courts of Appeal for the Fifth and Ninth Circuits have held that the act does provide federal jurisdiction, while the Second and Third Circuits have held that it does not. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-court-securities-litigation.php">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in December after <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-union-subsidies-state-sovereignty.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] last June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], along with several other organizations, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/dkt_1_-_carcano_v._mccrory_complaint.pdf">asked a federal court</a> [motion, PDF] on Monday block the enforcement of a North Carolina law that they claim targets transgender people for discrimination. The ACLU, the <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/">ACLU of North Carolina</a> and <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy websites] filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] to immediately halt <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf">House Bill 2</a> (HB2) [bill, PDF]. They <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20160516_lambda-legal-aclu-ask-court-block-enforcement-hb2">claim</a> [Lambda Legal report] that the law singles out the transgender community and legislates a person's identity by insisting they "pretend to be something they are not." Last week the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against North Carolina for violating <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act</a> [EEOC report], <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX</a> [DOL report], and the <a href="http://nnedv.org/downloads/Policy/VAWA2005_PL109_162.pdf">Violence Against Women Act</a> [NNEDV report] hours after Governor Pat McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/north-carolina-governor-asks-federal-courts-to-weigh-in-on-controversial-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the DOJ asking a federal court to determine that HB2 does not violate any federal laws.</p>

<p>North Carolina's "bathroom bill" has generated significant controversy. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] HB2, which he considers to be discriminatory. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month the North Carolina governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. Last month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] that he said was meant to clarify the controversial bill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/051616zor_2cp3.pdf">rejected a challenge</a> [order list, PDF] to a law that bans protests on the marble plaza in front of the courthouse. In their decision to deny the petition in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-863.htm">Hodge v. Talkin</a> [docket], the court left in place a <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-supreme-court-to-ban-protests-on-plaza.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website], which found that the law does not violate the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Under the law, protesters are not allowed to gather in the plaza in front of the courthouse but are allowed to gather on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The case was brought by Harold Hodge and the <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/">Rutherford Institute</a> [advocacy website] after Hodge was arrested in January 2011 for wearing a sign protesting the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. The court previously <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Grace_461_US_171_103_S_Ct_1702_75_L_Ed_2d_736_198">ruled</a> [opinion] on the constitutionality of the law governing protests or demonstrations at or near its building in a 1983 case, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10413801109535363266&q=united+states+v.+grace&hl=en&as_sdt=2003">United States v. Grace</a> [opinion, PDF]. The justices then nullified only the law's ban on displays on the public sidewalks around the court building, refusing to strike down the entire law as written. The former law allowed the court's police force discretion to allow only two kinds of activity on its plaza: television crew interviews on days the court had held hearings, and taking photographs for commercial or professional purposes with the court's permission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court: concealment sufficient for bankruptcy fraud</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-145_nkp1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/husky-international-electronics-inc-v-ritz/">Husky International Electronics, Inc. v. Ritz</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that "actual fraud," as it relates to the discharge of debt under the bankruptcy code, may be committed by purposeful concealment and does not require overt misrepresentation. Overturning a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/15-145-op-below.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], the court held that Daniel Lee Ritz, Jr. committed sufficient actual fraud when he transferred assets from a debt-encumbered business to other incorporations before filing for bankruptcy. By doing so, Ritz prevented Husky International Electronics, Inc. from being repaid on the nearly $164,000 debt he owed, prompting Husky to file suit invoking <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523">Section 523(a)(2)(A)</a> [text] of the Bankruptcy Code. This section prohibits a debtor from discharging "any debt... for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by ... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud," a bar the Supreme Court found satisfied by Ritz's concealment. </p>

<p>The case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-145">arose</a> [Oyez summary] after Husky sold electronic equipment to Chrysalis Manufacturing Corp, which is headed by Ritz. Chrysalis owed Husky $163,999.38. In 2007 Ritz began transferring funds from Chrysalis to other accounts and ventures in which he owned stock. In 2009 Husky sued Ritz for the outstanding debt, and Ritz subsequently filed for bankruptcy. In 2011 Husky filed a complaint alleging that Ritz had fraudulently moved funds from Chrysalis to other accounts and ventures in order to be able to file for bankruptcy. The US District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled in Ritz's favor on the issue of "actual fraud," and the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Husky-International-Petition-for-Writ-of-Certiorari.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [petition, PDF] in November, 2015, and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-sex-offender-registration-false-representation.php">heard argument</a> [JURIST report] in March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Friday found Arizona <a href="https://www.mcso.org/About/Sheriff.aspx">Sheriff Joe Arpaio</a> [official profile] in <a href="http://kjzz.org/content/305912/sheriff-joe-arpaio-found-contempt-court-racial-profiling-case">contempt of court</a> [order] for "intentionally" disobeying orders to stop the racial profiling of Latinos. Arpaio, who has dubbed himself "America's toughest sheriff," had been ordered by the court in 2013 to cease extreme tactics aimed at ending illegal immigration, which have included "<a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/05/25/186560430/tough-arizona-sheriff-gets-judicial-reprimand">saturation patrols</a>" [NPR report] in which people are stopped and their immigration status is checked. Those in the lawsuit allege that this constitutes nothing more than racial profiling. A hearing is set for May 31 to determine remedies to ensure Arpaio's compliance and provide damages to the parties.</p>

<p>Last July the US Department of Justice and county officials in Phoenix  <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/doj-settles-discrimination-case-against-arizona-sheriff.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] parts of a discrimination lawsuit filed against the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in 2012. The DOJ filed charges against the Sheriff's Office for discriminatory practices in traffic stops, work and home raids, and in county jails, as well as claims of retaliation.The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ninth-circuit-rules-arizona-county-police-engaged-in-racial-profiling.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in April of last year that Arpaio engaged in practices of racial profiling when conducting traffic stops, and in June a judge for the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/federal-judge-finds-against-arpaio-in-civil-rights-pre-trial-motion.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a pre-trial order accepting the other court's finding of racial profiling. In January of last year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/jurist-a-judge-for-the-2.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Maricopa County officials may not enforce two Arizona identity-theft laws used to convict hundreds of undocumented immigrant workers. In October 2014 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-orders-arizona-sheriff-to-undergo-racial-profiling-training.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Arpaio to undergo the same training as his deputies to assist in the prevention of racial profiling and unlawful detention in the Sheriff's Office as part of the ongoing case against Arpaio for racial profiling. In 2013 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-court-rules-arizona-sheriff-violated-latinos-constitutional-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Arpaio and his department engaged in unconstitutional racial profiling during the execution of immigration patrols.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Debra Brown ordered the <a href="http://www.cleveland.k12.ms.us/">Cleveland School District</a> [official website] to consolidate its high schools and middle schools after rejecting as unconstitutional two alternatives proposed by the district. In her 96-page opinion, Brown wrote:<blockquote>Nearly fifty years ago, the United States Supreme Court announced that "[t]he haltingly slow days of all deliberate speed have given way to the mandated duty to immediately desegregate." ... In the decades since this pronouncement, the District has failed to meet this obligation as it concerns the high schools and middle schools in Cleveland, Mississippi. This failure, whether born of good faith, bad faith, or some combination of the two, has placed Cleveland in the unenviable position of operating under a desegregation order long after schools in bastions of segregation like Boston, Jackson, and Mobile have been declared unitary. More important, and of far greater harm, the delay in desegregation has deprived generations of students of the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an integrated education. Although no court order can right these wrongs, it is the duty of the District to ensure that not one more student suffers under this burden.</blockquote>The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/federal-court-orders-justice-department-desegregation-plan-cleveland-mississippi-schools?version=meter+at+5&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release], with Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Civil Rights Division, stating, "[t]his victory creates new opportunities for the children of Cleveland to learn, play and thrive together."</p>

<p>In 2010 a federal judge <a href="h/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-orders-mississippi.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a southern Mississippi school district to end its practice of allowing students to transfer from their assigned schools and classroom groupings, resulting in a segregated school system. The DOJ initially brought a lawsuit to enforce a 1970 order against the <a href="http://www.wcsd.k12.ms.us/">Walthall County School District</a> [official website] that prohibited the district from racially segregating its schools. The US Supreme Court originally struck down school segregation in the 1954 case of <a href="http://www.tourolaw.edu/patch/Brown/">Brown v. Board of Education</a> [opinion]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-338_lkgn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/sheriff-v-gillie/">Sheriff v. Gillie</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the use of official state letterhead by private debt collectors retained by the state was not misleading. Ohio law allows the state's Attorney General to retain private debt collectors as "special counsel" to collect debts owed to state institutions. The issues before the court were whether special counsel are "state officers" within the meaning of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692a">15 USC § 1692a(6)(C)</a> [text]; and whether it is materially misleading under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692e">15 USC § 1692e</a> [text] for special counsel to use Attorney General letterhead. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court: "Assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that special counsel do not rank as "state officers," we hold, nevertheless, that their use of the  Attorney General's letterhead does not offend §1692e."</p>

<p>Monday's ruling reverses the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15a0087p-06.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which found that, "a jury could reasonably find that the use of the Ohio Attorney General's letterhead by the "special counsel" acting as independent debt collectors ... to result in deceptive, misleading and false representations in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-debt-collection-prisoner-exhaustion.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in March after <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-refusing-blood-alcohol-tests.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/05/16/13-17132.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] protects the right to buy and sell firearms. Three individuals challenged an Alameda County, California, ordinance that prohibits gun shops from being located within 500 feet of a residentially zoned district. The court held that while the ordinance might well be constitutional, it must be subject to heightened scrutiny. According to the court:<blockquote>If "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" is to have any force, the people must have a right to acquire the very firearms they are entitled to keep and to bear. Indeed, where a right depends on subsidiary activity, it would make little sense if the right did not extend, at least partly, to such activity as well.</blockquote>The court's ruling allows the lawsuit challenging the ordinance to proceed, reversing a lower court decision that had dismissed the plaintiffs' Second Amendment claims.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case addressing firearm possession for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2015cv2234-45">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that halted the enforcement of a provision of Washington, DC's strict gun laws. Judge Richard Leon of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] stated that "the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table" and that the district's attempt to limit the right to carry a firearm is the type of policy that the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] had in mind in its landmark decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2739870581644084946&q=DC+v.+Heller&hl=en&as_sdt=2003">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF], where it <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] DC's gun ban. Leon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/us-judge-strikes-down-dc-concealed-carry-gun-law-as-likely-unconstitutional/2016/05/17/d36d35dc-1c49-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html">found</a> [WP report] that the law violates the "core right to self-defense" granted within the Second Amendment. City officials claim the provision and law are necessary to limit crime and violence within the District. This ruling is at odds with an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/new-judge-hearing-challenge-to-dc-gun-law-rules-city-can-keep-enforcing-law/2016/03/07/6c392198-e49d-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html">earlier ruling</a> [WP report] from Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who sided with the city. Opponents of the law have objected to the provision that requires people who wish to carry within the district to show a "good reason to fear injury" or another "proper reason" to carry. The decision means that the District can no longer deny concealed-carry permits to residents who fail to show a good reason for needing a gun but otherwise qualify.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Earlier this month Missouri legislators <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/missouri-legislators-pass-controversial-concealed-carry-law.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing all state citizens to carry concealed guns without permits or completed gun training. In March Idaho's governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/idaho-governor-signs-law-allowing-permitless-concealed-carry-statewide.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] making it legal for Idaho residents to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case addressing firearm possession for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Swedish court <a href="http://www.stockholmstingsratt.se/Om-tingsratten/Nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/Swedish-citizen-convicted-of-genocide-in-Rwanda-/">sentenced</a> [press release] a man to life in prison on Monday for taking part in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26875506">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.stockholmstingsratt.se/">Stockholm District Court</a> [official website, in Swedish] determined that Claver Berinkindi was guilty of genocide and gross crime under international law consisting of murder, kidnapping and attempted murder. More than 800,000 people were killed by Hutus over three months in 1994. Berinkindi was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rwanda-warcrimes-idUSKCN0Y70XQ">charged</a> [Reuters report] in Sweden last year after a Rwandan Gacaca community court convicted him of genocide-related crimes in absentia. This trial is part of a global effort to try those who have committed crimes against humanity no matter where those crimes occurred. Berinkindi was a Rwandan who obtained Swedish citizenship in 2012. He was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/world/europe/sweden-rwanda-claver-berinkindi.html?_r=0">found</a> [NYT report] to have participated in five different massacres in 1994. He was found not only to have rallied people to participate in various killings but also to have killed countless people himself. The court also awarded 15 people damages who had witnessed the loss of a relative at the hands of Berinkindi, ranging from $3,900 to $13,000 and to be taken from Berinkindi's property. Berinkindi has three weeks to appeal the decision.</p>

<p>Earlier this month two Rwandan mayors <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-rwanda-mayors-go-on-trial-in-france.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in France on charges of war crimes ad crimes against humanity committed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In January the <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-formally-closes.php">formally closed</a> [JURIST report] after issuing 45 judgments. In September a court in Toulouse, France, <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/france-court-blocks-extradition-of-genocide-suspect.php">refused extradition requests</a> [JURIST report] for Joseph Habyarimana, a Rwandan man, facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In January of last year two Rwandan police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/rwanda-police-officers-jailed-for-killing-anti-corruption-activist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in jail for the murder of a Transparency International anti-corruption activist. In July 2014 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-court-for-rwanda-upholds-sentence-of-ex-military-chief.php">unanimously affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 30-year jail sentence for former army chief Augustin Bizimungu for the role he played in the genocide. In December 2012 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday signed an initiative that would amend the country's constitution to <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/prensa/reafirma-epn-conviccion-de-asegurar-que-los-mexicanos-tengan-oportunidad-de-ser-felices-sin-importar-condicion-social-o-preferencia-sexual">legalize same-sex marriage</a> [press release, in Spanish] nationwide. Marking the national day against homophobia, Peña Nieto tweeted "I signed reform initiatives to promote marriage equality  and its addition to the Constitution and the Federal Civil Code." The proposal still requires congressional approval. The move follows a June ruling by the <a href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Supreme Court of Mexico</a> [official website, in Spanish], which <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/mexico-top-court-finds-same-sex-marriage-bans-unconstitutional.php">declared it unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] for Mexican states to ban same-sex marriages but did not invalidate any state laws. Same-sex marriage is currently legal only in Mexico City and the states of Campeche, Jalisco, Coahuila, Quintana Roo, Colima, Nayarit and Chihuahua.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Firmé iniciativas de reforma para impulsar que el <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MatrimonioIgualitario?src=hash">#MatrimonioIgualitario</a> quede plasmado en la Constitución y en el Código Civil Federal.</p>&mdash; Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/EPN/status/732647894600142848">May 17, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>If approved, Peña Nieto's proposal would make Mexico the fifth Latin American country to legalize same-sex marriage. <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Argentina</a> became the first in 2010, followed by <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Uruguay</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/brazil-justice-council-effectively-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Brazil</a> [JURIST reports] in 2013. Colombia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/colombia-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] on Tuesday rejected an attempt to block a San Francisco law that requires health warning labels on ads for sugary drinks. The law, approved by City Council last year, requires health warning labels reading, "WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay," to cover at least 20 percent of advertisements that appear on billboards, buses, transit shelters, posters and stadiums. Representatives of the beverage industry challenged the law on First Amendment grounds, arguing that it unconstitutionally compels speech. Judge Edward Chen disagreed, denying plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction:<blockquote>Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim, and it is unlikely that they would suffer irreparable harm if the ordinance were to go into effect. Even if Plaintiffs had established serious questions going to the merits, balancing of hardships does not tip sharply in their favor.</blockquote>The ruling allows the law to take effect in July.</p>

<p>San Francisco is not the first city to attempt to improve public health by taking on sugary drinks. In 2014 New York's highest court ruled that the New York City Board of Health exceeded its powers as a regulatory authority by banning the serving of <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/new-york-top-court-upholds-ruling-blocking-sugary-drink-ban.php">large portions of sugary drinks</a> [JURIST report]. The Portion Cap Rule banned the sale of sugary drinks over 16 ounces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU argued that the law violates the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-42-public-health-and-welfare-chapter-20-elective-franchise-subchapter-i-h-national-voter#anchor_1973gg">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [text], which requires voters to provide only the "minimum amount of information necessary" to determine their eligibility to vote. In her ruling, Judge Julie Robinson granted the ACLU's <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-attempts-to-block-kansas-voter-id-law.php">motion for preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] of the law and ordered Secretary of State Kris Kobach to re-register about 18,000 voters:<blockquote>Under the heightened preliminary injunction standard, Plaintiffs have sustained their burden of making a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Kansas DPOC law violates the NVRA provision that a motor voter registration application can require only the minimum amount of information necessary to enable state officials to assess an applicant&#8217;s eligibility to vote, and that they will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction. Without the injunction, approximately 18,000 Kansas motor voter registration applicants will be precluded from registering to vote solely based on their failure to provide DPOC. The record in this case suggests that there is a less burdensome way for the State to assess whether applicants meet the citizenship eligibility requirement; namely, by asking applicants to complete an attestation of citizenship under penalty of perjury.</blockquote>Robinson stayed her ruling until May 31 to give the state time to appeal.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-refuses-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">refused to block</a> [JURIST report] Texas from enforcing its controversial voter ID law. Earlier in April a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. Also last month a federal appeals court held that a Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. Last year the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lets-wisconsin-voter-id-law-stand.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/14-803.htm">Frank v. Walker</a> [docket], allowing Wisconsin's voter ID law to stand. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Louisiana state Senate voted to pass <a href="http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1004339">House Bill 1081</a> [text, PDF] on Tuesday, banning dilation and evacuation abortion procedures. The bill was approved by the state house in April and is waiting to be signed by <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/page/meet-the-governor">Governor John Bel Edwards</a> [official website] who has expressed his intentions to sign the bill. The procedure is commonly referred to as dismemberment abortion. The bill still allows these second trimester abortions to proceed if it is necessary to prevent a serious health risk to the mother. Opponents of the bill argue that the bill criminalizes the safest method for second trimester abortions and puts these mothers are risk when attempting alternative methods. </p>

<p>Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. Earlier this month Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-governor-signs-two-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] dilation and evacuation abortions. In April the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-suing-indiana-over-abortion-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state of Indiana, challenging the constitutionality of a recently signed abortion law. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. Also in March West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. The same day, South Dakota's governor signed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protections Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29052144">Islamic State</a> (IS) [BBC backgrounder] militants have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/18/libya-isis-executed-dozens-newest-stronghold">executed 49 people</a> [press release] in the Libyan city of Sirte since seizing control in February 2015, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/05/18/we-feel-we-are-cursed/life-under-isis-sirte-libya">reported</a> [text] Wednesday. According to the report, IS has taken control of all aspects of life in Sirte with their strict interpretation of Islamic law. Residents of the city reported public beheadings, corpses hanging from scaffolding and masked individuals breaking into residents' homes and taking them in the middle of the night. IS has been in control of the entire city since August. There are no grocers or hospitals, and schools in the city are no longer in session. HRW called for parties to the conflict in Libya to take all feasible measures to protect citizens within the city. </p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry, in a speech at the State Department, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Shortly before, the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and calling for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that IS is in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">possession of a "large and lethal" arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS claimed <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">responsibility</a> [JURIST report] for a series of coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 120 individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] unanimously approved a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s2040/BILLS-114s2040es.pdf">bill</a> [S 2040, PDF] on Tuesday that would let the families of those killed in the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">September 11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder] sue Saudi Arabia for any role it had in the terrorist plot. The Saudi government has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/us/politics/senate-passes-bill-that-would-expose-saudi-arabia-to-legal-jeopardy-over-9-11.html?_r=0">warned</a> [NYT report] that if such legislation passes it may begin selling off up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and other assets in the US. Questions about the role Saudi Arabia played in 9/11 have lingered for more than a decade. Until now, previous attempts to sue Saudi Arabia <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-usa-congress-idUSKCN0Y8239">have been foiled</a> [Reuters report] due to laws that give foreign nations immunity for lawsuits in American courts. This bill creates an exception for foreign countries that are found culpable for terrorist attacks that kill American citizens within the US. The bill must now pass through the House before it goes to the president's desk. US President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the legislation.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that litigation against Saudi Arabia for the 9/11 attacks has been an issue. In 2012 judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03MDL1570_RCC_011905.PDF">dismissed</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">report</a>] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a> [official website] <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/05/17/statement-prime-minister-canada-international-day-against-homophobia-transphobia-and">introduced</a> [press release] legislation Tuesday that would ban transgender discrimination, including it within Canada's hate crime laws. In his announcement of the legislation, Trudeau <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/world/americas/canada-transgender-discrimination.html">stated</a> [NYT report] "everyone deserves to live free of stigma, persecution and discrimination [and] today is about ensuring that all people ... feel safe and secure and empowered to freely express themselves." The legislation <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/17/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-announces-ban-on-transgender-discrimi/">covers</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] both gender identity and gender expression, thereby protecting not only how people define themselves but also how they choose to dress or act. The legislation includes changes to both the Federal Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act. Under the federal code, transgender people would be included within the law that makes it a crime to make "hate propaganda" against members of specific groups.</p>

<p>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. In April a labor arbitration panel in China <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-arbitration-panel-hears-first-transgender-job-discrimination-suit.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] the first transgender job discrimination suit in the country. In March Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/arkansas-ag-to-appeal-ruling-upholding-local-anti-discrimination-ordinance.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a judge' s decision upholding an ordinance that protects members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from discrimination. A day earlier, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">not defend</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials], which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1457_21o2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/betterman-v-montana/">Betterman v. Montana</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] right to a "speedy trial" ends at conviction. A criminal defendant is entitled to a speedy and public trial, and this case dealt with the question of whether protecting a criminal defendant from inordinate delay in the final disposition of his case falls under the provisions of the amendment. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court:<blockquote>We hold that the guarantee protects the accused from arrest or indictment through trial, but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges. For inordinate delay in sentencing, although the Speedy Trial Clause does not govern, a defendant may have other recourse, including, in appropriate circumstances, tailored relief under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also filed a concurring opinion.</p>

<p>Thursday's ruling affirms a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14-1457-op-below.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the Supreme Court of Montana. The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-title-vii-attorneys-fees-sentencing-speed.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) [advocacy website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-files-lawsuit-over-flint-water-crisis">announced</a> [press release] the filing of a <a href="http://action.naacp.org/page/-/Complaint-Filed-Flint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against Michigan officials over the Flint water contamination crisis. The lawsuit, filed in March in the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] accuses Governor Rick Snyder, several state officials and two engineering firms of "gross negligence" and "outrageous conduct." According to the complaint:<blockquote>The Individual Defendants, in their actions and omissions, intentionally and/or with deliberate indifference to an unreasonable risk of harm, injured Plaintiffs and deprived them of their constiutionally guaranteed liberty and property interests by providing and selling Plaintiffs and the Class unusable water that they knew or should have known was contaminated with lead; failing to take remedial measures they knew or should have known would prevent further harm; and failing to warn Plaintiffs and the Class of the contamination of Flint's drinking water, and, consequently, the presence of lead and other contaminants in their homes and rental properties, despite Governmental Defendants' actual or constructive knowledge that this failure to warn would cause harm.</blockquote>The lawsuit seeks property damages, pain and suffering damages, emotional distress damages, medical monitoring, and other injunctive relief for affected city residents and businesses.</p>

<p>This is one of numerous lawsuits that have been filed in response to the Flint water contamination crisis. Last month a group of Flint residents <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/flint-residents-sue-epa-over-lead-contaminated-water.php">filed an administrative complaint</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] for negligence in handling the Flint water crisis. David Leyton, a prosecutor in Genesee County, Michigan, announced last month that a Michigan judge would <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/officials-facing-criminal-charges-over-flint-water-crisis.php">allow criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against three people involved in the water crisis in Flint, including the man who supervised the treatment plant as well as two state environmental officials. Earlier in April the city of Flint <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/city-of-flint-files-intent-to-sue-letter-with-state-no-suit-yet.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an intent to sue letter with the state, claiming that the city lacks funds to defend itself against lawsuit filed during the water crisis. Hertz Schram PC , a southeastern Michigan firm, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/class-action-lawsuit-filed-on-behalf-of-flint-children-exposed-to-water.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit in March on behalf of the children in Flint who were injured by exposure to the high levels of lead in the city's drinking water. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Carolina lawmakers on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/query.php?search=DOC&searchtext=pain%20capable&category=LEGISLATION&session=121&conid=8206598&result_pos=0&keyval=1213114&numrows=10">approved a bill</a> [H 3114 materials] that would ban abortions at 20 weeks or later. The House of Representatives voted 79-29 in favor of the bill, which does not contain exceptions for rape or incest. Proponents claim the bill is necessary because there is evidence to suggest that fetuses can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/us/south-carolina-legislature-approves-ban-on-abortions-at-20-weeks.html">feel pain</a> [NYT report] at 20 weeks. Opponents note that abortions in the second half of pregnancy are rare, contending that this bill poses a "danger" to women. The bill now goes to Governor Nicki Haley, who has indicated her support for the legislation.</p>

<p>Abortion remains controversial across the US, with state legislatures continuing to pass various regulations. If approved, the bill would make South Carolina the seventeenth US state to ban abortions at 20 weeks. Earlier this week the Louisiana state Senate approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-legislature-bans-controversial-abortion-procedure.php">banning</a> [JURIST report] dilation and evacuation abortion procedures. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. Also in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a Texas law that would require abortion clinics to upgrade facilities to hospital-like standards and would require doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19991&LangID=E">welcomed the measures</a> [press release] being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. Pfizer announced its decision to restrict the sale of seven products that have been part of lethal injection protocols in some states. Resale will be restricted, and government entities will need to certify that any product they purchase from the company will not be used for penal purposes. Pfizer also stated its intention to monitor the distribution of its products consistently. The High Commissioner stated, "[i]t is heartening to see companies playing an active role in furthering the trend towards ending use of the death penalty," and called on all businesses to "avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, and ... seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services." Stressing that the UN opposes the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, Zeid also expressed his concern for the potential that states may resort to questionable sources for the drugs required to administer lethal injections and urged them not to engage in such tactics. </p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Last week the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-blocks-alabama-execution.php">upheld a stay</a> [JURIST report] of execution issued by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] for Alabama inmate Vernon Madison. A few days before that a Miami judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/miami-judge-florida-death-penalty-law-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's revamped death penalty law is unconstitutional because it does not require a unanimous agreement among jurors to approve executions. Last month Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">lethal injection drugs become unavailable</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1096_5hdk.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 on Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/torres-v-holder/">Torres v. Lynch</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a "state crime counts as an aggravated felony when it corre­sponds to a specified federal offense in all ways," and that the absence of the jurisdictional element of interstate commerce is "immaterial." The case arose in connection with an immigration matter in which Jorge Luna Torres, a lawful permanent resident in New York for 23 years, challenged the denial of his re-entry to the country based on a single conviction for a state-law-defined aggravated felony. Between Torres' initial entry into the US in 1983 and his state conviction for attempted arson in 1999, his record had been clean. While acknowledging that the Immigration and Nationality Act makes any alien convicted of an "aggravated felony" after entering the US deportable, Torres argued that the aggravated felony must either relate to federal law or a state law that possesses every single element of a federal crime and which is supported by the jurisdictional element of interstate commerce. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the court rejected this argument, stating that, "state and foreign crimes will never precisely replicate a federal statute containing a commerce element" and that such a view "would limit the  penultimate sen­tence's effect in a peculiarly perverse fashion&#8212;excluding state and foreign convictions for many of the gravest crimes ... while reaching those convic­tions for less harmful offenses." The court added that "it is scarcely more plau­sible to view an interstate commerce element in any given offense as separating serious from non-serious conduct. ... The essential harm of the crime is the same irrespective of state borders. ... [T]he national, local, or foreign character of a crime has no bearing on whether it is grave enough to warrant an alien's automatic removal." The dissent, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer, noted that jurisdictional elements are not merely "technicalities," criticized the majority opinion as having the effect of preventing long-time legal permanent residents with convictions for minor state offenses "from even appealing to the mercy of the  Attor­ney General."</p>

<p>Torres' arson conviction is a felony under New York law, but the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-child-pornography-deportation-cases.php">federal statute includes the following language</a> [JURIST report] that the New York statute does not: "Whoever maliciously damages or destroys, or attempts to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive, any building, vehicle, or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce." Both lower courts denied Torres' petition for cancellation of the removal order. This is not the first time that the court has visited the question of "aggravated felony" in connection with deportation hearings. In a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-clarifies-aggravated-felony-for-immigrant-removal-purposes.php">2012 tax fraud case</a> [JURIST report], the court stated that "[a]nyone who is convicted of an offense that 'involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000' has committed an aggravated felony and is subject to deportation pursuant to 8 USC § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of victims of sexual assault in the US Military have been unfairly discharged, according to a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/node/288710/">report</a> [text] Thursday. The 128-page report, the result of a 28-month investigation with the support of <a href="http://www.protectourdefenders.com/">Protect Our Defenders</a> [advocacy website], <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/19/us-raped-military-then-punished">found</a> [press release] that many victims were discharged for a variety of mental health reasons that made them ineligible for benefits. According to the report, these "other than honorable" discharges impact the service members' health care, employment, child custody, disability payments and burial rights among other areas. "Bad paper," a term for an "other than honorable" discharge, has been correlated with high rates of suicide, homelessness and imprisonment. Furthermore, the report notes that under US law, service members are unable to sue the military for harm suffered and the Boards for Correction of Military Records and Discharge Review Boards are often overwhelmed with cases. Due to this, over 90 percent of claims are rejected with no opportunity for review and little to no judicial oversight. HRW urged Congress to create a right to a hearing before the Boards for Correction of Military Records, make this information more available to the public, and create a committee to study the standards for granting relief and determine procedure.</p>

<p>The treatment of veterans has been heavily criticized over the past several years. The military has <a href="/dateline/2015/09/devin-cohen-PTSD-rights.php">come under scrutiny</a> [JURIST op-ed] over the last decade about its treatment of veterans with mental trauma such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Veteran Affairs office has also been heavily criticized for its failures in providing adequate care to veterans. In 2015 President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/obama-to-announce-committee-to-improve-va.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the creation of a new advisory committee to improve conditions in the VA. The committee consists of business leaders, members of veteran organizations and health science professionals with a diverse range of experience. He also <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/obama-signs-suicide-prevention-for-veterans-act-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5059/text">Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act</a> [HR 5059] into law in order to combat increasing suicide rates among American veterans suffering form PTSD. The act was passed by a unanimous Congress and is intended to facilitate veterans' access to mental health resources, as studies have shown that suicide rates are higher among those who do not receive any type of mental health care. In 2014 Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/obama-signs-bill-overhauling-veterans-affairs-department.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.r.4031:">Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014</a> [bill summary] to allow veterans to seek private care outside of VA facilities and provide money for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses. In 2013 the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] reported that the VA grants disability claims for PTSD caused by in-service sexual trauma at <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/va-discriminates-against-victims-of-sexual-trauma-aclu.php">significantly lower rates</a> [JURIST report] than it has granted claims for PTSD arising from other causes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1375_09m1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/crst-van-expedited-inc-v-eeoc/">CRST Van Expedited, Inc v. EEOC</a> [SCOTUSblog materials that <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Section 706 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text] does not require a favorable ruling on the merits for defendant as a prevailing party for the purposes of awarding attorney's fees. In an 8-0 opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court vacated the Eighth Circuits' judgment against attorney's fees and remanded the decision on three other matters. In his opinion, Kennedy <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/05/opinion-analysis-title-vii-defendants-can-recover-attorneys-fees-without-prevailing-on-the-merits/">determined</a> [SCOTUSblog analysis] that the Eighth Circuit's "on the merits" requirement was unnecessary as it was not common sense when plaintiff and defendant have different objectives. In this matter, he stated that a defendant may get what it whats and "prevail even if the court's final judgement rejects the plaintiffs claim for a non-meritorious reason." Second, Kennedy found that there was a lack of any indication that Congress intended an "on the merits" requirement and that such a requirement would lead to further litigation and frivolous lawsuits. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-title-vii-attorneys-fees-sentencing-speed.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in March. The suit arose from the dismissal of a class-wide Title VII claim that had alleged CRST had allowed female truck drivers to be sexually harassed. CRST claimed that they were entitled to attorneys fees under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-5">Section 2003-5(k)</a> [text] of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which provides that a court "in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission of the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19996&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. Mohammadi is currently being held in Evin Prison, which is located in Tehran. The UN rights office expressed concerns for Mohammadi's health, saying, "[she is] believed to have serious medical conditions and has reportedly not been granted adequate access to the specialised medical care she needs." Mohammadi was sentenced to 16 years in prison. The spokesperson said Mohammadi's detention is expressive of a growing trend in Iran against tolerance for human rights. </p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its use of the death penalty. In March UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ahmed Shaheed, expressed continued concern regarding Iran's alarming rate of <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-rate-of-juvenile-executions-in-iran.php">juvenile executions</a> [JURIST report] and other flaws in the justice system. In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] criticized Iran's justice system after 40 men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-criticizes-iraq-over-death-sentences.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report]. In January AI reported on the many <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ai-releases-report-on-death-row-juvelniles-in-iran.php">juvenile offenders</a> [JURIST report] on death row in Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuela's <a href="http://www.tsj.gob.ve/">Supreme Tribunal of Justice</a> (STJ) [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday <a href="http://historico.tsj.gob.ve/decisiones/scon/mayo/187854-411-19516-2016-16-0470.HTML">ruled</a> [judgment, in Spanish] that an economic state of emergency declared by President Nicolas Maduro is constitutional. The declaration, issued on May 13, gives the president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36339721">special reach</a> [BBC report] in matters pertaining to the state of the economy for 60 days. The Venezuelan population is currently suffering from the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36319877">highest inflation rate in the world</a> [BBC report].  The court declared Maduro's response to the situation to be appropriate "given the extraordinary circumstances of social, economic, political, natural and ecological that seriously affect the national economy." Under these circumstances, Maduro will be able to decrease the work week for private businesses to cut-back on electricity. He has already implemented changes by allowing the Venezuelan armed forces to control food disbursal. The decision of the court upholding the decree conflicts with the rejection by parliament earlier this week. </p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government STJ and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December election. Last month the STJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-top-court-rejects-attempt-to-cut-presidents-term.php">rejected an attempt</a> [JURIST report] by the National Assembly to shorten Maduro's term from six years to four.  The assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">approved new new referendum rules</a> [JURIST report] in April to speed up the process of requesting recall referendums. In March the STJ ruled that the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review the appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party. The 13 justices were sworn in on December 23, immediately prior to the exit of prior Socialist Party majority. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">upheld Maduro's economic emergency decree</a> [JURIST report] as legal and valid despite a rejection by the national assembly. The decree allowed the president to control the budget, companies and the currency. In January the STJ ruled that all <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">decisions from the opposition-led assembly would be void</a> [JURIST report] until three opposition lawmakers were removed from their seats. The court's decision came days after the assembly swore in elected lawmakers that were temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">barred by the court</a> [JURIST reports]. The ruling had suspended four elected lawmakers for their involvement in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/venezuela-socialist-party-challenges-recent-election-of-opposition-politicians.php">alleged election fraud last December [</a>JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/">Oklahoma Legislature</a> [official website] approved a bill Thursday that would criminalize performing abortions. The bill, <a href="https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB1552/2016">SB 1552</a> [materials, PDF], reads in pertinent part, "no person shall perform or induce an abortion upon a pregnant woman," and "[violation of] this section shall be guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not less than one (1) year nor more than three (3) years in the State Penitentiary." The legislation would also serve to deny practicing physicians from renewing their medical licenses, except those individuals that perform an abortion to preserve the life of the mother. This exception does not include claims that a woman would commit suicide as a result of having to keep the child. The legislation is perhaps the most radical anti-abortion bill that has been passed thus far, conflicting with the Supreme Court's landmark decision in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/roevwade.pdf">Roe v Wade</a> [opinion, PDF]. Pro-choice groups have been vocal about their opposition to the bill, threatening to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/oklahoma-bill-abortion-doctors.html">challenge</a> [NYT article] the constitutionality of the bill if the governor signs.</p>

<p>Abortion remains controversial across the US, with state legislatures continuing to pass various regulations. Earlier this week South Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-20-week-abortion-ban.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] which would ban abortions at 20 weeks or later. If approved, the bill would make South Carolina the seventeenth US state to ban abortions at 20 weeks. Also this week the Louisiana state Senate approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-legislature-bans-controversial-abortion-procedure.php">banning</a> [JURIST report] dilation and evacuation abortion procedures. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. Also in March the US Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a Texas law that would require abortion clinics to upgrade facilities to hospital-like standards and would require doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals.</p>

<p>UPDATE 5:00 PM ET ~ Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin has <a href="https://www.ok.gov/triton/modules/newsroom/newsroom_article.php?id=223&article_id=21841">vetoed</a> [press release] the legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK's <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] struck down a challenge by several cigarette companies against requiring plain packaging on cigarette packaging. In its almost 400-page <a href="https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bat-v-doh.judgment.pdf">decision</a> [judgment, PDF], the court upheld the <a href="http://ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_877.pdf">Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015</a> [materials, PDF] against the tobacco companies' claims that this regulation would constitute an intellectual property rights violation. In doing so, the court stated that its decision did not rely simply upon financial pluses and minuses, although it did balance these factors, but also weighed the damage to the property rights of the cigarette companies against the benefits to the public health that would arise through this law. As a result of this ruling, tobacco companies will be banned from branding on their cigarettes. In particular they will not be able to use color or brand names to help market their product.</p>

<p>Increased regulation of smoking has been seen throughout the world. Earlier this month the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/fda-finalizes-new-rule-to-extend-regulatory-power-over-all-tobacco-products.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] its regulatory reach to all tobacco products. Just prior to that, the EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/eu-top-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-rules.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] rules that will require health warnings to cover 65 percent of a cigarette pack. In 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court of Thailand approved a new regulation requiring packs of cigarettes sold in the Southeast Asian country to be 85 percent covered with <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/thailand-court-approves-graphic-warnings-on-cigarette-packages.php">graphic health warnings</a> [JURIST report]. In 2012 the High Court of Australia <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that requires cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and bans brand logos. In the US, there has also been debate over the constitutionality of graphic cigarette warning labels. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] graphic warnings in August 2012, holding that the FDA rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the agency's statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Moise Katumbi, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13283212">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> [BBC backgrounder] presidential hopeful, was indicted on Thursday for hiring foreign mercenaries. According to a Reuters report, Katumbi is claimed to have hired the mercenaries in a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-congodemocratic-politics-idUKKCN0YA1ZB">plot against the state</a> [Reuters report] and current president Joseph Kabila. Katumbi called the charges "grotesque lies" meant to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36336697">destroy his current political campaign</a> [BBC report]. A guilty verdict would mean that Katumbi would be forced to end his presidential campaign. Some believe that this accusation may be a power play by Kabila in attempting to maintain his position as the current president, supporting fears of opposition party members that Kabila will not abide by his constitutional obligation to step down after the end of his second term this December.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/democratic-republic-congo">DRC</a> [UN News Centre backgrounder] and surrounding region has seen a high level of conflict in the past decades, and the extension of presidencies has been a contributing issue in many African nations. At the end of January <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] urged African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-sg-urges-african-leaders-to-avoid-using-loopholes-to-cling-to-power.php">"cling to power"</a> [JURIST report]. Last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-drc-using-excessive-force-against-protestors.php">protests and demonstrations</a> [JURIST report] took place across the DRC to oppose the proposed changes in the law that would allow Kabila to extend his presidential term past the allotted two-year limit, and the government was accused of using excessive force against these protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] on Friday repeated its earlier request for the Mexican government to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19996&LangID=E">investigate human rights violations</a> [press release] in Tlatlaya in Mexico State. Among the human rights violations alleged are the deaths of 22 people, including the summary execution of 12 individuals. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani spoke to reporters, restating the UN's concern with the poorly performed investigation, including the handling of seven military personnel that were arrested and charged in connection with the killings. This briefing follows the decision of Mexican court to drop charges against four of the officers in 2015 and freeing the remaining three only last week. While she acknowledged the judiciary's independence and decision-making, she stated that this briefing was meant to "call on Mexican authorities to ensure a thorough, effective, impartial, independent and prompt investigation" into these and other human rights violations.</p>

<p>Mexico has received criticism from multiple human rights organizations for its handling of human rights abuses, as forced disappearances and military violence have come to international attention. Last month three UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-urge-mexico-to-support-human-rights-defenders.php">pleaded</a> [JURIST report] with Mexican authorities to support human rights groups facing extreme criticism in the national media. In 2015 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/28/mexico-police-killings-michoacan">reported</a> [press release] that there is evidence of recent unlawful police killings in Mexico. The report suggests that police action which left eight civilians dead in the city of Apatzingán on January 6, and 42 civilians and one police officer dead in Tanhuato on May 22 was an "excessive use of force against unarmed civilians." That same year, the <a href="http://centroprodh.org.mx/en/">Miguel Agustin Pro human rights center</a> [official website] in Mexico announced that there is evidence that high-ranking Mexican officers gave soldiers orders to kill criminals prior to an army mass slaying of suspected cartel members in June 2014. In 2013 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-to-increase-human-rights-protections-reduce-military-in-policing.php">urged Mexico's government</a> [JURIST report] to better protect against human rights abuses, specifically with respect to the military's use of force against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="https://doc-0s-74-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/8aap6obm338o2ntg142hof31i2u3tpso/1463767200000/15285364390221237946/*/0Bzgzy2KXyxqtMHc4elJtV2VDUHc?e=download">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that Virginia's voter identification law is constitutional. The plaintiffs challenged <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?131+ful+CHAP0725">SB 1256</a> [materials], which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, alleging that it inhibited "equal participation by protected classes in the electoral process" and was discriminatory. The judge rejected these arguments, however, and stated that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the voter ID law was "arbitrary, irrational, or invidiously discriminatory, in either its enactment or implementation" and noted that while the law "added a layer of inconvenience to the voting process it appears to affect all voters equally." The judge finally noted that "the Court's mission is to judge not the wisdom of the Virginia voter ID law, but rather its constitutionality."</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Earlier this week a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. Earlier last month a federal appeals court held that a Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. In March a federal appeals court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In March of last year Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Judge-Hanen-ethics-ruling-5-19-16.pdf">ordered</a> [order, PDF] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] lawyers appearing in multiple states to take ethics classes after finding DOJ lawyers misled the court. Judge Andrew Hanen found that the DOJ lawyers, who had initially been defending the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/ExecutiveActions/EAFlier_DAPA.pdf">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) [materials, PDF] policy, misrepresented information regarding when the government would be implementing and accepting applications for the program, and subsequently misled the court in regards to the number of individuals given their work permits through the program while still under an injunction. In imposing sanctions for these misrepresentations the court held that it would not enforce monetary sanctions because it would not make the states challenging DAPA whole, nor would it serve to deter any future misconduct. Hanen stated, there was "a lack of knowledge about or adherence to duties of professional responsibility in the halls of the Justice Department." He ordered that "any attorney employed at the Justice Department in Washington D.C. who appears, or seeks to appear, in a court (state or federal) in any of the 26 Plaintiff States annually attend a legal ethics course." In addition, the judge ordered that the Attorney General provide a plan within 60 days to prevent any further misconduct and ordered that the government provide a list of roughly 100,000 who entered illegally through early implementation of this program.</p>

<p>The case in which this misconduct occurred has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-immigration-action-this-term.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-against-immigration-initiatives.php">upheld the injunction</a> against DAPA last May, a month after Hanen <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/texas-federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-blocking-presidents-immigration-action.php">declined to lift</a> [JURIST reports] the stay he imposed in February. In March of last year the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-urges-appeals-court-to-reverse-ruling-on-immigrant-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Fifth Circuit to reverse the injunction blocking the president's immigration executive action. In November 2014, President Barack Obama announced two new <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">immigration programs</a> [text], purportedly under his executive authority as president. <a href="https://www.ice.gov/daca">The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and the DAPA would lift the threat of deportation for about 4.7 million undocumented residents by allowing immigrants that have been in the US for more than five years or have children who are citizens to register and pass a criminal background check in order to stay in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner">Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Nils Muiznieks, criticized prisons in Belgium Friday for their "rapidly deteriorat[ing] living conditions. This statement, posted to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Council-of-Europe-Commissioner-for-Human-Rights-118705514972034/?fref=ts">Facebook</a> [website], comes during a three-week strike by prison workers throughout the country. As a result of this strike prison conditions have been severely lessened to the point where prisoners have not left their cells for weeks, have not been able to access counsel or family, and have been unable to receive proper medical care. He also stated that sanitary conditions are worsening, "due to a lack of regular access to basic facilities like showers and bathrooms." The Commissioner asked all parties involved to bring these facilities within international guidelines of human rights, in particular <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dgi/criminallawcoop/Presentation/Documents/European-Prison-Rules_978-92-871-5982-3.pdf">European Prison Rules</a> [materials, PDF]. The Belgian government and trade unions have been in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3600685/Europes-human-rights-body-criticizes-Belgian-prisons.html">negotiations</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] for days to resolve the stalemate.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D596944423814805%26id%3D118705514972034&width=500" width="500" height="262" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p>Prisoners are an at-risk population throughout the world. Last month Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-france-prisons-neglecting-inmates-mental-health.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that France prisons were neglecting inmates' mental health. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Louisiana jails are failing to provide basic HIV services to inmates. HRW also found that Baton Rouge and New Orleans&#8212;the state's two largest cities&#8212;lead the nation in HIV infections every year and the state also leads the nation in rates of incarceration. The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] have been matters of ongoing concern in the US with two groups in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">detailing</a> [JURIST report] recommendations for criminal justice reform in that state earlier last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pentagon <a href="http://www.prs.mil/Portals/60/Documents/ISN762/160519_U_ISN762_FINAL_DETERMINATION_PUBLIC.pdf">announced</a> [press release] Friday that the <a href="http://www.prs.mil/">Periodic Review Board</a> (PRB) [official website] has cleared Afghani Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/762-obaidullah">Obaidullah</a> [NYT materials] for release after almost 15 years of detainment. Obaidullah was <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3602091/Trained-Afghan-bomb-maker-suspected-member-Al-Qaeda-freed-Guantanamo-15-years.html">captured</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] in November 2002 when forces determined he had landmines in his possession and that he had received orders to detonate them. He was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-military-charges-afghan-detainee-at.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with conspiracy and providing material support to terrorist in 2008, but those charges were dismissed by a military tribunal in 2011. The PRB determined that Obaidullah no longer poses a threat to the security of the nation despite his past as a known bomb maker:<blockquote>The Periodic Review Board, by consensus, determined that continued law of war detention of the detainee does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States. The Board has some concern with the detainee's failure to demonstrate sufficient candor related to events prior to detention but, in light of the factors and conditions of transfer identified below, the Board found that the risk the detainee presents can be adequately mitigated.In making this determination, the Board noted that the detainee has not expressed any intent to re-engage in terrorist activities, has not espoused any anti-US sentiment that would indicate he views the US as his enemy, that neither the detainee nor his family have any ties to extremists outside of Guantanamo, and that the detainee has been mostly compliant while at Guantanamo.</blockquote>It is not when known when Obaidullah will be transferred or to where.</p>

<p>There are currently 80 detainees remaining at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. In February US President Obama delivered a plan to Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">close Guantanamo</a> [JURIST report]. Last month the Department of Defense (DOD) announced the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/dod-transfers-9-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudia-arabia.php">transfer</a> [JURIST report] of nine Yemeni Guantanamo detainees to Saudi Arabia. Earlier in April the DOD announced the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/2-guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-senegal.php">transfer</a> [JURIST report] of two Guantanamo detainees to Senegal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/">Oklahoma legislature</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/cf_pdf/2015-16%20INT/SRES/SCR43%20INT.PDF">resolution</a> [text, PDF] Thursday asking Congress to impeach President Barack Obama over his administration's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights">guidance</a> [press release] on ensuring the protection and inclusion of transgender individuals in federal civil rights law. The legislators believe that the president has overstepped his constitutional authority and are requesting that congress initiate impeachment proceedings:<blockquote>The members of the United States House of Representatives elected from this state are hereby requested to file articles of impeachment against the President of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the Secretary of Education and any other federal official liable to impeachment who has exceeded his or her constitutional authority with respect to the letter referenced in this resolution, based upon the grounds that the Constitution of the United States does not grant the executive branch of the federal government any authority whatsoever over the public education system, nor over the use of restrooms or other facilities thereof.</blockquote>The legislature reiterated that they believe in safe and nondiscriminatory environments for all students, but they believe the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/850991/download">measures</a> [text, PDF] announced by the Justice Department are unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>Rights of transgender individuals have become a hot button issue globally. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] legislation Tuesday that would ban transgender discrimination, including it within Canada's hate crime laws. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), along with several other organizations, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-seeks-to-block-north-carolina-hb2.php">asked a federal court</a> [JURIST report] on Monday to block the enforcement of a North Carolina law that they claim targets transgender people for discrimination. The Massachusetts Senate  <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/massachusetts-senate-passes-transgender-rights-bill.php">advanced </a> [JURIST report] legislation last Thursday aimed at protecting transgender individuals from discrimination</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attorneys for Chelsea Manning, the former US military soldier who leaked secrets to <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [advocacy website], on Thursday, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/aclu_manning_amicus_brief.pdf">filed a brief</a> [text, PDF] to appeal her <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year prison term</a> [JURIST report] for violating the Espionage Act. Manning is asserting that her rights to free speech were violated by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [18 USC § 794 et seq.] because the court failed to determine the importance of the interest of the public's need to know the information. Manning also argues that the limiting of speech under the act prevents a democratic society from being able to hold government officials accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the vagueness of the act will have a chilling effect on speech because the government has neither narrowly tailored the restrictions nor has it used the least restrictive means to regulate speech. As such the deterrent effect is to discriminatorily prosecute government whistle blowers and leakers:<blockquote>The conviction and sentence of PFC Manning under the Espionage Act must be overturned for two reasons. First, the Espionage Act is unconstitutionally vague, because it provides the government a tool that the First Amendment forbids: a criminal statute that allows the government to subject speakers and messages it dislikes to discriminatory prosecution. Second, even if the Act were not unconstitutional in all its applications, the military judge&#8217;s application of the Act to PFC Manning violated the First Amendment because the military judge did not permit PFC Manning to assert any defense that would allow the court to evaluate the value to public discourse of any of the information she disclosed.</blockquote>Manning has also <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-chelsea-manning-eff-amicus-brief">appealed</a> [text, PDF] her <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-court-reverse-chelsea-mannings-conviction-violating-federal-anti-hacking-law">conviction</a> [press release] from violating the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> [18 USC § 1030].</p>

<p>Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] for a presidential pardon of her 35-year sentence in September 2013. US Army Major General Jeffery Buchanan <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/army-general-denies-chelsea-mannings-request-for-clemency.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Manning's conviction and prison sentence for turning over classified information to WikiLeaks in April 2014. Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act in July 2013 but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/">Grand National Assembly of Turkey</a> [official website] on Friday advanced an amendment to the constitution to strip members of parliament of their immunity privileges. The assembly voted on the measure with some 376 out of 550 members <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-parliament-controversially-oks-trial-of-deputies-facing-legal-cases.aspx?pageID=238&nID=99434&NewsCatID=338">approving </a> [Hurriyet Daily News report] the constitutional amendment, preventing the need for a referendum on the issue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/20/statement-press-secretary-hr-4238-hr-4336-hr-4923-hr-4957-s-1492-s-1523">signed</a> [press release] a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4238/text">bill</a> [HR 4238 materials] into law Friday that would remove terms such as "Negro" and "Oriental" from federal law in an effort to modernize racial language. The bill seeks not only to replace these terms with African-American and Asian-American, but to also redefine minorities in legislation. Minorities were previously defined as "Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent," and the new language will read US citizens who are "Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Alaska Natives." <a href="http://meng.house.gov/">Representative Grace Meng</a> (D-NY) [official website], sponsor of the legislation, <a href="http://meng.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/meng-bill-to-remove-the-term-oriental-from-us-law-signed-by-president">welcomed</a> [press release] the president's signature:<blockquote>The term "Oriental" has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good. ... No longer will any law of the United States refer to Asian Americans in such an offensive way, and I applaud and thank President Obama for signing my bill to get rid of this antiquated term. Many Americans may not be aware that the word "Oriental" is derogatory. But it is an insulting term that needed to be removed from the books, and I am extremely pleased that my legislation to do that is now the law of the land.</blockquote>The legislation passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has made previous efforts to address racial inequalities. Last July the Obama administration announced new rules requiring cities and towns to address <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/obama-administration-announces-new-fha-rules-to-fight-discrimination.php">racial disparities in their housing practices</a> [JURIST report]. The new rules aim to bring current housing practices in line with the goals of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt//about/hce/title8.php">Fair Housing Act of 1968</a> (FHA) [text]. In 2014 the administration announced new rules intended to <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/obama-administration-to-issue-new-rules-decreasing-racial-profiling.php">decrease racial profiling</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.police.gov.sg">Singapore police officials</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160520_execution_of-_convicted_murderer">announced</a> [press release] the hanging death of Jabing Kho, hours after the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/">High Court of Singapore</a> [official website] denied his final appeal for clemency. Jabing was sentenced to death in 2010 for his part in the murder of a construction worker he assaulted with a piece of wood.  He had exhausted multiple appeals and even temporarily had his death sentence set aside before his execution on Friday. According to the press release:<blockquote>Jabing subsequently applied to the Court of Appeal to review its earlier decision. On 5 April 2016, the Court of Appeal dismissed the application. On 18 May 2016, Jabing filed a criminal motion to the Court of Appeal for a stay of execution. On 19 May 2016, the Court of the Appeal dismissed the application. On the same day, Jabing filed another legal challenge and applied for a stay of execution of the sentence so that the legal challenge could be heard. The application for a stay was heard and dismissed by the High Court on the same day. Jabing further appealed against the High Court's dismissal of the stay application. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 20 May 2016, commenting that the arguments in the legal challenge were unmeritorious in any event. He was represented by counsel throughout the legal process.</blockquote>Singapore <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/death-row-convict-singapore-granted-minute-reprieve-39242491">amended</a> [ABC News report] its death penalty laws in 2012, making the death sentence no longer mandatory for murder or drug trafficking.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-condemns-iran-sentencing-of-human-rights-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-chief-welcomes-pfizer-measures-to-prevent-use-of-drugs-for-executions.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the measures  being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] grave concern earlier this month over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Canadian federal judge on Saturday ruled in favor of deporting a Gatineau man to Rwanda to face trial for suspected war crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26875506">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Henri Jean-Claude Seyoboka, a former soldier who joined the fight against the Rwandan Patriotic Front, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/deportation-gatineau-man-rwanda-war-crimes-1.3591906">came to Canada</a> [CBC report] in 1995 seeking refugee status yet failed to disclose his military background. He lived in Toronto with his family free of any investigations until he was interviewed by the <a href="http://unictr.unmict.org/en">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] in 1998. Following questioning, an anonymous witness accused Seyboka of murdering a neighbor and her children who refused him sex at a roadblock. Seyoboka has denied such accusations and has argued that he will not face a fair trial if he is deported back to Rwanda. Nevertheless, Federal Court Judge Danièle Tremblay-Lamer stated that it is time for Seyboka to face proper justice. </p>

<p>Numerous war crimes suspects have recently been put on trial for their involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Earlier this month a Swedish court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/sweden-court-sentences-man-to-life-in-prison-for-role-in-rwanda-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a man to life in prison for his involvement and was found guilty of genocide, murder, kidnapping and attempted murder. Also this month two Rwandan mayors <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-rwanda-mayors-go-on-trial-in-france.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in France on charges of war crimes ad crimes against humanity committed during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In January the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-formally-closes.php">formally closed</a> [JURIST report] after issuing 45 judgments. In September a court in Toulouse, France, <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/france-court-blocks-extradition-of-genocide-suspect.php">refused extradition requests</a> [JURIST report] for Joseph Habyarimana, a Rwandan man facing charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In January of last year two Rwandan police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/rwanda-police-officers-jailed-for-killing-anti-corruption-activist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in jail for the murder of a Transparency International anti-corruption activist. In July 2014 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/un-court-for-rwanda-upholds-sentence-of-ex-military-chief.php">unanimously affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 30-year jail sentence for former army chief Augustin Bizimungu for the role he played in the genocide. In December 2012 the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted </a>[JURIST report] former Rwandan minister Augustin Ngirabatware, sentencing him to 35 years in prison on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/203657.htm">John Kerry</a> [official profile] offered support to Myanmar's newly democratic government Sunday and urged the country to push more democratic reform and address human rights issues. Though Myanmar is no longer under military rule, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-usa-kerry-idUSKCN0YD01E">stated</a> [Reuters report] that the military will continue to hold seats in parliament until the country has attained peace. Kerry met with Hlaing to discuss political reforms important for Myanmar to complete its transition to a fully democratic system. During Kerry's Myanmar visit, a topic of primary concern has been the continuing displacement and persecution of the country's Rohingya Muslim population. Since 2012, about 125,000 Rohingya Muslims have been displaced after fleeing the conflict between Myanmar Muslims and Buddhists. Kerry has continued talks with Myanmar's Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11685977">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile] to resolve the conflict's ongoing human rights issues. Suu Kyi has stressed the sensitivity of the matter and has requested that Mynamar be given space to address the conflict as it deems necessary. Suu Kyi further pleaded the US to refrain from using the term "Rohingya" in public statements. Despite recent uproar against the use of the term, US officials have stated that they will continue to use the term according to governmental policy. </p>

<p>The democratic reform process has continued in Myanmar since ending a decades-old military rule. Last month 69 political prisoners were <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/myanmar-releases-political-prisoners.php">released</a> [JURIST report] who had been jailed for more than a year without trial. In March Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-myanmar-has-a-historic-opportunity-to-change-course-on-human-rights.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Myanmar's new government has been presented with a historic opportunity to change course on human rights. Also in March Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released </a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military as part of a UN join action plan. In January the country <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/myanmar-begins-releasing-political-prisoners.php">began</a> [JURIST report] the process of releasing the first set of 102 mostly political prisoners days before a democratic power transfer took place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voters in Tajikistan on Sunday approved changes to the country's constitution that will allow President Emomali Rahmon to rule indefinitely, officials said Monday. Voters <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/tajikistan-vote-president-rule-indefinitely-39299627">approved amendments</a> [AP report] to remove presidential term limits, lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 35 to 30 and ban religiously based political parties. The first provision allows Rakhmon, 63, to extend his rule, which he has held since 1992. The second provision would allow his son, Rustam Emomali, 29, to be able to run for president in the next election in 2020. The final provision would continue to ban the main opposition Islamic Revival Party of Tajikistan, which was declared a terrorist organization and banned last year. Election authorites reported that the 41 proposed amendments were <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/tajikistan-referenmdum-approved-rahmon-increasing-power/27751364.html">approved by 94.5 percent of voters</a> [RFE/RL report], with 92 percent turnout.</p>

<p>Tajikistan's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/tajikistan-no-limit-on-presidential-term.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the proposed constitutional amendments in February. In 2014 the UN Special Rapporteur on torture urged the Tajikistan government to implement policies and laws that have been previously adopted by the government in order to <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-rights-expert-urges-tajikistan-to-end-torture-and-ill-treatment.php">end torture</a> [JURIST report] and ill-treatment within the country. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported in July 2012 that torture, beatings and ill-treatment of detainees are common practice in Tajikistan. The human rights group <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/torture-ill-treatment-of-detainees-common-in-tajikistan-ai-report.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the country lacks measures adequately protecting detainees from abuses and ill-treatment and noted that there are more incentives than deterrence for police officers to engage in such practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/">Greek Parliament</a> [official website, in Greek] on Sunday approved the latest round of austerity measures necessary to secure European bailout funds. The measures, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-set-for-austerity-vote-to-secure-bailout-cash-1463917533">approved</a> [WSJ report] by 153 of parliament's 300 members, include raising sales tax and creating a state privatization fund. The vote comes just days before a eurozone meeting expected to approve the next round of bailout funds for the nation. Thousands gathered outside parliament Sunday to protest the measures. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216">debt crisis</a> [BBC timeline] in Greece began in 2009 with a down-grade of a credit rating, and in the following years, has led Greece to borrow hundreds of billions of euros. The Greek Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/greek-parliament-approves-reform-bill-to-aid-victims-of-austerity-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in February that provides health insurance and municipality jobs to poor Greek citizens affected by the country's recent austerity measures. Last October Greek lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/greece-lawmakers-approve-new-austerity-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill containing new austerity measures and economic overhauls under its new bailout program. In April of last year the European Central Bank <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/euro-bank-identifies-risks-in-greece-anti-foreclosure-law.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Greece's draft law that prohibits the government from foreclosing on primary residences where borrowers can prove total wealth requirements as ripe for unscrupulous debtors to engage in strategic defaults without repercussions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-8349_6k47.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in favor of a Georgia death row inmate who claimed racial bias in the jury selection process. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/foster-v-humphrey/">Foster v. Chatman</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court held that the Georgia Supreme Court's decision that petitioner Timothy Foster failed to show purposeful discrimination was clearly erroneous.<br />
The case involves a black defendant and a white victim. The state of Georgia struck all four black prospective jurors, and the prosecution's notes later revealed that the prospective jurors had been identified and labeled as black. The Georgia courts found no race discrimination. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court reversed:<blockquote>The State's new argument today does not dissuade us from the conclusion that its prosecutors were motivated in substantial part by  race when they struck Garrett and Hood from the jury 30 years ago. Two peremptory strikes on the basis of race are two more than the Constitution allows.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, and Justice Clarence Thomas dissented.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-voter-equality-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. The justices questioned the lawyers about whether they had authority to hear the case and then spent the rest of the time on the race issue. Many of the justices appeared to side with the petitioner, pointing out that many of the prosecution's reasons for striking jurors appeared dubious. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/supreme-court-to-rule-in-voter-equality-case.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] last May.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Baltimore judge on Monday acquitted police officer Edward Nero on all counts for his role in the death of Freddie Gray. The <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-nero-verdict-20160521-story.html">verdict</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] followed a five-day bench trial in which Nero faced charges of second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and two counts of misconduct in office. Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams found that there was no credible evidence that Nero was directly involved in Gray's arrest and that his actions were not unreasonable. Nero is one of six officers <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-indicted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] last year. The trial of police officer William Porter ended in a hung jury and mistrial in December. </p>

<p>Gray's arrest and death in April of last year led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In September Baltimore reached a tentative agreement with Gray's family to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-reaches-tentative-64-million-settlement-in-freddie-gray-case.php">pay $6.4 million in settlement</a> [JURIST report]. In April of last year Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">urged Baltimore police to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-613_l5gm.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-1 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/green-v-donahoe/">Green v. Brennan</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the 45-day limitations period for filing a constructive-discharge claim begins running only after an employee resigns. The court was asked to determine whether, under federal employment discrimination law, the filing period for a constructive discharge claim begins to run when an employee resigns, as five circuits have held, or at the time of an employer's last allegedly discriminatory act giving rise to the resignation, as three other circuits have held. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority:<blockquote>We address here when the limitations period begins to run for an employee who was not fired, but resigns in the face of intolerable discrimination&#8212;a "constructive" discharge. We hold that, in such circumstances, the "matter alleged to be discriminatory" includes the employee's resignation, and that the 45-day clock for a constructive discharge begins running only after the employee resigns.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion.</p>

<p>The case was brought after the plaintiff, a former postmaster for the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">US Postal Service</a> [official website], was turned down in 2008 for a promotion in favor of a Latino man. He filed a charge with the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] alleging race discrimination under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/1311">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text], and the matter was eventually settled. Green alleges that he experienced what he perceived to be threats and harassment about his EEOC filing. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-employment-discrimination-case.php">heard arguments</a> in the case in November after <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-to-rule-in-standing-labor-law-cases.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in April of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1504_6khn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/wittman-v-personhuballah/">Wittman v. Personhuballah</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Republican congressmen from Virginia lack standing to appeal a decision regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. The district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the opinion for a unanimous court:<blockquote>Ten Members of Congress from Virginia, intervenors in the District Court below, have appealed a judgment from a three-judge panel striking down a congressional redistricting plan applicable to the November 2016 election. We conclude that the intervenors now lack standing to pursue the appeal. And we consequently order the appeal dismissed.</blockquote>Because the court found a lack of standing, it did not reach the substantive issue of whether the Virginia General Assembly was motivated by race in redrawing the boundaries.</p>

<p>This is the second time the case has come before the Supreme Court, as the court previously remanded the case back to the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] for reconsideration in light of its  decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-895_o7jq.pdf">Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/supreme-court-lower-court-erred-in-upholding-alabama-redistricting-plan.php">report</a>], which held that courts must decide whether race predominated over nonracial considerations when planning districts. The district court again <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2016-01-07-Opinion-Ordering-New-Plan-W3251208x9FAEE.pdf">found the plan unconstitutional</a> [opinion, PDF] in June. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/permission-to-appeal-decision-24-may-2016.html">upheld lower court rulings</a> [press release] that determined citizens who have lived outside of the UK for more than 15 years will not be allowed to vote in the June 23 EU referendum. The statute, the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/europeanunionreferendum.html">EU Referendum Act 2015</a> [statute information] was challenged by two citizens that have been living abroad for decades. Harry Shindler, a 94-year-old World War II veteran, and Jacquelyn MacLennan, a 54-year-old lawyer, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2016-0105.html">argued</a> [case details] that the statute infringed on their common law right to free movement. The court, however, refused permission to appeal the lower court decisions. Lady Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court, recognized the deep "concerns" these citizens have over this issue, but she also stated that the court could not find a sufficient legal basis for the challenge. More than <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36370522">two million</a> [BBC report] British expatriates will be affected by this decision.</p>

<p>UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/david-cameron">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/uk-pm-announces-eu-referendum-date.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in February that the UK will hold the referendum on June 23 to vote on whether the nation will remain a part of the EU. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/06/world/europe/european-union-fast-facts/">EU</a> [CNN backgrounder] is a partnership of 28 European countries for political and economic purposes, with its own currency adopted by 19 member nations. It began in the 1950s as the European Economic Community to promote a single economic market without trade barriers. The UK became a member in 1973 and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">held a referendum</a> [BBC backgrounder] in 1975, with voters electing to remain in the union. The Treaty on the European Union was signed in the Netherlands in 1992, and an EU Constitution was approved by the member nations in 2004. In the years since, many in the UK have voiced concerns about remaining in the EU, with critics saying it has too much control over UK citizens. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/bd629e8d-c4f8-4161-b281-9fbe992e4c05/2/doc/15-496_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/bd629e8d-c4f8-4161-b281-9fbe992e4c05/2/hilite/">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] a 2013 jury verdict that found Bank of America liable for fraud and imposed a penalty of more than $1.2 billion. The Second Circuit <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-countrywide-fraud-case-20160523-snap-story.html">determined</a> [LA Times report] that there was not enough evidence provided to establish that the Countrywide Financial unit of Bank of America committed mail and wire fraud during the years leading up to the financial crisis. Countrywide was not the only company selling questionable mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at the time, but the verdict against Bank of America was held out as the first time banks were held liable for mortgage fraud in events leading to the crisis. However, the Second Circuit stated that there must be proof of fraudulent intent in the setup of the contracts. The Court stated:<blockquote>The government did not prove&#8212;in fact, did not attempt to prove&#8212;that at the time the contracts were executed Countrywide never intended to perform its promise of investment quality. Nor did it prove that Countrywide made any later misrepresentations as to which fraudulent intent could be found.</blockquote>Despite this decision, financial institutions have paid out billions of dollars in settlement agreements since 2008.</p>

<p>The effects of the 2008 financial crisis are still reverberating through the legal system. Last month a federal judge unsealed an <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-overturns-metlife-too-big-to-fail-designation.php">opinion</a> [JURIST report] from late March ruling that the government did not have grounds to designate the major insurance company, Metlife, as "too big to fail," a designation only four firms have received. The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [official website] determined in 2014 that financial distress at Metlife could significantly affect the national economy and therefore the company deserves increased federal scrutiny. The judge held, however, that such a designation was unsupported by substantial evidence and disregards the costs that Metlife will inevitably suffer. In February <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a> [corporate website] agreed to pay about $3.2 billion to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/823671/download">settle charges</a> [settlement agreement, PDF] that it misled investors in residential <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/morgan-stanley-agrees-to-32-billion-settlement-with-state-and-federal-authorities.php">mortgage-backed securities</a> [JURIST report]. In September the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] unveiled a new <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dag/file/769036/download">policy</a> [text, PDF] for white-collar crimes, which targets individuals accused of crimes <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/doj-announces-new-policy-for-prosecution-of-white-collar-crimes.php">instead of the companies</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2841394/Planned-Parenthood-Order.pdf">temporarily blocked</a> [order, PDF] an <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/ohio-governor-signs-bill-prohibiting-funding-for-abortion-providers.php">Ohio law</a> [JURIST report] defunding Planned Parenthood. The judge ruled in a <a href="http://ppfa.pr-optout.com/ViewAttachment.aspx?EID=mr9WXYw4u2IxYnni1dBRVhVz9V12NJvWMiaOFGvawXQ%3d">lawsuit</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/planned-parenthood-challenges-ohio-funding-restrictions.php">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] by Planned Parenthood on May 11 and issued a temporary two-week restraining order preventing state officials from terminating funding and declining to order the reinstatement of certain contracts "out of concern for disrupting ongoing care and services." The law was to take effect on May 23 and would divert approximately $1.3 million in state funding from the organization. </p>

<p>Planned Parenthood has recently been fighting against many laws seeking to defund the organization. In January US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-vetoes-health-care-repeal-bill.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood. In August Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/planned-parenthood-challengs-alabama-medicaid-funding-cuts.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, alleging that Alabama Governor Robert Bentley's termination of Medicaid provider agreements for the facility violates a federal law that requires Medicaid beneficiaries to have a choice in provider for family planning. Also in August the Alaska Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/alaska-court-strikes-down-abortion-law-limiting-medicaid-funding.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a state law it says would have unfairly burdened low-income individuals by limiting Medicaid funding for abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/05/24/remarks-president-obama-address-people-vietnam">delivered a speech</a> [text] in Vietnam Tuesday pressing the government on human rights concerns in the nation. Stating that he was not intending to single any one nation out, Obama commended Vietnam on its progress in recent years in committing "to bringing its laws in line with its new constitution and with international norms." He then discussed how more could be done and why it was necessary to uphold, what he called, "universal rights." He discussed how freedom of speech can lead to innovation and freedom of religion can allow "faith groups to serve their communities through schools and hospitals."  He further stated that "upholding these rights is not a threat to stability, but actually reinforces stability and is the foundation of progress" and "the fullest expression of the independence that so many cherish." During his speech, Obama also touched on how the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-expert-investor-state-dispute-settlement-incompatible-with-democracy.php">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> [JURIST report] will help the Vietnamese economy and strengthen the bond between the US and Vietnam. Obama ended on a note of optimism for the US and Vietnam to work together in the future.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese government has faced criticism from the international community over its human rights policies. In August 2014 the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief reported <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/un-official-claims-violations-of-religious-freedom-persist-in-vietnam.php">serious violations</a> [JURIST report] of religious freedom persist in Vietnam. In March of that year the Hanoi Supreme People's Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/vietnam-jails-blogger-for-criticizing-government.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] blogger Oham Viet Dao to 15 months in prison for posting articles criticizing the government. A month earlier the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/vietnam-appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-activist-lawyer.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of US-trained lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a known anti-government activist. In the autumn of 2013 <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ai-accuses-vietnam-of-repressive-laws.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Vietnamese authorities of using repressive laws against anti-government activists and <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/hrw-urges-vietnam-to-protect-human-rights-in-constitutional-amendments.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.na.gov.vn/htx/English/C1330/#fr06aJRGpvTU">National Assembly of Vietnam</a> [government website, in English] to bring the country's constitution in line with international human rights standards. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wisconsin Court of Appeals on Tuesday <a href="http://watchdog.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/05/May-24-2016-order-granting-stay-request.pdf">stayed</a> [order, PDF] a lower court's decision striking down Wisconsin's  <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2015/related/acts/1">"right to work" law</a> [text]. Judge William Foust of the Dane County Circuit Court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/judge-strikes-down-wisconsin-law-on-union-dues.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law that would bar unions from reaching agreements to force private-sector workers to pay the equivalent of union dues, later refusing to stay his decision. In a five-page order Tuesday, the appeals court blocked the ruling pending appeal:<blockquote>We conclude the circuit court examined the relevant facts, applied the proper standard of law, and well articulated the basis for its decision to deny the stay pending appeal. However, we determine the court's conclusion the Unions would suffer substantial harm if a stay was imposed pending appeal is not supported by the court's factual findings and the record. As a result, the court erroneously exercised its discretion in according that factor more weight in its analysis. Given a relative lack of harm shown to either party or the public interest, the presumption of constitutionality of this duly enacted statute and the preference under the law to maintain the status quo to avoid confusion, we conclude the State has established there is sufficient likelihood of success on appeal to warrant the grant of the stay.</blockquote>The Wisconsin Department of Justice welcomed Tuesday's decision, <a href="https://www.doj.state.wi.us/news-releases/wisconsin-doj-statement-response-new-development-wisconsin%E2%80%99s-right-work-lawsuit">stating</a> [press release], "[w]e feel confident the law will ultimately be found constitutional, as it has been in more than half the States across the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wisconsin <a href="http://walker.wi.gov/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-right-to-work-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the right to work bill into law in March of last year, making Wisconsin the twenty-fifth state with such a law on the books. It faced immediate <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/wisconsin-unions-file-first-lawsuit-against-new-right-to-work-law-dnp.php">legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.wisaflcio.org/">Wisconsin AFL-CIO</a> [union website] and two local labor unions.

		<title>Federal judge rules Ohio early voting cuts unconstitutional</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2841961/Final-Order-Ohio.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the 2014 elimination of the state's early in-person (EIP) voting was unconstitutional and in violation of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [DOJ materials]. While the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] reached a settlement agreement in April 2015 reinstating one day of Sunday voting and providing <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/aclu-reaches-settlement-with-ohio-over-early-voting.php">evening hours on weekdays</a> [JURIST report], the so-called "Golden Week" process was not reinstated as part of that agreement. Golden Week is "a period of time in which Ohioans could both register and vote on the same day." This helps create more opportunity for voters who may not have the time or resources to register and vote on separate days, as well as providing more voting time to prevent long lines. Judge Michael Watson stated in his decision:<blockquote>The elimination of the extra days for EIP voting provided by Golden Week will disproportionately burden African Americans, as expert and anecdotal evidence reflects that African Americans vote EIP, and specifically EIP during Golden Week, at a significantly higher rate than other voters. ... [Additionally,] it may be more difficult for voters with time, resource, transportation, and childcare restraints to make two separate trips to register and vote, and Golden Week allowed individuals to do both at once. ... The elimination of [same-day registration] means that voters must now register and vote at separate times, which increases the "cost of voting," especially for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.</blockquote>Statistical and anecdotal evidence cited by Watson showed support for the claims that African Americans utilized this procedure greater than other groups, and that the elimination of this inevitably places a disproportionate burden on them to the point of violating constitutional rights and the VRA.</p>

<p>Ohio was also in voting news in March when a judge for Ohio's <a href="https://www.fccourts.org/gen/WebFront.nsf/wp/A871F0A56A9103A4852574F2001ED82D?opendocument">Franklin County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] granted an <a href="https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/judge-fryes-final-opinion.pdf">emergency order</a> [text, PDF] allowing 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November election to vote in the Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-judge-allows-some-17-year-olds-may-vote-in-primaries.php">primary</a> [JURIST report]. However, voting rights remain a controversial legal topic across the entire US. Last week a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="https://doc-0s-74-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/8aap6obm338o2ntg142hof31i2u3tpso/1463767200000/15285364390221237946/*/0Bzgzy2KXyxqtMHc4elJtV2VDUHc?e=download">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. Earlier last month a federal appeals court held that a Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. In March a federal appeals court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state. In March of last year Oregon Governor Kate Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/oregon-adopts-automatic-voter-registration.php">signed a new law</a> [JURIST report] that made Oregon the first state in the nation to institute automatic voter registration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/eu-halt-arms-transfers-to-egypt-to-stop-fuelling-killings-and-torture/">urged</a> [press release] EU officials to adhere to a 2013 suspension on arms transfers with Egypt in order to prevent human rights violations. According to AI, the suspension was put in place "after <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-experts-urge-immediate-end-to-violence-in-egypt.php">hundreds of protesters were killed</a> [JURIST report] in a show of grossly excessive force by security forces in August 2013," but a dozen member states are still participating in arms deals with the country. AI pointed out the reckless nature of transferring all types of weapons to Egypt with no assurance of how they will be used despite the vast evidence of human rights violations. AI also stated that by continuing to provide weapons to Egypt, member states are risking complicity in the country's actions. Adding to the suspension being ignored, there is also talk among member states of abandoning the suspension altogether following "last year's decision by the USA to resume military aid to Egypt to the tune of $1.3 billion annually." AI stands against this, calling on the EU and all member states to:<blockquote>Impose and fully implement a binding embargo on transfers of security and policing equipment to Egypt...Impose a 'presumption of denial' policy on transfers of arms intended for use by Egypt's armed forces and air force...Maintain this embargo and 'presumption of denial' policy until the Egyptian authorities put in place effective safeguards to prevent further serious violations by security forces.</blockquote>AI cited the <a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/att/">Arms Trade Treaty</a> [UN materials] and the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:335:0099:0103:EN:PDF">EU's Common Position on arms exports</a> [text, PDF] as supporting a suspension to prevent and deter Egypt's actions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC profile] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Earlier this month Egyptian officials announced the conviction and prison sentences of over one hundred demonstrators who were peacefully assembling <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egyptian-courts-sentence-protesters-to-five-years-in-prison.php">without a permit</a> [JURIST report]. Also this month three UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-egypt-must-end-crackdown-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. In early May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts urged Egypt to cease its cease [JURIST report] its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.stockholmstingsratt.se/">Stockholm District Court</a> [official website, in Swedish] <a href="http://www.stockholmstingsratt.se/Om-tingsratten/Nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/Julian-Assange-remains-detained-in-absentia/">upheld the arrest warrant</a> [press release] for Julian Assange on Wednesday, finding he was not illegally detained in absentia. Assange has been held on <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-sweden-assange-idUSKCN0YG11N">allegations of rape</a> [Reuters report] dating back to 2010. The court found there was probable cause to support the accusation. Assange has been at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for over three years. He fears that Sweden's efforts to extradite him will result in extradition to the US due to the fact that his company, WikiLeaks, released thousands of classified government documents. However, he has not been charged in the US. </p>

<p>WikiLeaks, and its founder Assange, have created significant controversy since the website began openly publishing government secrets. Last May the Swedish Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/sweden-top-court-rejects-assange-appeal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an appeal by Assange seeking to overturn a 2010 arrest warrant for alleged sexual assault that was <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/swedish-appeals-court-reissues-arrest-warrant-for-julian-assange.php">reissued</a> [JURIST report] by a lower court in late 2014. The warrant requires Assange to leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has found asylum and travel to Sweden in order to be questioned about the allegations. The <a href="/forum/2011/06/ashley-savage-whistleblowing.php">WikiLeaks documents</a> [JURIST op-ed] have also garnered much debate in the US. Last year US Army Major General Jeffery Buchanan <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/army-general-denies-chelsea-mannings-request-for-clemency.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Private Chelsea Manning's conviction and prison sentence for turning over classified information to WikiLeaks. In September 2013 Manning filed for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports] she received in August. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spokesperson for the UN human rights office <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20012&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Gaza authorities to end the use of the death penalty on Wednesday. Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the office is "deeply concerned about recent statements made by the authorities in Gaza, including the Attorney General, of their intention to implement a number of death sentences, and fear that the first executions may be imminent." The UN feels that Gaza's standard in execution cases is lacking and are concerned of reports that these executions are to be held in public places. </p>

<p>Executions in Gaza have been an international concern previously. In August 2013 Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/hrw-hamas-must-end-death-penalty-for-child-offenders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] authorities in Gaza to halt all executions, especially those of child offenders. Also in 2013, then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-urges-hamas-to-end-executions-in-gaza.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Hamas not to go through with the executions. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/psindex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories</a> [official website] called on <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13455&LangID=E">Israel</a> [statement] to end its blockade of the Gaza Strip in June 2013. Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip has been a subject of <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">controversy</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials in 11 states filed a <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842656/11-States-Sue-Obama-Admin.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday in the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] challenging the Obama administration's recent <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights">guidance letter</a> [press release] on  transgender students. The states&#8212;Texas, Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah, and Georgia&#8212;as well as the Arizona Department of Education and the governor of Maine assert 10 claims against the guidance provided by the administration earlier this month, ranging from procedural claims to constitutional arguments. According to the plaintiffs, the "new Rules, Regulations, Guidance and Interpretations at Issue":<blockquote>Are Being Imposed Without Observance of Procedure Required by Law ... Are Unlawful by Exceeding Congressional Authorization ... Are Unlawful by Violating the Tenth Amendment ... Are Unlawful by Violating the Fourteenth Amendment ... Unlawfully Attempt to Abrogate State Sovereign Immunity... Are Arbitrary and Capricious ... Are Unlawful and Violate Constitutional Standards of Clear Notice ...Are Unlawful and Unconstitutionally Coercive ... [and] Were Issued Without a Proper Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.</blockquote>The plaintiffs are seeking declarations that the guidance is unlawful based on any reason asserted, as well as a preliminary injunction preventing enforcement and a resulting permanent injunction to prevent the letter from ever having legal effect.</p>

<p>Rights of transgender individuals have become a hot button issue globally. Last week the Oklahoma legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/oklahoma-lawmakers-request-articles-of-impeachment-against-obama.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] asking Congress to impeach President Barack Obama over his administration's guidance on ensuring the protection and inclusion of transgender individuals in federal civil rights law. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] legislation last week that would ban transgender discrimination, including it within Canada's hate crime laws. Also last week the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), along with several other organizations, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-seeks-to-block-north-carolina-hb2.php">asked a federal court</a> [JURIST report] to block the enforcement of a North Carolina law that they claim targets transgender people for discrimination. The Massachusetts Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/massachusetts-senate-passes-transgender-rights-bill.php">advanced</a> [JURIST report] legislation earlier this month aimed at protecting transgender individuals from discrimination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Carolina <a href="http://governor.sc.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Nikki Haley</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/query.php?search=DOC&searchtext=pain%20capable&category=LEGISLATION&session=121&conid=8206598&result_pos=0&keyval=1213114&numrows=10">signed a bill</a> [H 3114 materials] on Wednesday banning abortions at the 20-week mark, making it the seventeenth state to pass such a ban. The bill, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-20-week-abortion-ban.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-carolina-20-week-abortion_us_57461464e4b03ede4413c138">includes exceptions</a> [Huffington Post report] only for protecting the mother's health and a fetal anomaly, meaning "in reasonable medical judgment, the unborn child has a profound and irremediable congenital or chromosomal anomaly that, with or without the provision of life-preserving treatment, would be incompatible with sustaining life after birth." Although it does not provide exceptions for rape or incest, the bill follows along with the idea of the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/36">Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HR 36 materials], which claims that evidence exists showing unborn fetuses feel pain at the 20-week mark, although the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still holds to a 2005 study <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/25/politics/sc-abortion-bill/">showing the contrary</a> [CNN report]. South Carolina's law will also make it a misdemeanor for doctors to break the law, with possibilities of a fine and up to three years in prison.</p>

<p>Abortion remains controversial across the US, with state legislatures continuing to pass various regulations. Last week the Oklahoma Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/oklahoma-legislature-approves-bill-criminalizing-abortion.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would criminalize performing abortions, although Governor Mary Fallin later vetoed the bill. Also last week the Louisiana state Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-legislature-bans-controversial-abortion-procedure.php">approved a bill banning</a> [JURIST report] dilation and evacuation abortion procedures. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. Also in March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a Texas law that would require abortion clinics to upgrade facilities to hospital-like standards and would require doctors to have admitting privileges at local hospitals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] published a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/POL3040622016ENGLISH.PDF">policy statement</a> [text; PDF] on Wednesday calling for the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/amnesty-international-publishes-policy-and-research-on-protection-of-sex-workers-rights/">decriminalization of sex workers</a> [press release]. Stating that, "[s]ex workers are at heightened risk of a whole host of human rights abuses including rape, violence, extortion and discrimination," AI called for governments to "do more to protect people who do sex work from violations and abuse." AI's comprehensive policy called on governments to, among other things, "decriminalize consensual sex work, including those laws that prohibit associated activities&#8212;such as bans on buying, solicitation and general organization of sex work;" "[e]nsure the meaningful participation of sex workers in the development of law and policies that directly affect their lives and safety; [r]efocus laws away from catch-all offences that criminalize most or all aspects of sex work and towards laws and policies that protect sex workers&#8217; health and safety and that oppose all acts of exploitation and trafficking in commercial sex (including of children);  [e]nsure that there are effective frameworks and services that allow people to leave sex work if and when they choose; and [e]nsure that sex workers have equal access to justice, health care and other public services, and to equal protection under the law." AI also published four independent research reports on the sex work situation in <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA3440302016ENGLISH.PDF">Papa New Guinea</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ASA1740322016ENGLISH.PDF">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR3640342016ENGLISH.PDF">Norway</a>, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AMR1340422016ENGLISH.PDF">Argentina</a> [reports; PDF]. AI's research in these and other countries indicate that sex workers are often afforded very little or no protection from abuse or legal redress, and also often have very little or no access to much needed health care "even in countries where the act of selling sex itself is legal." According to AI, criminalization enables the police to harass sex workers and not prioritize their complaints and safety. AI's Senior Director for Law and Policy, Tawanda Mutasah, stated that "[t]his situation can never be justified. Governments must act to protect the human rights of all people, sex workers included. Decriminalization is just one of several necessary steps governments can take to ensure protection from harm, exploitation and coercion."</p>

<p>The decriminalization of sex work continues to be a matter of considerable controversy in many countries. Most countries continue to impose heavy criminal penalties on sex workers. Last month, the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">French Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/France-parliament-passes-anti-prostitution-bill.php">passed legislation</a> [JURIST report] which will make it illegal to pay for sex within the nation. In March the <a href="http://english.ccourt.go.kr/cckhome/eng/index.do">Constitutional Court of South Korea</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-korea-court-upholds-anti-prostitution-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that punishes individual sex workers. The South Korean high court called prostitution "violent and exploitative in nature," and stated that it was inherently non-coercive. In 2011, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] agreed to review a <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">British Columbia Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/canada-high-court-to-review-anti-prostitution-laws.php">allowing a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the country's anti-prostitution laws. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.ca/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> (OSCJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Canada's anti-prostitution laws, citing the danger they generate for sex workers. In Canada, prostitution itself is legal even though many ancillary acts are not. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Constitutional Court of Taiwan</a> [official website; Taiwanese] ruled that a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/taiwan-high-court-rules-prostitution.php">law penalizing prostitutes</a> [JURIST report] and not their clients was unconstitutional because it undermined equality under the country's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] ruled Thursday that Salvatore Girone, the Italian marine under investigation for the killing of two fisherman, is free to go home while India and Italy await the decision of the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] in The Hague. The <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/india-italy-marine-supreme-court-girone-idINKCN0YH0DP">decision</a> [Reuters report] comes within a month of a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-arbitration-tribunal-rules-in-favor-of-italian-marine-in.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] by India's Ministry of External Affairs that it would allow Salvatore Girone to return home pending the Supreme Court's adjudication of the case. This decision sparked the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/congress-government-unjust-to-families-of-deceased-fishermen-2820882/">ire</a> [Indian Express report] of the <a href="http://www.inc.in/">Indian National Congress</a>, which accused <a href="http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> [official websites] of having an underhanded deal with his Italian counterpart for not objecting to the Supreme Court's relaxation of Girone's bail conditions. The court conditioned Girone's release on the surrender of his passport to the Italian government upon his return to the country and ordered that he will be required to return to India within a month of any order from the tribunal in favor of the government of India. Despite the Italian foreign ministry's satisfaction with the Court's decision, the Indian government has expressed confidence that the tribunal will ultimately rule in its favor.</p>

<p>The "Enrica Lexie Incident" took place in 2012 when two Italian marines, Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, <a href="www.dnaindia.com/india/report-fishermen-killing-italian-ship-enrica-lexie-sails-off-kerala-waters-1684893">shot and killed two Indian fishermen</a> [DNA India report], Ajesh Binki and Valentine, believing them to be pirates. The killing sparked international controversy, and also created questions regarding jurisdiction. Last year the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.24_prov_meas/C24_Order_24.08.2015_orig_Eng.pdf">ordered India</a> [order, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/tribunal-orders-india-to-suspend-trial-of-italy-marines.php">suspend the trial</a> [JURIST report] of the two Italian marines. In July the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-italy-marines-idUSKCN0PN1MK20150713">India Supreme Court heard</a> [Reuters report] a plea from Italy challenging India's jurisdiction. In 2012 Rome compensated the victims' families with $190,000, and the families dropped their cases against the marines, but the state did not follow suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Louisiana <a href="http://www.johnbelforlouisiana.com/">Governor John Bel Edwards</a> [official website] on Thursday signed into law an amended <a href="https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=990021&version=meter+at+5&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click">hate crime bill</a> [text, PDF] including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. Proponents of this bill have stated that the addition was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/louisiana-enacts-hate-crimes-law-to-protect-a-new-group-police.html">necessary</a> [NYT report] to protect against "deliberate campaign[s] to terrorize" police officers. In particular, the recent anti-police sentiment following the police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner was a driving force behind the amended legislation. Despite claims that the bill is only meant to protect officers, the bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement, as "dilut[ing] the basic meaning of hate crimes" and "undermin[ing] the movement protesting the use of force by the police." According to the <a href="http://www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/?version=meter%20at%205&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click?referrer=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/louisiana-enacts-hate-crimes-law-to-protect-a-new-group-police.html">National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund</a> [official website], there have been no police fatalities in Louisiana so far in 2016.</p>

<p>This legislation comes at a time where police use of force has been questioned on a national scale. Last week a Baltimore police officer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/baltimore-police-officer-acquitted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who was injured in police custody and later died. Earlier this year the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the DOJ announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/CR321/321CR119.pdf">ruled 5-2</a> [opinion, PDF] to uphold the state's ban on capital punishment. The decision, which rested upon the court's <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/connecticut-supreme-court-rules-existing-death-penalty-sentences-unconstitutional.php">previous decision</a> [JURIST report] against capital punishment, stated once again that allowing the death penalty would be against the state's constitution and prior state legislation. In reversing the two death sentences imposed upon Russel Peeler, the court remanded the case and instructed the lower court to impose a sentence of life in prison without possibility of release. Peeler had <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/The-murderous-saga-of-Russell-Peeler-4723170.php">ordered the murder</a> [<em>Connecticut Post</em> report] of Leroy "BJ" Brown, a child that had witnessed Peeler murder his father, and his mother, Karen Clarke, in 1999.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Earlier this month the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-blocks-alabama-execution.php">upheld a stay</a> [JURIST report] on the execution of a mentally incompetent Alabama inmate. Last month Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/south-sudan-dozens-of-detainees-at-risk-of-death-in-shipping-containers/">reported</a> [press release] Friday. According to AI, the citizens are currently being held in "poorly ventilated metal shipping containers, fed only once or twice a week and given insufficient," and are periodically taken out of the containers and beaten. Muthoni Wanyeki, AI Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and Great Lakes, said the conditions as "nothing short of torture" and stated that "the detention site should be immediately shut down until conditions are brought into compliance with human rights standards." Most of those detained have reportedly not been charged with an offense, but are only accused of having ties to the former rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army-in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and are being denied access to family members, lawyers and courts. AI has reached out to several high ranking South Sudani officials, including Major-General Marial Nour, Director of Military Intelligence, and President Salva Kiir, informing them of the conditions at the Gorom detention site and asking for an intervention and investigation into the human rights violations. This news comes after AI <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/05/south-sudan-dozens-of-detainees-at-risk-of-death-in-shipping-containers/">detailed similar human rights violations</a> [AI briefing] in Leer, Unity State, in October.</p>

<p>Prisoners are an at-risk population throughout the world. Earlier this month, Nils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/europe-rights-chief-denounces-belgium-prison-conditions.php">criticized Belgium</a> [JURIST report] for the deteriorating conditions of its prisons. Last month Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-france-prisons-neglecting-inmates-mental-health.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that France prisons were neglecting inmates' mental health. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Louisiana jails are failing to provide basic HIV services to inmates. HRW also found that Baton Rouge and New Orleans&#8212;the state's two largest cities&#8212;lead the nation in HIV infections every year and the state also leads the nation in rates of incarceration. The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] have been matters of ongoing concern in the US with two groups in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-louisiana-prisons-not-providing-basic-hiv-services.php">detailing</a> [JURIST report] recommendations for criminal justice reform in that state earlier last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US jury concluded that Google was not in violation of copyright laws where it used Oracle's Java programming language to develop its operating system, Android. After the case was remanded in-part by an <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/11/10/oracle_v_google_13-1021.opinion.5-7-2014.1.pdf">earlier circuit court decision</a> [decision, PDF], the jurors were tasked with determining whether Google's use of the Java language was considered "fair-use" under copyright law. The victory for Google, which will eliminate Oracle's claim for $9 billion of Google's Android phone business, serves to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-26/google-beats-oracle-copyright-suit-wiping-away-9-billion-claim">encourage</a> [Bloomberg report] software companies to write "re-implementations of the systems used to pass information between widely-used software," as they will not, as of now, have to fear the legal repercussions. Despite this victory for those seeking to use re-implemented programming language, the previous decision, which had remanded the issue of fair-use in this case, may still make some take precaution. In that case, the circuit court held that Java APIs were granted copyright protection.</p>

<p>In 2012 a judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-orders-oracle-to-pay-google-1-million-in-court-costs.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Oracle to reimburse Google about $1 million for costs incurred during the course of the companies' recent patent litigation. Earlier that year a federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-jury-finds-for-google-in-dispute-with-oracle.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that Google's use of the application programming interfaces was not an infringement of Oracle's patents. Earlier that month the jury <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-jury-reaches-impasse-in-google-oracle-dispute.php">found itself deadlocked</a> [JURIST report] on the issue of whether Google's use could be considered "fair use" making it difficult for Oracle to win a large damage award. The case <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/oracle-google-set-to-head-to-court-over-android-os.php">went to trial</a> [JURIST report] after settlement negotiations broke down. This most recent decision was preceded by the 2014 ruling in which the circuit court <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-oracle-in-dispute-with-google.php">allowed Oracle to bring its case</a> [JURIST report] against Google.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South Africa's <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.za/">Parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday approved a <a href="https://jutalaw.co.za/media/filestore/2015/02/B04_2015.pdf">bill</a> [materials, PDF] to allow government expropriation of land. The bill will serve to allow a government adjudicator to value a particular piece of land and then expropriate it for the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/south-africa-passes-controversial-land-ownership-law-160527033515636.html">public interest</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> [official website] hopes that the enactment will redress the inequality created by apartheid and place more land in possession of black citizens. While some are heralding the new legislation as bringing justice to South Africans some farming organizations and economists are <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0YH20L">criticizing</a> [Reuters report] the reform, pointing to the effects of a similar measure in Zimbabwe and the lack of clarity in regards to the actual seizure process. As of now, 10 percent of land owned by the white population has been transferred to black owners, only one-third of the government's target goal.</p>

<p>South African <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17450447">President Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile] recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-president-zuma-beats-impeachment.php">survived a vote to impeach</a> [JURIST report] him after the ANC gave him their support. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the constitutional court ruled that he had ignored their <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">order</a> [JURIST report] to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence. Zuma, a controversial figure in South African politics, was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but he was ultimately acquitted and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as ANC deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justice and accountability are crucial aspects of achieving and maintaining peace in Libya, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/otp_report_lib_26052016-eng.pdf">told</a> [ICC report, PDF] the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] Thursday. She also <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54060#.V0hxS_krLIU">encouraged</a> [UN News Centre report] the Libyan government to create effective strategies for handling atrocities and to invest in institutions responsible for managing those strategies. Despite being faced with the challenges associated with lacking sufficient resources, Bensouda was hopeful for the nation's future because of the signing of a UN-backed Agreement in 2015, along with the encouraging response and cooperation by the Libyan Prosecutor-General's office. Bensouda called upon all relevant resources, national and international, to support the Libyan government in their on-going efforts to deter terrorism and protect the nation from instability. In her report, the prosecutor also addressed the detention of Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi, the migrant crisis throughout the nation and concern for the well-being of civilians. </p>

<p>Libya has remained politically unstable since the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 deposition of Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war. The internationally-recognized Libyan Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/libya-parliament-rejects-unity-government.php">voted </a>[JURIST report] in January to reject a proposal by the UN-supported unity government to curb the country's political crisis. In March of last year the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] released a report outlining a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-libya-mission-unveils-peace-proposal.php">peace proposal</a> [JURIST report] intending to end the country's political instability and "deteriorating military situation." Also in March, the head of the UNSMIL warned the UN Security Council that without intervention from the international community and UN, <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-expert-libya-situation-deteriorating-rapidly.php">Libya is likely to become unstable</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of repeated terrorist attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] More than 2,000 inmates across Zimbabwe were granted amnesty and released from prison due to overcrowding and a lack of food, according to a <a href="http://www.herald.co.zw/president-pardons-over-2-000-inmates/">report</a> [<em>The Herald</em> report] Thursday. President Robert Mugabe, who extended the pardon under the Constitution of Zimbabwe on May 23, hopes that this measure will serve to remedy overcrowding and promote better living conditions for prisoners. The pardon granted freedom to all female prisoners that were not currently serving life sentences, all juvenile prisoners, regardless of the seriousness of their offense, "as well as all prisoners with life sentences convicted on or before December 25, 1995" among other groups. Those other individuals convicted of murder, treason, rape, armed robbery, car-jacking, sexual offenses, or violence driven crimes will remain in prison, along with habitual criminals and those currently facing death sentences or that were given life sentences after December 25, 1995. Scores of inmates in Zimbabwe over the past decade have <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/27/479726288/zimbabwe-pardons-thousands-of-prisoners-because-of-overcrowding-food-shortages">died due to "nutrition-related illnesses</a> [NPR report].</p>

<p>In April 2015, the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] announced that <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-drugs-and-crime-office-spotlights-prison-overcrowding-epidemic.php">prison overcrowding has reached "epidemic proportions"</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. Later that year, the UN torture prevention body <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-experts-urge-philippines-to-deal-with-prison-overcrowding.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Philippines to address the pressing concern of prison overcrowding. In July 2014 the French Senate <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/france-lawmakers-adopt-measure-to-reduce-prison-overcrowding.php">adopted a measure</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to reduce prison overcrowding. In August 2013 the Italian Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/italy-parliament-approves-measure-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">approved a measure</a> [JURIST report] to ease some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe by cutting pre-trial detentions and using alternative punishments for minor offenses. The move came after the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/eu-court-rules-italy-prison-overcrowding-violates-rights.php">ordered Italy to address the problem</a> [JURIST report] within a year. In August 2012 the Colombian Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/colombia-transfers-inmates-to-solve-prison-overcrowding-problem.php">announced a new initiative</a> [JURIST report] to solve the problem of overcrowding in the nation's prisons. In June 2012 UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Kyung-wha Kang <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-official-urges-malawi-to-improve-human-rights-conditions-accountability.php">urged the government of Malawi</a> [JURIST report] to address the problem of prison overcrowding and improve the human rights condition in the country. In April 2012 South Africa <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/south-africa-president-pardons-35000-offenders-to-ease-prison-overcrowding.php">announced that it would issue pardons</a> [JURIST report] to 35,000 offenders in order to ease prison overcrowding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The High Court in Uganda on Friday handed down five life sentences for men convicted of perpetrating the 2010 Kampala attacks, which killed 76 people. The court also gave two 50-year terms, and one community service <a href="http://staging.hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_UGANDA_WORLD_CUP_BOMBINGS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-05-27-12-42-43">sentence</a> [AP report] associated with the attacks. Five other men who had been standing trial for the attacks were acquitted. Charges for those convicted ranged from terrorism to accessory to terrorism. Prosecutors had asked for the death sentence on the higher charges. However, High Court Judge, Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, did not believe the death sentence would be useful to <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-uganda-attacks-sentence-idUKKCN0YI1OY">bringing closure to society</a> [Reuters report]. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/12/uganda-kampala-bombs-explosions-attacks">bombings</a> [<em>Guardian </em>report] took place in the capital city of Uganda while spectators gathered at a restaurant and a rugby club to watch the World cup finals. The attacks were claimed by <a href="https://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/al_shabaab.html">al Shabaab</a> [NCTC backgrounder], a Somalian affiliate of al Qaeda. The group said the attacks were in response to the 2007 Africa Union Mission deployment of Ugandan troops in Somalia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/27/burma-proposed-assembly-law-falls-short">urged</a> [official report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that they say has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly. HRW acknowledged that the proposed law would replace a more restrictive law that had previously imprisoned activists, but said that the statute under consideration still contains shortcomings that could be overcome by consultation with legal experts, bringing the law within international standards of speech and assembly. According to HRW Asia Director Brad Adams, "[t]he government needs legal reforms that don&#8217;t just weaken the tools of repression, but removes them entirely."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-12990563">Myanmar</a> [BBC profile] replaced its decades-old military rule with ongoing democratic reform since 2011, following the military-government handing the reins over to a quasi-civilian government after successful civilian elections in 2010. Last month 69 <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/myanmar-releases-political-prisoners.php">political prisoners were released</a> [JURIST report] who had been jailed for more than a year without trial. In March <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-myanmar-has-a-historic-opportunity-to-change-course-on-human-rights.php">Amnesty International said</a> [JURIST report] that Myanmar's new government has been presented with an historic opportunity to change the course of human rights. Also in March <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">Myanmar released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military as part of a UN joint action plan. In January the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/myanmar-begins-releasing-political-prisoners.php">country began</a> [JURIST report] the process of releasing the first set of 102 mostly political prisoners days before a democratic power transfer took place.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54067#.V0iVe0uQnGs">warned</a> [UN News Centre report] Friday that the severe financial crisis facing the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] is negatively impacting its ability to function. Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the OHCHR issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20026&LangID=E">briefing</a> [press release] Fridaymorning in which she stated that if the IACHR does not receive additional funds, the ability of the rights systems currently in place to respond to potential violations could be severely curtailed. Shamdasani said, "[w]e urge States to reaffirm their commitment to human rights by providing the Commission with the required resources to fulfil its crucial mandate and indeed to strengthen this key institution. The Commission's robust defence of human rights in the region should be encouraged&#8212;not punished."</p>

<p>The IACHR is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States whose <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/mandate/what.asp">mission</a> [backgrounder] is to promote and protect human rights in the American hemisphere. The IACHR reported earlier this week that financial restraints will force it to <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2016/069.asp">lay off</a> [press release] nearly half of its staff at the end of July.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D05-26/C:15-2997:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:1760877:S:0">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that an employer may not coerce an employee to waive his or her right to bring a class action suit. In its decision, the court stated that section 7 of the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/resources/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> [materials] (NLRA) prevented Epic, the employer, from imposing its arbitration agreement upon its employees. The pertinent portion of the statute reads in part, "[e]mployees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities" for mutual benefit or aid. While Epic contested that "other concerted activities," which encompasses class-action suits, was an ambiguous phrase, the court stated that "the NLRA's history and purpose confirm that the phrase 'concerted activities...include resort to representative, joint, collective, or class legal remedies." The court asserted that, even if the phrase was ambiguous, the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relation's Board's</a> [official website] (NLRB) decisions regarding section 7 weigh heavily against Epic's interpretation of section 7, and the NLRB must be given deference. Finally, the court addressed and dismissed Epic's arguments that the <a href="http://www.sccinstitute.com/media/37104/the-federal-arbitration-act-usa.pdf">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text, PDF] may save its claim.</p>

<p>This decision creates a circuit split and may provide the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] incentive to rule on the matter. The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of arbitration with a class action waiver before, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rules-federal-arbitration-law-preempts-state-law.php">AT&T v. Concepcion</a> [JURIST report], a case in which the court held that states must uphold arbitration agreements with class-action waivers under the FAA, despite state law to the contrary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.iowacourts.gov/">Iowa Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/Supreme_Court_Opinions/Recent_Opinions/20160527/14-0455.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that juvenile convicted of first-degree murder may not be sentenced to life without parole. The court reasoned that sentencing a juvenile to life without parole was cruel and unusual punishment and emphasized that "sentencing courts should not be required to make speculative up-front decisions on juvenile offenders' prospects for rehabilitation." The court noted that it may be determined that an individual is beyond rehabilitation after time has passed, "after a record of success or failure in the rehabilitative process is available." The court also emphasized that parole was not guaranteed to juveniles, but rather only needs to be left available.</p>

<p>The decision reflects a growing consensus that children should, in some ways, be treated differently than adults, especially in regards to being sentenced for life. This understanding was elucidated in the recent Supreme Court decision, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/montgomery-v-louisiana/">Montgomery v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm">Alabama Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday vacated its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption. In its <a href="https://acis.alabama.gov/displaydocs.cfm?no=738772&event=4N80L4NS0">short opinion</a> [decision, PDF], the court stated that "the Court of Civil appeals and the Jefferson Family Court erred in giving full faith and credit" to a Georgia state court decision declaring the woman the adoptive parent of her then same-sex partner's children. The court had <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/cases-and-policy/cases-and-advocacy/case-e-l-v-v-l/">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] earlier this year that it would vacate its decision so long as it was determined that the "adoption decree appeared on its face to have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction." The US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-648_d18e.pdf">held that it was</a> [decision, PDF].</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage and adoption rights remain in a state of legal uncertainty despite the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] last June that states must allow same-sex marriage and recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. In March the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/alabama-supreme-court-dismisses-petitions-against-same-sex-marriage.php">dismissed petitions</a> that sought a ruling declaring the state's prohibition on <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">same-sex marriage valid</a> [JURIST reports]. Alabama <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/Bios/rmoore.cfm">Chief Justice Roy Moore</a> [official website] had instructed state judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">not to issue same-sex marriage licenses</a> [JURIST report] in January. The Alabama Supreme Court had ruled in March 2015 that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was legal, and Moore's order stated that ruling remained in effect despite the Supreme Court finding such bans unconstitutional. Moore's order had caused confusion among probate judges, with some defying the order and issuing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] licenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/">California Legislature</a> [official website] passed the bill earlier that day. Brown and the state's congress <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/latest-california-hiv-infected-organ-transplant-39433199">moved quickly</a> [AP report] to pass the emergency measure in order to permit an HIV-positive man to donate part of his liver to his HIV-positive husband before it becomes too late to save his life. In 2013, the federal government enacted legislation <a href="http://www.kcra.com/news/ca-law-allows-transplants-between-hivpositive-patients-donors/39770646">permitting</a> [KCRA report] transplants between HIV-infected individuals, but it remained a felony to do so in California.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Argentina's last dictator, Reynaldo Bignone, and other former military officers were <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2016/05/28/57494bd822601d54448b46a1.html">sentenced</a> [El Mundo report, in Spanish] to prison on Friday for their roles in Operation Condor in the <correction num=1>1970s</correction>. The criminal court in Buenos Aires, composed of judges Adrián Grünberg, Óscar Amirante, Pablo Laufer and Ricardo Ángel Basílico, handed Bignone a 20-year prison sentence on top of his previous prison sentences for crimes against humanity. The trial began with 22 defendants, but five died or were absolved. According to attorneys for advocacy groups, this was an important step in human rights because &#8220;it is the first time the existence of Operation Condor has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/argentinas-last-military-dictator-jailed-over-role-in-operation-condor">proved</a> [Guardian report] in court&#8221;. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/05/27/look-at-operation-condor-conspiracy-in-south-america.html">Operation Condor</a> [AP report] was a multi-state campaign that created and sanctioned death squads from South American countries to kidnap, torture and kill political opponents from each others&#8217; countries who had fled their country of origin. Evidence was produced during the trials that showed the US was aware of Operation Condor and played a role.</p>

<p>Former participants of former dictatorships of South America have been held accountable for their past crimes in the last decade. In February 2015, France's highest appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/france-high-court-stays-extradition-of-argentine-ex-police-officer.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to allow the extradition of a former police officer to Argentina for alleged crimes against humanity during the country's "dirty war." In October 2014, a Buenos Aires court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/argentina-ex-dictator-receives-additional-sentence.php">handed down</a> [JURIST report] a 23-year prison sentence to Reynaldo Bignone for the kidnapping and torture of 32 factory workers. In January 2014, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-rules-for-daimler-in-argentina-human-rights-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report]  in DaimlerChrysler AG (Daimler) v. Bauman that Daimler did not have to face suit in California for alleged human rights violations by a subsidiary that took place in Argentina during the nation's 1976-1983 "Dirty War." The Supreme Court of Chile <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/argentina-ex-dictator-receives-additional-sentence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] extradition of former Argentine Judge Otilio Romano for human rights crimes in 2013. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Mexican judge granted a <a href="http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2016/05/28/574965bcca4741d32a8b4643.html"> temporary suspension</a> [El Mundo report, in Spanish] on the extradition of Joaquín "el Chapo" Guzmán to the US on Saturday. The decision comes after Guzmán's lawyers <a href="http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/05/28/actualidad/1464396380_554549.html">filed</a> [El Pais report, in Spanish] an appeal arguing that extradition to the US would be unconstitutional. The Mexican foreign ministry had <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/05/24/attorney-mexican-drug-lord-will-skip-extradition-appeal-if-gets-us-deal/">approved</a> [Fox News report] the extradition of Guzmán so that he could be tried in US federal courts. The judge gave a "non-postponable" 48-hour window for the foreign ministry to present an argument that the extradition will comply with the extradition agreement. Furthermore, the judge provided that if the court does not receive the argument, the extradition decision will be reviewed by the justice department in June. </p>

<p>Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán was sentenced for conspiracy to distribute and import cocaine and kept in Mexico's highest security prison, Altiplano, in July. Guzmán escaped from prison that month and a federal official <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/mexico-arrests-seven-in-el-chapo-escape.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that seven of those who were being questioned regarding the prison escape were formally arrested. In August a Mexican judge temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/mexican-judge-suspends-us-extradition-order-for-chapo-guzman.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a US extradition order for Guzmán for an unknown reason and the escape increased tension in US-Mexico relations. In January Guzmán was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mexico-drug-lord-el-chapo-captured.php">recaptured</a> [JURIST report] in Los Mochis, Mexico after a Mexican-military raid left 5 suspects dead and one Mexican official injured. In May, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mexico-drug-lord-el-chapo-captured.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] and then Mexico's foreign ministry <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-approves-the-extradition-of-chapo-guzman/2016/05/20/fbf3dcee-1ebb-11e6-82c2-a7dcb313287d_story.html">approved</a> [WP report] Guzmán's extradition to the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The national <a href="http://mops.gov.il/english/policingeng/police/pages/default.aspx">Israeli Police</a> [official website] on Sunday <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.722077">recommended</a> [Haaretz report] that Sara Netanyahu, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, be indicted for improper behavior and misuse of state funds. The allegations include breach of trust, falsifying documents and receiving goods under false pretenses. Law enforcement officials <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Police-find-evidence-of-criminal-wrongdoing-by-Sara-Netanyahu-in-PM-residence-affair-455339">asserted</a> [Jerusalem Post report] that they have found enough evidence to indict the following: Sara Netanyahu, Deputy Director of the Prime Minister's office Ezra Saidoff and electrician Avi Fahima. The police official statement did not expressly <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/report-police-recommend-indicting-sara-netanyahu-over-pms-residence-charges/2016/05/29/">recount</a> [Jewish Press report] the evidentiary foundation for an indictment against the suspects. The Netanyahus have denied the allegations, including a separate case that alleged they received improper gifts when the prime minister served as finance minister in 2003. </p>

<p>The investigation into spending by the Netanyahus <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/police-recommend-sara-netanyahu-stand-trial-on-graft-allegations/">began</a> [Time Of Israel report] last year after a former custodian "successfully sued for damages after alleging abuse at the hands of Ms. Netanyahu" and a state comptroller report <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/middleeast/israeli-inquiry-faults-netanyahus-over-expenses.html?_r=0">criticized</a> [NYT report] their spending habits. In 2015, Israel's attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/israel-ag-orders-investigation-of-netanyahu-expenses.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a criminal probe into excessive residential spending by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This was not the first time an Israeli prime minister had gone through a criminal investigation. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/israel-ex-pm-convicted-of-bribery-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of accepting bribes relating to the construction of a luxury apartment complex called the Holyland Towers in 2014. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/Hard_drive.pdf">concluded</a> [opinion, PDF] that enforcement officials acted in good faith when they retained and searched copies of electronic files seized during a separate investigation that took place years before. In U.S. v. Ganias, Stavros Ganias <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/united-states-v-ganias">argued</a> [case documents] against his 2011 tax-evasion conviction asserting that the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizures <a href="https://epic.org/amicus/ganias/">prohibits</a> [EPIC report] the government from retaining and searching evidence "not covered by the original warrant." The Second Circuit had initially <a href="https://epic.org/amicus/ganias/Ganias-Panel-Opinion.pdf">ruled</a> in Ganias' favor, then <a href="https://epic.org/amicus/ganias/Ganias-En-Banc-Order.pdf">granted</a> [orders, PDF] this en banc appeal. The court decided that investigators acted in good faith when they searched Ganias' hard drives, which were seized pursuant to a 2006 warrant, because there was an absence of court rulings or law regarding the issue at the time. Although, the court <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2016/05/27/hard-drives-seized-years-ago-can-be-searched-court-says/">did not reach</a> [WSJ report] the Fourth Amendment issue, it suggested that they still would have rejected Ganias's 'right to deletion' argument. Justice Chin, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/dissent_hard_drive.pdf">argued</a> [dissent, PDF] that the "protections of the Fourth Amendment are even more important in the context of modern technology [because] the government has a far greater ability to intrude into a person's private affairs". Justice Chin maintained that the investigators' actions were not excused by the good faith exception even if investigators did not violate Ganias's Fourth Amendment rights when it retained and reexamined his files for evidence of additional crimes.</p>

<p>Changes in technology continue to raise important privacy questions. In April, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-approves-search-warrant-rule-change.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a rule change that would permit US judges to issue search warrants granting access to computers in any jurisdiction. Also last month, Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/microsoft-sues-doj-over-customer-email-privacy.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the US Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding the privacy of their customers' emails. In February, Apple Inc. <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-asks-congress-to-create-expert-panel-on-privacy-issues.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US government to create a panel of experts to discuss issues of security versus privacy after the emergence of a legal conflict between law enforcement the company. Last November, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/microsoft-sues-doj-over-customer-email-privacy.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a case to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when a law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2016/5/57480cb89/greece-unhcr-concerned-conditions-new-refugee-sites-urges-alternatives.html">expressed concern</a> [press release] over the poor living conditions of several refugee camps located in northern Greece. Refugees were recently <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2016/5/57484e9f0/unhcr-flags-concerns-refugee-sites-northern-greece.html">transferred</a> [official report] to the sites of concern after being properly evacuated from the makeshift camp at Idomeni, located on the Greek border. While it was agreed that evacuation was a necessary action, the UNHRC deplored the lack of toilets, showers, electricity, air circulation, food, water and aid in the new camps, in violation of basic human rights. Refugees echoed the UNHRC's concerns, stating that the new camps do not adequately provide basic requirements. The UNHRC is currently cooperating with the Alternate Minister of Interior to improve conditions where possible and find alternatives that meet humanitarian standards. </p>

<p>The rights of refugee and migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. Last month, several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to stop detaining asylum seekers. Also last month, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the first deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was "riddled with an array of irregularities." This deportation is significant, as it gives the EU cause for concern over Turkey's respect for human rights, and earlier in April the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments. In addition, last month, an independent UN human rights expert encouraged EU leaders to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">remain steadfast</a> [JURIST report] in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU and to avoid making Turkey the "gatekeeper"</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.casd.uscourts.gov/SitePages/Home.aspx">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/TrumpUniversity.pdf">ordered</a> [order, PDF] Republican presidential nominee <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Donald Trump</a> [political website] on Friday to release internal documents pertaining to Trump University, the terminated education program that is currently the focus of two class action lawsuits. The suits were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/judge-orders-release-of-internal-trump-university-documents/2016/05/28/2e960e5e-24f9-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html">brought</a> [WP report] by two San Diego students who accused Trump University of making false promises to those that enrolled. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/">Washington Post</a> [official website] intervened in the case and requested the court to unseal exhibits of public interest by way of the First Amendment right of access. Judge Gonzalo Curiel granted the Post's request, finding that Trump's status as the Republican front-runner of the 2016 presidential election places "the integrity of [the] court proceedings at issue." While Trump argued that the release of trade secrets and business playbooks would damage the possibility of revitalizing the program, Curiel found that such assertions were not well supported. In response to the order, Trump expressed concern that the judge issued a politically biased determination. Curiel has currently set a trial date for November to settle the matter.</p>

<p>Trump University was a real-estate educational program that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/28/politics/trump-university-donald-trump-documents/">operated</a> [CNN report] from 2005 until its closing in 2010. Though the program had no physical location and was not licensed as an educational institution, it enrolled an estimated 10,000 students in classes geared towards achieving business success. In 2013, New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about-attorney-general">Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/nyregion/new-york-attorney-generals-suit-against-trump-university-may-proceed-court-rules.html">brought</a> [NYT backgrounder] a $40 million lawsuit against Trump University accusing the program of defrauding over 5,000 students. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in Senegal convicted former Chadian dictator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5140818.stm">Hissène Habré</a> [BBC profile] of crimes against humanity committed during his rule from 1982 to 1990 and sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday. He was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36411466">found guilty</a> [BBC report] of sex slavery, rape and the ordered killings of an estimated 40,000 people. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] lawyer Reed Brody, who initiated the trial, <a href="https://twitter.com/ReedBrody/status/737247703097303040">stated</a> [official Twitter]:<blockquote>This verdict sends a powerful message that the days when tyrants could brutalize their people, pillage their treasury and escape abroad to a life of luxury are coming to an end. Today will be carved into history as the day that a band of unrelenting survivors brought their dictator to justice.</blockquote> This trial marks the first time a court with backing from the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website] has tried a former ruler for human rights violations, and also the first time a former African head of state was found guilty by an another African country. Habré has fifteen days to appeal the sentence.</p>

<p>Habré, who fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/former-chad-dictator-charged-with-war-crimes.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the Extraordinary African Chambers in July 2013 and placed in pretrial detention. In September the former leader was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-chad-leader-carried-into-court-for-war-crimes-trial.php">carried into court</a> [JURIST report] by masked security agents following his refusal to participate in his own trial. In July the Extraordinary African Chambers in Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-chad-leader-trial-suspended-upon-appointment-of-counsel.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] his trial on charges of crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes, reportedly due to the need for court appointed lawyers to prepare the former leader's defense. In March 2015 a criminal court in Chad <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/chad-court-sentences-habre-era-police-officers-for-torture.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Habré-era police officers to prison tor torture. In 2013 more than 1,000 victims filed for civil party status, asking the Extraordinary African Chambers to officially recognize them as parties with an interest in the matter. The African Union began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habré's trial after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July 2012 that Senegal must either try Habré promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/30/cote-divoire-simone-gbagbo-trial-begins">expressed confidence</a> [HRW report] on Monday that former first lady Simone Gbagbo's upcoming trial in Ivory Coast for crimes against humanity could be a "pivotal moment for justice." HRW also warned that if the trial is to be meaningful to victims, it must be credible, fair and followed by trials of other high-level rights abusers in the 2010-11 post-election crisis, regardless of their respective allegiance or political affiliation. The prosecution alleges Gbagbo participated in a &#8220;crisis committee&#8221; consisting of leaders from the political party of her husband <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] and key government ministers that planned and organized abuses against Ouattara supporters that resulted in 3,000 deaths. According to the prosecution, this was done to keep her husband in power at all costs. Gbagbo has also been indicted by the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</A> (ICC) [official website] for crimes against humanity during the post-election crisis.  HRW's West Africa Researcher Jim Wormington stated that "Simone Gbagbo's trial&#8212;the first in Ivory Coast for crimes against humanity&#8212;should be an opportunity for victims of pro-Gbagbo forces to learn the truth about her alleged role in abuses." Gbagbo has been in custody in the Ivory Coast since April 2011 and is awaiting trial which is scheduled to begin this Tuesday. The ICC trial of Laurent Gbagbo began last January in The Hague. </p>

<p>In November 2010 Laurent Gbagbo ran for reelection against former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile]. The EU recognized that Ouattara defeated Gbagbo, but Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-ivory-coast-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-war-crimes.php">refused to concede victory</a> [JURIST report]. Gbagbo has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-victims-of-ivory-coast-election-violence-must-not-be-forgotten.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of starting a civil war after losing the presidency, which resulted in 3,000 deaths and the displacement of one million people. In May 2015, a panel of appeals judges for the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icc-appeals-judges-uphold-case-against-ivory-coast-first-lady.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling against former first lady Simone Gbagbo that allows the case to go forward to trial. However, the Ivory Coast government has so far <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/former-ivory-coast-first-lady-to-be-tried-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">refused to turn Simone Gbagbo over</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC, instead insisting that their own courts can effectively dispense justice. However, some human rights groups representing the victims have refused to participate in Gbagbo's trial citing an incomplete investigation into her role in the abuses and breaches of Côte d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s criminal procedure in the preparations for the trial. At the time of announcement of her trial, Gbagbo was already sentenced to 20 years in jail for attacking state authority in the 2010-11 post-election period. Laurent Gbagbo pleaded not guilty in January to charges of crimes against humanity at the start of his trial at the ICC. He faces four charges of crimes against humanity for murder, attempted murder, rape and persecution during a wave of post-election violence between December 2010 and April 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-290_6k37.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-army-corps-of-engineers-v-hawkes-co-inc/">United States Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the Corps' determination that a property contains waters protected by the <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/cwatxt.txt">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [text] constitutes a "final agency action" reviewable under the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/05/01/act-pl79-404.pdf">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text, PDF]. Respondents are engaged in peat mining in Minnesota and applied to the Corps for a permit to mine on a particular tract of land. The Corps submitted an approved jurisdictional determination (JD) finding that the land was a wetland connected to "waters of the United States" and was therefore protected under the CWA. The district court found that this was not a "final agency action" subject to judicial review, but the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] reversed. The Supreme Court affirmed that decision in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts: "The Corps contends that the revised JD is not 'final agency action' and that, even if it were, there are adequate alternatives for challenging it in court. We disagree at both turns." Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Justice Elena Kagan filed a separate concurrence, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-felonies-agency-actions.php">heard oral augments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. <em>Certiorari</em> was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-refusing-blood-alcohol-tests.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] in December. JURIST Guest Columnists Brian Hodges and Damien Schiff of the Pacific Legal Foundation <a href="/hotline/2015/12/hodges-schiff-clean-water-act.php">discussed the case</a> [JURIST op-ed] and argued that the court should find the JD to be reviewable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/053116zor_8m59.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] Tuesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-513.htm">State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. United States ex rel. Rigsby</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15-__PetitionForWritOfCertiorari.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case concerning allegations that the insurance company defrauded the government in assessing damage following <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=hurricane+katrina&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court limited to grant to question 1: "What standard governs the decision whether to dismiss a relator's claim for violation of the [False Claims Act]'s seal requirement?" <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3730">Section 3730(b)</a> [text] of the False Claims Act (FCA) permits a private person (relator) to bring a civil action in the name of the US government for violation of the act. The complaint "shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders." There is a circuit split on the standard for determining whether to dismiss a relator's claim for violation of the seal requirement.</p>

<p>Sisters Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters who worked with State Farm after the hurricane, sued State Farm under the FCA, alleging that the company defrauded the government. A jury found that State Farm falsely claimed that damages to a home in Biloxi, Mississippi, were caused by flooding instead of wind. The court ordered State Farm to pay $758,000 in damages and awarded the Rigsbys $227,000 under the FCA. State Farm argued that the lawsuit should have been dismissed because the Rigsbys' lawyer distributed information about the lawsuit to members of the media, violating the seal requirement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org">UN Refuge Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2016/5/574d564c4/mediterranean-death-toll-soars-204000-cross-first-5-months-2016.html">reported</a> [press release] Tuesday that more than 2,500 people have died attempting to cross the Mediterranean and enter into Europe in 2016, marking an increase from the previous year. In the past week alone, it is estimated that 880 people died after their vessels either sank or capsized along the dangerous passage. According to UNHCR, around 1,855 refugees died in the crossing in the same period in 2015 and an estimated 203,981 have successfully made the journey. William Spindler, spokesperson for UNHCR <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54092#.V03cfUuQnGu">reported</a> [UN News Centre report] that "the odds of being among the dead are currently one in 81" and added that the current situation highlights the need for rescue operations and a continued push towards real and safe alternatives for people needing international protection.       </p>

<p>The rights of refugee and migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world. Last month several aid organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/migrant-deportations-to-turkey-must-stop-rights-groups-urge.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders to stop deportations of migrants from Greece to Turkey and to cease the detention of asylum seekers. Also last month <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the deportation of 66 people from the Greek island of Chios to Turkey was "riddled with an array of irregularities." HRW maintains that this deportation is significant as it gives the EU cause for concern over Turkey's respect for human rights. Also in April the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to focus on human rights in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Earlier in April UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments. In addition, last month, an independent UN human rights expert encouraged EU leaders to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-europe-to-manage-migrant-crisis.php">remain steadfast</a> [JURIST report] in their obligations to handle the recent influx of migrants to the EU and to avoid making Turkey the "gatekeeper."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A legal adviser to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] issued an <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-05/cp160054en.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion] Tuesday finding that an employer may ban an employee from wearing a headscarf for religious purposes. Written by <a href="http://www.julianekokott.de/index.php/en/">Advocate General Juliane Kokott</a> [official website], the opinion holds that "If the ban is based on a general company rule which prohibits political, philosophical and religious symbols from being worn visibly in the workplace, such a ban may be justified if it enables the employer to pursue the legitimate policy of ensuring religious and ideological neutrality." The text goes on to explain that indirect discrimination may be acceptable if it is occurs in order to "enforce a legitimate policy of religious and ideological neutrality." While Kokott's opinion is not binding on the court, the court often adopts the advocate general's opinion.</p>

<p>Face veils and other symbols of religion have been a controversial subject around the world. Last year the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of a Muslim woman <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-for-woman-denied-job-over-headscarf.php">who was denied a job</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> [corporate website] because of her headscarf. In September a Canadian court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-court-rules-women-may-wear-veil-during-citizenship-oath.php">women may be allowed to wear</a> [JURIST report] face-covering veils while swearing the oath of citizenship after an individual sued the country because she was not allowed to take part in the ceremony. Also in 2015, after suicide bombings in Fotokol by two women wearing burkas, <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/women-banned-from-wearing-burkas-in-northern-cameroon-after-suicide-bombings.php">Northern Cameroon banned</a> [JURIST report] women from wearing burkas and face-covering veils as the bombs had been smuggled into public under veils. In July 2014 the <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-france-face-covering-ban.php">European Court of Human Rights ruled</a> [JURIST report] that France's face covering ban is permissible under European law and complies with all articles of the Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and does not violate freedom of religion. In February 2013 the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/spain-supreme-court-strikes-down-city-burqa-ban.php">Spanish Supreme Court struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ban on wearing veils over the face in municipal buildings, finding that the law infringes on religious freedom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Te Cambodian parliament voted Monday to allow the Phnom Penh Municipal Court to open an investigation into opposition leader Kem Sohka regarding his alleged involvement with a prostitute. Many have called this move an attempt by the <a href="http://www.cpp.org.kh">Cambodian People's Party</a> (CPP) [party website, in Khmer], which supports political incumbent Hun Sen, to take Kem Sohka out of the 2018 election as he is the largest opposition to the CPP, <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cambodia-politics-idUKKCN0YL16C">serving as chief</a> [Reuters report] of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). Sohka has not provided information concerning the affair, he has, however, ignored court summons. The CNRP has <a href="http://www.voacambodia.com/a/as-protests-grow-cpp-votes-to-pursue-sokha/3355678.html">criticized the vote</a> [VOA report], calling it unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have caused international concern. In November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-warns-cambodias-political-polarization-reaching-breaking-point.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the increasing polarization of the political parties in Cambodia is reaching a breaking point. In October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia. Cambodia has had a history of human rights abuses that have continued to alarm rights organizations around the world. Last year Cambodia's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/cambodia-passes-controversial-new-election-laws.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] two controversial new election laws that rights groups criticized as ill-conceived and potentially damaging to free speech. In January 2015 Cambodian General Sao Sohka <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/cambodian-commander-admits-to-using-force-against-political-opposition.php">admitted to using force</a> [JURIST report] against political opponents of the reigning CPP.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A senior adviser to the <a href="http://www.ijrcenter.org/regional-communities/court-of-justice-of-the-european-union/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] submitted an advisory <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d56cf5fcf490914296afb3dcf5314f56e1.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OchyNe0?text=&docid=179042&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=603824">opinion</a> [text] Tuesday finding the July 2014 EU economic sanctions [JURIST report] against Russia legally valid. In response to a challenge by Russian oil and gas company <a href="http://www.rosneft.com">Rosneft</a> [corporate website], Melchior Wathelet found all but one sanction to be valid and asked the court to adopt his opinion. While Wathelet's opinion is non-binding, the court typically adopts the advocate general's findings. The court is expected to issue a ruling in three to six months.</p>

<p>Rosneft is not the first company to have an issue with the economic sanctions. In 2014 the Russian discount airline Dobrolet <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/eu-adopts-new-sanctions-against-russia.php">suspended all flights</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the tightening EU sanctions. The EU responded that the airline's service from Moscow to Crimea "facilitate[d] the integration of the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and undermines Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity." The economic sanctions against Russia were expected to cause more damage to the Russian economy than those imposed earlier that year, though economists and analysts expected Western economies to be impacted by them as well. The sanctions targeted the country's energy, banking and defense sectors and included a ban on the purchase or sale of new bonds, stocks or long-term debts from some Russian banks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-946_5468.pdf">refused a request</a> [order, PDF] to decide on whether the death penalty is unconstitutional. Lamondre Tucker, who murdered his pregnant girlfriend in 2008 asked the court to grant <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/tucker-v-louisiana/">Tucker v. Louisiana</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented from the denial of <em>certiorari</em>, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Breyer has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-turns-down-death-penalty-case/2016/05/31/20cf849c-2735-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54_story.html">long argued against</a> [WP report] the constitutionality of the death penalty as currently applied. Breyer noted that Tucker may have been wrongly sentenced, as the district in which he was sentenced imposes half the death sentences in Louisiana even though it only accounts for 5 percent of the state's population and homicides.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. In April Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if the state <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">prohibits lethal injection</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-rules-against-mitigating-factor-jury-instruction-in-death-penalty-cases.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-449_9o7d.pdf">Kansas v. Carr</a> [opinion, PDF] that a jury in a death penalty case does not need to be advised that mitigating factors, which can lessen the severity of a criminal act, do not need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt like aggravating factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/31133842/DOJ-Hanen-stay-motion.pdf">challenged</a> [motion, PDF] a federal judge's order requiring DOJ lawyers to attend ethics classes. <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/content/united-states-district-judge-andrew-s-hanen">Judge Andrew Hanen</a> [official website] of the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-order-doj-lawyers-to-ethics-class.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] government attorneys to take ethics classes after he accused them of misleading him in a legal challenge to President Barack Obama's amnesty orders. He accused the attorneys of being "intentionally deceptive." The judge <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/05/judge-in-immigration-case-issues-sweeping-new-order/">claimed</a> [SCOTUSBlog report] that DOJ attorneys knew that the Obama administration was approving amnesty applications but actively hid that evidence from both him and the 26 states that sued to stop the amnesty. Furthermore, he claimed that after the Obama administration had been ordered to stop, the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] had continued to approve thousands of application.The DOJ <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/31/justice-dept-objects-to-judges-order-for-ethics-cl/">argued</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report] that his order exceeds his authority and is far too costly to enforce such training.</p>

<p>The case at issue has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-immigration-action-this-term.php">taken up</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-against-immigration-initiatives.php">upheld the injunction</a> against the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/ExecutiveActions/EAFlier_DAPA.pdf">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) [materials, PDF] policy last May, a month after Hanen <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/texas-federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-blocking-presidents-immigration-action.php">declined to lift</a> [JURIST reports] the stay he imposed in February. In March of last year the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-urges-appeals-court-to-reverse-ruling-on-immigrant-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Fifth Circuit to reverse the injunction blocking the president's immigration executive action. In November 2014 Obama <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">announced two new immigration programs</a> [text], purportedly under his executive authority as president. The <a href="https://www.ice.gov/daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and the DAPA would lift the threat of deportation for about 4.7 million undocumented residents by allowing immigrants that have been in the US for more than five years or have children who are citizens to register and pass a criminal background check in order to stay in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Col. Morris Davis, former chief prosecutor for the Guantanamo military commissions, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/col-morris-davis-successfully-settles-first-amendment-lawsuit-speaking-out-about-gitmo-military">settled a freedom of speech lawsuit</a> [press release] on Tuesday against the Library of Congress after Davis was terminated from his position as assistant director of the Congressional Research Service due to his criticism of the Obama administration's decision to resume use of the military commissions system. Davis was terminated after he wrote an op-ed letter to the editor in his capacity as a civilian, which was published by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>. The case, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/davis-v-billington">Davis v. Billington</a> [case materials] was <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/davis-v-billington-complaint">filed in 2010</a> [complaint, PDF] in the District Court for the District of Columbia and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com">Goodwin Procter LLP</a> [official website] represented Davis.        </p>

<p>Davis has been a longtime critic of the national security policies of Presidents Obama and George W. Bush. In 2011 Davis wrote <a href="/forum/2011/10/morris-davis-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">an opinion piece</a> [JURIST op-ed] claiming that the CIA's killing of Anwar al-Awlaki violated the law of war. Davis drew attention to the alleged iniquities of the military commissions system in 2007, when he penned a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/opinion/26davis.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all">noted op-ed</a> [text] for the <em>New York Times</em> about his experience as chief prosecutor. Later that year Davis publicly said that he was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">pressured to use classified evidence</a> against defendants while serving as chief prosecutor at Guantanamo and that such trials were become <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/former-guantanamo-prosecutor-claims.php">overly politicized</a> [JURIST reports]. He further claimed that the push to use classified evidence stemmed from certain military officials' desire to keep the trials closed and complained that <a href="http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/Biographies/Display/tabid/225/Article/108058/brigadier-general-thomas-w-hartmann.aspx">Brig. Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile], legal adviser to the Convening Authority  for the trials, should not have been supervising his work. The issue played a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/top-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">role in his resignation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <br />
on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/44th-CA-GG-rehearing-denial-5-31-16.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF] a motion to reconsider a three-judge panel's <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-transgender-virginia-student-in-bathroom-challenge.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] in favor of a transgender Virginia student. The case, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/gg-v-gloucester-county-school-board">G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board</a> [case materials], concerns whether Title IX provides protection to individuals who identify as having a gender other than their birth gender under the clause "discrimination due to sex" and whether the clause requires a school district to allow a transgender boy to use the boy's restroom while at school. Circuit Judge Floyd said a reason the motion was denied was to help provide an "open road to the Supreme Court to seek the Court's controlling construction of Title IX for national application ... [without] the distraction of subservient issues."</p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Last month the Obama administration issued guidance to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by eleven states. Also last month, the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20043&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] Wednesday for the immediate protection of thousands of Syrian civilians. According to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website], Islamic State (IS) militants have recently seized a number of villages in northern Syria, putting individuals living near the border of Turkey at risk. There has been some effort to clear routes and allow blockaded civilians an avenue to retreat from the devastating conditions, but the situation has quickly deteriorated, and individuals living in this area continue to suffer due to the harsh conditions. These individuals struggle to obtain medical care as medical personal continue to evacuate the area. The UN experts stressed the importance of respecting civilian lives as unconfirmed reports claim that entire families and children have been subject to execution. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In March Amnesty International reported that Russian and Syrian armed forces are deliberately attacking hospitals and other medical facilities as part of a military strategy to clear the way to northern Aleppo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/about/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2015_en.htm">adopted a rule of law opinion</a> [press release] on Poland, warning that changes to the country's constitutional court pose a risk to the rule of law. Following Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) party obtaining power, a new law allowed the government to appoint judges to the highest court and not recognize those who served under the old system. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the PiS <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/01/poland-gets-official-warning-from-eu-over-constitutional-court-changes">called</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the EU's action a "made up procedure." However, Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the EC said all member states are responsible for complying with treaties passed by the Union and called for the Polish government to respond quickly:<blockquote>The rule of law is one of the foundations of the European Union. There have been constructive talks which should now be translated into concrete steps to resolve the systemic risk to the rule of law in Poland. The Opinion adopted today presents our assessment of the issues at stake, building on the dialogue which started in January. On this basis we stand ready to continue the dialogue with the Polish authorities.</blockquote>This marks the first time the EC has criticized a state under its rule of law procedure, established in 2014.</p>

<p>The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January. In February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. The PiS, a conservative party elected in October, holds an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34648575">overwhelming majority</a> [BBC report] of positions in the Polish government including the lead in both parliamentary houses and the presidency. In December the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">to a coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. However, there is a larger concern in the EU that new Polish law will erode checks and balances on government powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/151755p.pdf">reinstated</a> [opinion, PDF] a challenge to a <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/PittsburghOrdinance.pdf">Pittsburgh ordinance</a> [text, PDF] establishing a 15-foot buffer zone around abortion clinics. The <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> (ADF) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/rights-group-challenges-pittsburgh-protest-ordinance.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] the ordinance, which states that one may not "knowingly congregate, patrol, picket or demonstrate in a zone extending 15 feet from any entrance to the hospital or health care facility," including abortion clinics and other medical facilities, but the lawsuit was <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/BruniPIruling.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] last year by a judge for the <a href="http://www.pawd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website]. The Third Circuit reinstated plaintiffs' First Amendment claims Wednesday:<blockquote>Considered in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the First Amendment claims are sufficient to go forward at this stage of the litigation. The speech at issue is core political speech entitled to the maximum protection afforded by the First Amendment, and the City cannot burden it without first trying, or at least demonstrating that it has seriously considered, substantially less restrictive alternatives that would achieve the City's legitimate, substantial, and content-neutral interests.</blockquote>The appeals court made no ruling on the merits of the case, which will now return to the lower court.</p>

<p>ADF represents five anti-abortion activists, including Nikki Bruni, who engage in practices such as "sidewalk counseling" of individuals entering healthcare facilities to receive abortions. The Third Circuit has previously upheld the city's buffer zone, but plaintiffs brought a new challenge in light of a 2014 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision that <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones-violate-first-amendment.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a similar buffer zone in Massachusetts. The court held in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccullen-v-coakley/">McCullen v. Coakley</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a 35-foot protester-free buffer zone around the entrance or driveway of an abortion clinic is an unconstitutional violation of the <a href="/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text]. The <span class="casename">McCullen</span> decision was <a href="/hotline/2014/02/catherine-short-abortion-clinic-buffer-zones.php">unexpected</a> [JURIST op-ed] by some, as the court had upheld a similar restriction on free speech in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Hill_v_Colorado_530_US_703_120_S_Ct_2480_147_L_Ed_2d_597_2000_Cou">Hill v. Colorado</a> [text] in 2000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/Judgment%20part%202/3%20of%202015.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF] Mohibur Rahman to death for his part in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. His two associates, Mujibur Rahman and Abdur Razzak, were sentenced to life in prison. The three men were charged with killing two freedom fighters as well as the rape and imprisonment of civilians during the conflict, among other crimes against humanity. The men may appeal their sentences to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh within 30 days.     </p>

<p>The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with to detaining, prosecuting and punishing persons responsible for committing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under international law committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." Last month the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld the <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-high-court-upholds-islamist-leaders-death-sentence.php">death sentence issued by the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] against Islamist leader Motiur Rahman Nizami. In March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the death sentence of a former opposition politician for allegedly committing war crimes during the 1971 war of independence. In February the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-2-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two men to death for crimes against humanity. Last June a Bangladeshi court gave Syed Mohammed Hasan Ali, a fugitive commander of an auxiliary force of Pakistani troops, a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-fugitive-commander-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST report] for torture and massacre in the Liberation War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/People/House">Massachusetts House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill Wednesday that provides protection to transgender persons in public places. <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H4253">House Bill 4253</a> [text], "An Act relative to gender identity and nondiscrimination," provides that those who identify as transgender shall not be subject to discrimination in such public places as hospitals and restaurants, and will allow those who are transgender to use the rest- and locker-rooms of the gender with which they identify. A similar bill has been approved in the Massachusetts Senate, and when questioned about the topic Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said that, "No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity."</p>

<p>Transgender access to public areas has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Last month the Obama administration issued guidance to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by 11 states. Also last month the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] stated there have been 269 verified human rights violations in the Central African Republic (CAR) during his <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1613813.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] earlier this week. According to the report, circulated Wednesday, there have been more than 900 citizens affected. The report did not give a detailed account of how many of these rights violations were related to unlawful and unprovoked arrest, gender and sexual violence, or cruel treatment, but Ban did state, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/witchcraft-269-rights-violations-car-160602045659421.html">"18 incidents of human rights violations and abuse related to allegations of witchcraft affecting mainly women and children were documented"</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Among the factors increasing turmoil surrounding human rights in the CAR are torture, sexual violence, appropriation and destruction of land, and unwarranted and extended detention of citizens. The report went on to say that human rights "remain[] of grave concern, particularly as a result of continuing Boko Haram attacks in Cameroon and Chad, as well as abuses perpetrated by armed elements in the Central African Republic." This report comes at a time of relative peace, after a visit by Pope Francis earlier last year, in an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/un-says-central-african-republic-abuses-include-witchcraft/2016/06/01/c418b17a-284b-11e6-8329-6104954928d2_story.html">otherwise tumultuous</a> [AP report] portion of the world.</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2854669.stm">François Bozize</a> [BBC profile] in March 2013. More than 400,000 people remain displaced due to the violent overthrow, with over a half million more people seeking refuge in other countries. In November <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_86387.html">called for</a> [press release] aid to approximately 1.2 million <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php">children distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR. In January of last year members of a UN investigatory commission reported that crimes against humanity have been widely committed by all parties to the conflict in the CAR, prompting the commission to call for the <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-investigators-urge-creation-of-war-crimes-tribunal-for-car.php">establishment of an international court</a> [JURIST report] to objectively investigate and prosecute crimes. Earlier that month the UN published a report stating that violent acts committed in the CAR constituted <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-report-concludes-war-crimes-in-car-not-genocide.php">war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report], but not genocide. Despite this finding, members of the international community maintain that <a href="/forum/2015/02/chris-jenks-car-un-report.php">there is much work to be done</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the nation. In 2014 the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/icc-prosecutor-opens-second-investigation-into-central-african-republic-war-crimes.php">opened a second investigation</a> [JURIST report] into CAR war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) [official website] proposed a rule on Thursday seeking to address predatory loaning practices by "payday" and other high-interest lenders. The 1,000-plus-page <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/Rulemaking_Payday_Vehicle_Title_Certain_High-Cost_Installment_Loans.pdf">regulation</a> [rule, PDF] suggests two policies of note. First, the agency proposed that those lending short-term, pay-day loans conduct a "<a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/CFPB_Proposes_Rule_End_Payday_Debt_Traps.pdf">full-payment test</a>," [CFPB report] requiring lenders to "make an upfront determination of a consumer's ability to repay the loan" without having to constantly renew the loan. The agency hopes that this will put a stop to predatory loan practices which have sent millions of Americans into ever-increasing, long-term debt. Second, the rule would require lenders to give consumers notice of attempting to debit the their accounts and, most importantly, would restrict the loaners from attempting a withdrawal after two failed attempts unless later given special permission to attempt further withdrawals. Other provisions include allowing lenders to offer some longer-term, low-risk loans and requiring those loans provided under the 'full-payment test' to be reported to credit reporting agencies.</p>

<p>The CFPB was established under the Dodd-Frank Act, which was <a href="h/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php#.U0WHOq1dV94">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 in response to the 2008 financial collapse and created new regulations designed to strengthen oversight of the financial industry and protect consumers. The Act also established the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Pages/home.aspx">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> [official website] (FSOC) to identify and monitor banks that may become 'too big to fail." Additionally, the Act gives the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/index.htm">Commodities Futures Trading Commission</a> (CFTC) [official website] the ability to regulate the derivatives market, and the Federal Reserve new oversight over the largest financial institutions. JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/louise-bennetts">Louise Bennetts</a> [official profile] of the Cato Institute <a href="/hotline/2013/01/louise-bennetts-dodd-frank.php#.U0WIv61dV94">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Dodd-Frank is a poorly drafted statute with unclear principles that gives regulators too much discretion to promulgate rules.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/">German Parliament</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/18/086/1808613.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF, in German] Thursday recognizing the mass killings of ethnic Armenians by Turks during the Ottoman Empire a century ago as genocide, prompting an angry backlash and the immediate recall of the Turkish ambassador. The resolution, calling for "commemoration of the genocide of Armenian and other Christian minorities in the years 1915 and 1916," passed with support from all parties in the parliament. Turkey framed Germany's move as an attempt to come to terms with its own violent history in connection with the Jewish holocaust. Although German <a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/DE/AngelaMerkel/angela_merkel_node.html;jsessionid=2B69A81509EDF0D63D2A9EADAD522BD8.s5t2">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website] sought to calm the tensions by highlighting the friendship between the two nations, Turkish <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] stated that this development is sure to strain relations between the two countries.  Although some fear that this latest move by Germany may upset the EU's efforts to win Turkish support in stemming the flow of refugees to Europe, others predict that the vote is unlikely to prompt Turkey to make any drastic moves. One historian noted that a significant feud with Germany at this point would be "extraordinarily costly" for Turkey, given its current political instability and diplomatic isolation. </p>

<p>This vote in Bundestag comes more than a year after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/germany-parliament-calls-killings-of-armenians-genocide.php">approval of a resolution</a> in Germany's parliament declaring the killing of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces during World War I a "genocide." Germany had previously been reluctant to term the mass killings as genocide due to fear of straining trade relations between the two countries, but that changed when German <a href="http://www.bundespraesident.de/EN/Federal-President/federal-president-node.html">President Joachim Gauck</a> [official website], condemned the killings as genocide in 2015. In recent years Armenian nationals have fought with the international community to recognize the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=armenian%20genocide&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">killing of 1.5 million Armenian citizens as genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. Turkey has long disputed the numbers, alleging the killings were a result of a civil war that took place after the collapse of the Ottoman empire. In October 2015 the Grand Chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-158235#{"itemid":["001-158235"]}">ruled</a> [judgment; <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf?library=ECHR&id=003-5199806-6438950&filename=Grand%20Chamber%20judgment%20Perincek%20v.%20Switzerland%20.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] that Switzerland was wrong to prosecute former Turkish politician Doğu Perinçek for denying that the mass killings of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire in 1915 was genocide. In 2009 Turkey and Armenia <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/turkey-and-armenia-sign-accord.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a landmark accord in Switzerland to normalize relations between the two countries and open up borders. In 2010 a spokesperson for the US State Department stated that the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">opposed a vote</a> [JURIST report] before the House of Representatives on a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.252:">resolution</a> [HR 252 materials] branding the World War I-era killings of Armenians by Turkish forces as genocide. In September 2014 the Parliament of Greece ratified a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/greece-parliament-ratifies-bill-criminalizing-armenian-genocide-denial.php">criminalizes the denial of the Armenian Genocide</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://gujarathighcourt.nic.in">Gujarat High Court</a> [official website] in Ahmedabad, India, convicted 24 individuals on Thursday of murder and other charges related to the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the state of Gujarat in which hundreds of Muslims were killed. The riots, which occurred during the reign of current <a href="http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> [official website] as the Chief Minister of the state, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 individuals, most of whom were Muslims, making this India's worst outbreak of religious violence since the anti-Sikh riots in 1984. The Gujarat riots came a day after 60 Hindu pilgrims were killed in a train blaze. A court convicted 31 people years later of arson in connection with that incident. According to S.M. Vohra, a lawyer representing more than three dozen riot victims, 11 of the 24 were convicted of murder while the rest were convicted of lesser charges, which will not be made public until sentencing on Monday. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-riots-idUSKCN0YO0U2">acquitted</a> [Reuters report] 36 other defendants who had been on trial since 2009 while four of the accused died during the trial.</p>

<p>Accusations against Modi that he did not do enough to stop the rioting continue to haunt him to this day, although the prime minister has so far denied any wrongdoing. As recently as September 2014, Modi was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/india-pm-facing-human-rights-suit-in-us.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] by the American Justice Center, on behalf of unnamed survivors of violence in India, who <a href="http://www.americanjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modi_Summons__Complaint1.pdf">claimed</a> [complaint, PDF] that he failed to stop the riots. A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-india-pm-over-2002-riots.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last year, agreeing with the <a href="http://www.state.gov">US State Department</a> [official website] that Modi is entitled to immunity from lawsuits in US courts. Modi was <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/17/narendra-modi-india-election-hindu">elected</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] prime minister in May 2014 with a landslide victory. The election of the Hindu nationalist and 282 members of his conservative <a href="http://www.bjp.org">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> [official website] was called historic, as no party has won by such a margin since 1984.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In his <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=s/2016/360&referer=/english/&Lang=E">report</a> [report, PDF] issued Thursday, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] expressed shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran and South Sudan. Ban asked that those countries contributing to the 2,829 child casualties in armed conflicts during 2015 take steps to end the recruitment, killing, kidnapping, and sexual abuse of youth in armed conflicts. He also stated that those who do choose to continue these violations, "will find themselves under scrutiny by the United Nations." Most notably among those groups listed in Ban's black-list are the Saudi Arabia-led coalition and Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen, as well as SPLA, South Sudan's government forces, and the Civilian Join Task Force in Nigeria. These groups are a few of the nine governments and fifty-one armed groups that were noted recruiting and killing children in armed conflicts. A key goal of Ban's was to encourage countries responding to armed groups with children to implement mitigation tactics so as to protect children. These measures would include requiring countries to not use weapons with wide-reaching damage in areas that are highly populated.</p>

<p>Children have been at-risk groups in various conflicts worldwide. In March, the Myanmar government <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released 46 underage and child recruits from the military</a> [JURIST report] as part of a UN joint action plan made in 2012. In February UN envoy Leila Zerrougui <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-envoy-conflicts-in-2015-take-huge-toll-on-children.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that children worldwide continued to face human rights violations in 2015, particularly in Middle Eastern and African countries. Also in February, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-ukraine-hostilities-have-damaged-hundreds-of-schools.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that hostiles in eastern Ukraine had damaged or destroyed hundreds of schools, many of which were being used for military purposes. Furthermore, UN human rights experts in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram. Also earlier this month, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-express-utmost-alarm-at-worsening-situation-in-syria.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] "utmost alarm" at the worsening situation in Syria and said that parties were "constantly sinking to new depths" attacking women, children, the sick and the elderly. In August, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-report-rise-in-women-and-children-casualties-in-afghanistan.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number of women and children being hurt or killed in Afghanistan's war against the Taliban have risen by 23 and 13 percent, respectively.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/760-mohamedou-ould-slahi">Mohamedou Ould Slahi</a> [NYT materials] appeared before a secret government tribunal on Thursday, seeking to be released from his detention. Slahi, who was one of only two Guantanamo prisoners to endure a Rumsfeld approved "special interrogation plan," sat before the secretive government panel made up of representatives of various government agencies, including the Homeland Security and Justice departments, hoping to be <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/selling-author-pleads-freed-guantanamo-160602111954436.html">released to another country</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Two anonymous military officers working at Guantanamo described Slahi as "one of the most compliant detainees" and stated that he has begun to "puruse[] a new direction in life." Despite being ordered to be released by a US district judge in 2010, Slahi has <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/longtime-guantanamo-detainee-seeks-freedom-in-hearing-before-secret-panel-1464906613">remained</a> [WSJ report] at the Guantanamo facility following a government appeal in federal court. Slahi was arrested in 2001 and moved to Guantanamo in August of the following year on claims that he was a member of al Qaeda in the early 1990s and had helped recruit and assist in their terror operations, including "facilitat[ing] the travel of future 9/11 operational coordinator Ramzi Binalshibh and two future 9/11 hijackers to Chechnya via Afghanistan in 1999."</p>

<p>There are currently 80 detainees remaining at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) advocacy [website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-sues-alabama-over-abortion-restrictions-would-severely-limit-access-statewide">filed a complaint</a> [press release] in the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama challenging three recent abortion restrictions in the state. The first restriction prevents the issuance or renewal of licenses to clinics performing abortions that are located within 2,000 feet of a K-8 public school, while the second limits the types of procedures available. The first of these bills is likely to <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/politics/southunionstreet/2016/05/12/gov-bentley-signs-anti-abortion-bills-lawsuits-likely/84293432/">close down</a> [Montgomery Advertiser report] two of the state's abortion clinics. Those two clinics accounted "for 72 percent of all abortion procedures in Alabama in 2014." The third provision requires providers to give each patient a copy of her medical history. The organization claims the last requirement will "jeopardize the confidentiality of women seeking abortion services." Alabama is home to almost one-million women of reproductive age. Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama said, "[i]t's long past time for our elected officials to stop interfering with a woman&#8217;s personal decisions and to start dealing with the very real problems in our state."</p>

<p>Abortion procedures and <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights issues</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are controversial topics throughout the US. In May Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-governor-signs-two-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] dilation and evacuation abortions. In April the ACLU and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-suing-indiana-over-abortion-ban.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the state of Indiana, challenging the constitutionality of a recently signed abortion law. In March Utah became the first state to require doctors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/utah-first-state-to-require-anesthesia-for-some-abortions.php">administer anesthesia</a> [JURIST report] to women receiving an abortion after 20 weeks. Also in March West Virginia lawmakers overrode the governor's veto to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/west-virginia-south-dakota-pass-controversial-abortion-restrictions.php">enact a new law</a> [JURIST report] that prevents the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure, widely held to be the safest second-trimester abortion method. The same day, South Dakota's governor signed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protections Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.bp.com/">BP</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/press/press-releases/deepwater-horizon-mdl-2185-securities-litigation.html">stated</a> [press release] Thursday that it has agreed to pay $175 million to shareholders in a securities class action suit against the company relating back to the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Shareholders claimed the company misled them on the extent of the damages arising from the spill. The statement made clear that this settlement does "not resolve other securities-related litigation in connection with" the same incident. A separate <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-approves-20-billion-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">settlement between BP and the Department of Justice</a> [JURIST report] for $20 billion was approved earlier this year, in April. That settlement represented penalties relating to the Clean Water Act and general natural resource damage. </p>

<p>The April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill has had far-reaching and catastrophic <a href="/feature/2014/03/environmental-and-human-impact-of-bp-oil-spill.php">environmental and human impacts</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last year the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-government-to-appeal-ruling-reducing-bps-potential-oil-spill-liability.php">appealed a federal court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that reduced the potential liability BP faces under the Clean Water Act in relation to the 2010 spill. In February of last year District Court Judge Carl Barbier of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-rejects-bp-petitition-to-reduce-oil-spill-fine.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by BP to reduce the civil fine payable under the Clean Water Act. BP's appeal sought to reduce the fine per barrel from the $4,300 proposed by the US government to $3,000 per barrel. In December 2014 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/supreme-court-declines-to-review-bp-oil-spill-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to review a settlement with BP resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. In August 2014 a federal district court in Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/federal-judge-finds-bp-bears-majority-of-responsibility-for-deepwater-horizon-disaster.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that BP was grossly negligent and bears a majority of the blame for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The human rights situation in Ukraine remains troublesome following two years of conflict with Russia, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_14th_HRMMU_Report.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF] released Friday by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website]. Among the various human rights violations that have occurred, those closest to the contact line or living in areas controlled by armed forces have been subjected to "[e]nforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment," all of which "remain deeply entrenched practices." The report <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20056&LangID=E">goes on to state</a> [press release] that those most likely to commit these violations, law enforcement officers and armed security, have been granted immunity from prosecution, which is justified as an unfortunate, but necessary part of the current armed conflict. This impunity is only further exacerbated by the inability of the judicial system to address high-level officials ordering and overseeing this violence as a result of the "interference in the independence of the judiciary." UN Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic stated "[o]nly the full implementation of the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11408266/Minsk-agreement-on-Ukraine-crisis-text-in-full.html">Minsk agreement</a> [materials] will allow for the respect of everyone's human rights, and a chance to lead a normal life and even a decent living."</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In February Russia <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] on claims of financing terrorism. In August a Russian military court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">policy of refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2015 Russian liberal political activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061">Boris Nemtsov was shot in the back four times</a> [BBC report] in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guatemalan Attorney General Thelma Aldana on Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9UDDMKogJw">accused</a> [video, in Spanish] former president Otto Pérez Molina and ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti of taking nearly 130 million dollars in bribes beginning in 2011. Aldana and the <a href="http://www.cicig.org/index.php">International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website] presented <a href="http://www.cicig.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=723&cntnt01returnid=67#videos">allegations</a> [press release, in Spanish] of illicit campaign finance, illegal association, passive bribery and money laundering. CICIG said Pérez Molina and Baldetti are may have used most of the money <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-guatemala-corruption-idUKKCN0YP0BK">to fund their own lavish lifestyles</a> [Reuters report]. The accusations are the most recent in a string of bribery charges being levied against the former president. The charges also implicate other powerful politicians and business operators. Aldana ordered an estimated 50 people to be arrested in connection with the crimes. </p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9UDDMKogJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>In April Aldana accused Pérez Molina of accepting part of a $25 million bribe while in office. In December Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/guatemala-ex-president-charged-in-corruption-scandal.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] by prosecutors, suspected of illicit association, customs fraud and bribery. Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-ex-president-detained-pending-corruption-investigation.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] pending investigation in September following an indictment over corruption charges. Also in September Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-resigns-under-corruption-allegations.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/09/03/pais/la-carta-de-dimision-de-otto-perez-al-cargo-de-presidente-de-guatemala/">letter</a> [<em>El Periódico</em> materials, in Spanish] to both the Guatemalan congress and reporters announcing his resignation and his intention to "stand before justice." The day before his resignation, Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-stripped-of-immunity.php">stripped of his presidential immunity</a> [JURIST report] in a unanimous vote by congress. After Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-president-refuses-to-resign-amid-corruption-allegations.php">announced </a>[JURIST report] in August that he had no plans to resign, Guatemala's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/NC%20Redistricting.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] North Carolina's newly drawn congressional districts on Thursday. The challenge was brought after the state's General Assembly was <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-north-carolina-must-redraw-congressional-districts.php">ordered to redraw</a> [JURIST report its congressional lines by the US Supreme Court, and the challengers argued that the new congressional lines were "a blatant, unapologetic partisan gerrymander." Despite these claims, the three-judge panel decided to uphold the newly drawn lines, which have been acknowledged by at least one of the drafters to be political gerrymander, stating that "the Court's hands appear to be tied." In particular, the court stated "no judicially discernible and manageable standards for adjudicating political gerrymandering claims have emerged" and without standards they matter is nonjusticiable. While the court held that partisan considerations in a redistricting plan may go "too far," it held that the standard for determining where that is the case has not yet been revealed and has not revealed itself here.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. In April the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a redistricting decision in Arizona as not discriminatory. Earlier that same month a panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article72552187.ece/BINARY/Order%20in%20Brown's%20case.pdf">rejected a motion</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="https://corrinebrown.house.gov/">Representative Corrine Brown</a> [official profile] challenging the current congressional <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">district boundaries in Florida</a> [JURIST report]. In March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. This district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In November the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-three-judge-rule-for-redistricting-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a challenge to the Three Judge Court Act, which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. Last June the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. In April of last year the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of UN independent human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20053&LangID=E">said</a> [press release] Friday that human rights violations contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Special Rapporteurs on the right to health Dainius Pῡras, human rights defenders Michel Forst, extreme poverty,Philip Alston and violence against women Dubravka Šimonović; and the Chairperson of the UN Working Group on Discrimination against women Frances Raday urged governments to remove punitive laws and policies that block key populations' access to health services, goods and information. The statement was released prior a high-level meeting on ending AIDS by 2030. The statement went on to indicate that such laws and regulations impede highly-vulnerable groups from the health goods and services that are critical to the prevention and treatment of HIV.</p>

<p>Human rights continue to be an important issue, especially as regards to discrimination against those who have HIV. Last month California's governor signed <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_1401-1450/sb_1408_bill_20160527_chaptered.pdf">Senate Bill 1408</a> [text] into law, allowing HIV-positive individuals to become transplant donors to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/california-passes-bill-allowing-hiv-positive-donors.php">HIV-positive recipients</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015 President Barack Obama issued <a href="/documents/executiveorders/13703.php">executive order 13703</a> [JURIST documents] "Implementing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy," which was intended to ensure successful implementation of the the updated national AIDS/HIV strategy. In 2013 the <a href="http://www.corrections.com/links/link/36544">Alabama Department of Corrections</a> [official website] announced an end to its policy of segregating <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/alabama-prison-ends-hiv-positive-segregation-policy.php">HIV-positive inmates at Julia Tutwiler Prison for Women</a> [JURIST report].  In 2010 Human Rights Watch (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the <a href="http://www.doc.sc.gov/pubweb/">South Carolina Department of Corrections</a> (SCDC) [official website] to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/08/06/south-carolina-end-segregation-hiv-infected-prisoners">stop automatically segregating</a> [press release] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-group-urges-south-carolina-to-stop-segregating-hiv-positive-prisoners.php"> HIV-positive inmates</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://constitutionalcourt.gov.tr/">Turkish Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/politics/2016/06/03/turkeys-constitutional-court-rejects-opposition-chp-and-hdps-immunity-petition">rejected petitions</a> [<em>Daily Sabah</em> report] by opposition lawmakers seeking to lift immunity for members of Parliament. The Turkish parliament had passed two temporary amendments last month that would allow 138 deputies to be prosecuted on various criminal charges. One of the parties with 59 MPs facing charges is the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party (HDP), which has <a href="http://rudaw.net/english/middleeast/turkey/030620161">come out against</a> [Rudaw report] the temporary suspension of immunity as a discriminatory method by the Justice and Development (AKP) to deny Kurdish access to democracy. The bill has yet to be ratified and signed into law.</p>

<p>These claims are the recent display of political turmoil within the country. Turkish state police last month <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/turkish-police-seal-off-hotel-to-prevent-opposition-party-congress---dnp.php">prevented</a> [JURIST report] members from the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) from holding a party congress in direct opposition to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, by sealing off a hosting hotel. Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/turkish-president-refuses-to-change-anti-terrorism-law-despite-eu-deal.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in May that he does not plan to change the country's anti-terrorism law, a requirement of a deal struck between Turkey and EU in March. Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-first-round-of-deportations-from-eu-riddled-with-abuse.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in April that the first round of EU sanctioned deportations from Greece to Turkey on April 4 was "rushed, chaotic, and violated the rights of those deported." Erdoğan <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/turkey-eu-violating-international-law-by-breaking-migrant-pact.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] in April that EU states are violating international law by breaking their migrant pact with Turkey, by not allowing the country to extradite suspected terrorists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The EU must stop returning refugees to Turkey, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/06/eus-reckless-refugee-returns-to-turkey-illegal/">said</a> [press release] Friday in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/3825/2016/en/">briefing</a> [materials]. The briefing details the defects in Turkey's care of refugees, stating that the hardships faced by refugees cause such a return to be illegal under the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/3825/2016/en/">EU-Turkey Agreement of March 18</a> [text, PDF]. While open to refugees, AI claims that Turkey's resources have become drained under the weight of approximately 2.75 million Syrian refugees and 400,000 asylum-seekers and refugees from other countries who have entered the country. Issues involving such as child labor, durable solutions, and subsistence have arisen due to the number of people seeking safety. </p>

<p>In March <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">EU leaders agreed to a deal</a> [JURIST report] with Turkey to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Under the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-offers-deal-to-turkey-to-take-back-migrants/2016/03/18/809d80ba-ebab-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html">terms of the deal</a> [WP report], all migrants crossing the Aegean into Greece would be sent back to Turkey, effectively turning the country into the region's "migrant holding center." In return for receiving the migrants, the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-turkey-davutoglu-idUSKCN0WK0QQ">EU is promising</a> [Reuters report] to speed disbursement of €3 billion to Turkey, while offering an additional €3 billion by 2018 contingent upon creation of plans qualifying for EU assistance. That same month, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c8.html">Filippo Grandi</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/56dec2e99.html">expressed concerns</a> [text] for the then <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-eu-migrant-exchange-with-turkey-possibly-illegal.php">proposed migrant exchange program</a> [JURIST report] between the EU and Turkey. Grandi said in his speech before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament </a>[official website], "I am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law." AI also <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/eu-turkey-summit-eu-and-turkish-leaders-deal-death-blow-to-the-right-to-seek-asylum">demonstrated concern</a> [press release] over the deal, calling it "an alarmingly short-sighted and inhumane attitude to handling this crisis."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website]  on Friday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/30/president-obama-has-now-commuted-sentences-348-individuals">commuted</a> [press release] the sentences of 42 inmates convicted of drug offenses as part of his ongoing efforts toward <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice-reform">criminal justice reform</a> [materials]. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/03/president-obama-grants-commutations">42 inmates</a> [press release] received the commutation and a remittance of fines for some because they were believed to have earned a second chance and paid their debt to society. The men and women were convicted of various drug related charges where their sentences ranged from months to life in prison for their non-violent acts. The commutations are scheduled to go into effect beginning on October 1, 2016, throughout June 2018. The president has now commuted the sentences of 348 individuals incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. </p>

<p>Obama has recently been striving to reform the harsh sentences for non-violent drug offenders. In March Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/obama-commutes-sentences-of-61-drug-offenders.php">commuted</a> [JURIST report] the sentences of 61 federal drug offenders in an effort to reform the sentencing of non-violent criminals. Former Pardon Attorney Deborah Leff <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/former-administration-attorney-suggests-broken-system-in-resignation-letter.php">indicated</a> [JURIST report] that the pardon system is broken in her resignation letter that was obtained by <em>USA Today</em> the same month after a Freedom of Information Act request. Last July Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/obama-commutes-sentences-of-46-drug-offenders.php">commuted the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of 46 drug offenders in what he said was part of an effort by his administration to remedy the unfairness of the criminal justice system</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mandamus-petition-US-v.-Texas-6-3-16.pdf">asked</a> [petition, PDF] a federal appeals court to vacate sanctions imposedd by a district judge. The sanctions are apart of an ongoing immigration debate where 26 states <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15-40238-CV0.pdf">sued</a> [text, PDF] over the president's <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/ExecutiveActions/EAFlier_DAPA.pdf">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) [materials, PDF] immigration policy. The <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-order-doj-lawyers-to-ethics-class.php">sanctions</a> [JURIST report], which require any DOJ lawyer appearing in court in any of the 26 states undergo a mandatory ethics class. The DOJ stated in its petition:<blockquote>the district court reached far beyond its authority here and dictated the scope and content of ethical and professional responsibility training for thousands of attorneys if they appear in any federal or state court in the 26 plaintiff States. These extraordinary measures imposed by the district court transgress the constitutional separation of powers and usurp the Attorney General's statutory authority to manage the Department and set policy for ethics training and enforcement and to determine which attorneys may represent the United States in litigation throughout the nation.</blockquote>Earlier this week the DOJ formally <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/doj-objects-to-judges-order-for-ethics-classes.php">objected</a> [JURIST report] to the federal judge's order requiring DOJ lawyers to attend ethics classes.</p>

<p>The case at issue, <span class="casename">United States v. Texas</span>, has <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-immigration-action-this-term.php">been taken up</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-injunction-against-immigration-initiatives.php">upheld the injunction</a> against the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/ExecutiveActions/EAFlier_DAPA.pdf">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA) [materials, PDF] policy last May, a month after Hanen <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/texas-federal-judge-refuses-to-lift-order-blocking-presidents-immigration-action.php">declined to lift</a> [JURIST reports] the stay he imposed in February. In March of last year the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-urges-appeals-court-to-reverse-ruling-on-immigrant-action.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Fifth Circuit to reverse the injunction blocking the president's immigration executive action. In November 2014 Obama <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">announced two new immigration programs</a> [text], purportedly under his executive authority as president. The <a href="https://www.ice.gov/daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and the DAPA would lift the threat of deportation for about 4.7 million undocumented residents by allowing immigrants that have been in the US for more than five years or have children who are citizens to register and pass a criminal background check in order to stay in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Venezuelan <a href="http://www.nicolasmaduro.org.ve/biografia/#.V1M4R5MrK34">President Nicolas Maduro</a> [official profile, in Spanish] on Friday filed a complaint in the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (STJ) accusing <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] opposition leaders of partaking in international relations contrary to constitutional law. Assembly leaders previously <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN0YP257">reached</a> [Reuters report] out to the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/default.asp">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) [official website] to help resolve current political and economic issues. Maduro stated that the National Assembly usurped his exclusive presidential duties by engaging in foreign affairs. Maduro further <a href="https://panampost.com/sabrina-martin/2016/06/02/maduro-fights-back-against-oas-democratic-charter-with-lawsuit/">expressed</a> [Panam Post report] his hope that bringing the matter to court will publicize the National Assembly's treason. The lawsuit has raised national concerns that Maduro may intend to eventually dissolve the National Assembly's opposition majority. </p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government STJ and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December election. In April the STJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-top-court-rejects-attempt-to-cut-presidents-term.php">rejected an attempt</a> [JURIST report] by the National Assembly to shorten Maduro's term from six years to four. The assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">approved new new referendum rules</a> [JURIST report] to speed up the process of requesting recall referendums. In March the STJ ruled that the National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review the appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party. The 13 justices were sworn in on December 23, immediately prior to the exit of prior Socialist Party majority. In February the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">upheld Maduro's economic emergency decree</a> [JURIST report] as legal and valid despite a rejection by the national assembly. The decree allowed the president to control the budget, companies and the currency. In January the STJ ruled that all <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">decisions from the opposition-led assembly would be void</a> [JURIST report] until three opposition lawmakers were removed from their seats. The court's decision came days after the assembly swore in elected lawmakers that were <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">temporarily barred by the court</a> [JURIST reports]. The ruling had suspended four elected lawmakers for their involvement in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/venezuela-socialist-party-challenges-recent-election-of-opposition-politicians.php">alleged election fraud last December</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Saturday began the trial of a journalist union leader as well as two board members who were charged with spreading false news and harboring wanted reporters. About a month prior, Union leader Yahya Qalash <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/egypt-begins-trial-head-journalists-union-members-39606528">denounced</a> [AP report] authorities for the arrest of two protesting journalists who sought refuge in the union's headquarters. Though Qalash initially called for the interior minister's resignation and a presidential apology, he withdrew his comments later to defuse tensions. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] has publicly opposed the trial, accusing the government of cracking down on the freedom of expression and creating a "state of fear." The defendants have requested postponement and will continue the hearing later this month.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC profile] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Last month more than 100 Egyptian demonstrators were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egyptian-courts-sentence-protesters-to-five-years-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] for peacefully assembling without a permit. Three UN rights experts recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-egypt-must-end-crackdown-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. In early May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts urged Egypt to cease its <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">cease</a> [JURIST report] its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Chinese official said Saturday that China will ignore a decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the South China Sea dispute. The Philippines filed a <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/web/view/7">case</a> [materials] against the People's Republic of China with the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">UN Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] in 2013 disputing the latter's territorial claims in the South China Sea (SCS). China's territorial claims in the SCS overlap with territory claimed by other Asian countries. At the <a href="http://www.iiss.org/en/events/shangri-s-la-s-dialogue">Shangri-La Dialogue</a> [official website], Chinese military officials <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/04/india-japan-say-south-china-sea-peace-will-bring-prosperity.html">maintained</a> [AP report] that the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction. The US has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-security-idUSKCN0YQ01N">vowed</a> [Reuters report] to take action with other nations if China does not stop constructing on territory claimed by others in the SCS.</p>

<p>China claims nearly the entire 3.5 million square-kilometer SCS, a region rich in oil and minerals, to the detriment of political stability in Asia and the world. In January the Supreme Court of the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/philippines-high-court-approves-deal-to-extend-us-military-presence.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a deal that would extend US military presence in their country. In October the PCA <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hague-court-to-rule-in-south-china-sea-dispute.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that it has jurisdiction to hear the dispute between the Philippines and China. In July Chinese ambassador Zhao Jianhua <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/china-boycotts-arbitration-of-teritory-dispute-with-philippines.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the country would not participate in PCA hearings over the dispute between China and the Philippines.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three Taliban gunmen on Sunday attacked a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor. Authorities <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/05/gunmen-kill-afghan-prosecutor-4-others-in-courthouse-attack.html">state</a> [AP report] that 21 others were injured in the attack before the gunmen were shot dead by policemen. The attack follows an incident last week when four disguised Taliban gunmen attacked another court building in the eastern Ghazni province. Recent attacks have been perceived as a war against judicial officials incited by the execution of six convicted insurgents last month. In light of these attacks, the <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] has stressed the importance of securing judicial institutions and protecting judicial officials and civilians. </p>

<p>Civilian casualties continue to be a primary issue in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. In February UNAMA <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high 11,000 in 2015. In November the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] and Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/pentagon-determines-human-error-caused-afghanistan-hospital-bombing.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing of the <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (MSF) [advocacy website] hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/631359/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-campbell-via-teleconference-fro">announced</a> [statement] that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error." In October MSF called for an <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/doctors-without-borders-seeks-investigation-into-us-bombing-of-afghan-hospital.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the attack by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission. Also in October the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-kunduz-clinic-airstrikes.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Kunduz hospital attack and for the results of an investigation to be made public. Several days prior to the hospital attack, the UN rights leader also requested that all parties in the Taliban attack in Kunduz <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-afghanistan-attack-to-protect-civilians.php">attempt to keep civilians out of harm</a> [JURIST report]. In August the UN said that a new report shows a significant increase in the number of <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-report-rise-in-women-and-children-casualties-in-afghanistan.php">women and children being hurt or killed</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan's war against the Taliban and other insurgents. In June the UN Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, Mark Bowden, stated that the hostilities in Afghanistan are leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-afghanistan-conflict-has-killed-thousands.php">killing and wounding of thousands</a> [JURIST report] and the forced relocation of families into neighboring countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Associated Press (AP) investigation has <a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/Hate-crimes-not-reported-13391163">found</a> [AP report] that thousands of police agencies across the country do not submit hate crime reports to the FBI. Although many agencies and departments would only file zeros, federal guidelines <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2016/06/05/most-indiana-agencies-dont-report-hate-crimes-fbi/85290262/">call</a> [<em>Indianapolis Star</em> report] for reports to be submitted. Underreporting may mask the extent of bias crimes nationwide and may also show the low-priority some agencies and departments place on hate crimes. Also, victims are limited to relying on the FBI to investigate and bring charges in states that do not have a hate crime statute. Hate crime reports <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2016/06/05/small-arizona-agencies-lax-on-hate-crime-reporting/85449190/">aid</a> [AP report] the Department of Justice (DOJ), journalists and researchers in tracking hate crime patterns nationwide. The AP report showed that 17 percent of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide have not submitted hate crime reports for the past six years.</p>

<p>The AP report comes at a time where the relationship between police and race has been questioned on a national scale. Last month Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law an amended hate crime bill that adds police, EMS workers and firefighters to protected categories. Also last month a Baltimore judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/baltimore-police-officer-acquitted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] police officer Edward Nero on all counts for his role in the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who was injured in police custody and later died. In February the DOJ began its <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">review</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco police department. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] not to indict two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Cairo appeals court on Saturday acquitted 33 protesters previously sentenced to two years in prison. The protesters were among 300 others who were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-appeals-court-acquits-33-convicted-for-april-protests/2016/06/05/7574232c-2b09-11e6-b9d5-3c3063f8332c_story.html">arrested</a> [AP report] in April for holding a large scale public demonstration against the surrendering of the Red Sea Island to Saudi Arabia. While the government cracked down on the demonstration, one of the largest since President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi was elected, the majority of the protesters have been freed, acquitted or released on bail. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC profile] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. This week an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-court-begins-trial-for-journalist-union-leader-and-members.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of a journalist union leader as well as two board members who were charged with spreading false news and harboring wanted reporters. Last month more than 100 Egyptian demonstrators were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egyptian-courts-sentence-protesters-to-five-years-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] for peacefully assembling without a permit. Three UN rights experts recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-egypt-must-end-crackdown-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. In early May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">urged Egypt to cease  </a>[JURIST report] its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060616zor_o7kq.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] Monday in two death penalty cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-797.htm">Moore v. Texas</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Moore-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide (1) whether it violates the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] and the Supreme Court's decisions in <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-finds-florida-iq-cutoff-for-executions-unconstitutional.php">Hall v. Florida</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/536/304.html">Atkins v. Virginia</a> [opinion] to prohibit the use of current medical standards on intellectual disability, and require the use of outdated medical standards, in determining whether an individual may be executed; and (2) whether execution of a condemned individual more than three-and-a-half decades after the imposition of a death sentence violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-8049.htm">Buck v. Stephens</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Filed-Buck-Cert.-Pet._3-2.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] concerns racial bias and discrimination. The question before the court is whether the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit imposed an improper and unduly burdensome Certificate of Appealability (COA) standard when it denied Buck a COA on his motion to reopen the judgment and obtain merits review of his claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for knowingly presenting an "expert" who testified that Buck was more likely to be dangerous in the future because he is black, where future dangerousness was both a prerequisite for a death sentence and the central issue at sentencing.</p>

<p>Also Monday the court agreed to take on a case regarding racial gerrymandering. The court noted jurisdiction in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-680.htm">Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/15-___JurisdictionalStatement.pdf">jurisdictional statement</a>, PDF]. The questions before the court are:<br />
<blockquote><ol><br />
	<li>Did the court below err in holding that race cannot predominate even where it is the most important consideration in drawing a given district unless the use of race results in "actual conflict" with traditional districting criteria? </li><br />
	<li>Did the court below err by concluding that the admitted use of a one-size-fits-all 55% black voting age population floor to draw twelve separate House of Delegates districts does not amount to racial predominance and trigger strict scrutiny? </li><br />
	<li>Did the court below err in disregarding the admitted use of race in drawing district lines in favor of examining circumstantial evidence regarding the  contours of the districts?  </li><br />
	<li>Did the court below err in holding that racial goals must negate all other districting criteria in order for race to predominate? </li><br />
	<li>Did the court below err in concluding that the  General Assembly's predominant use of race in drawing House District 75 was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest?</li><br />
</ol></blockquote></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-339_1b7d.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ross-v-blake/">Ross v. Blake</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that an inmate could not file a court challenge against a prison guard without exhausting all administrative remedies. The question before the court was whether there is a "special circumstances" exception under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1997e">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a> (PLRA) [text], which requires inmates to exhaust all administrative remedies, when the inmate erroneously believed that he satisfied this requirement by participating in an internal investigation. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court held that there is no such exception:<blockquote>The [PLRA] mandates that an inmate exhaust "such administrative remedies as are available" before  bringing suit to challenge prison conditions. The court below adopted an unwritten "special circumstances" exception to that provision, permitting some prisoners to pursue litigation even when they have failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. Today, we reject that freewheeling approach to exhaustion as inconsistent with the PLRA.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Justice Stephen Breyer filed an opinion concurring in part.</p>

<p>The case arose after prison inmate Shaidon Blake sued Lieutenants Michael Ross and James Madigan for excessive use of force. The officers filed an amended answer to the complaint alleging that Blake had not exhausted all administrative remedies available as the PLRA required. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13-7279-2015-05-21.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the lower court decision and held that the "special circumstances" exception to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement was met. The court stated that the internal investigation provided prison official ample time to address Blake's complaints and Blake believed he had exhausted all administrative remedies, thus meeting the "special circumstances" exception. The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-debt-collection-prisoner-exhaustion.php">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in March after <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-refusing-blood-alcohol-tests.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-109_p860.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/simmons-v-himmelreich/">Simmons v. Himmelreich</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that an inmate's lawsuit against a prison guard may proceed. The court held that the dismissal of the inmate's claim under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-171">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FTCA) [text] does not preclude a parallel <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bivens_actions">Bivens</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] claim. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court:<blockquote>The [FTCA] allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the United States for certain torts committed by federal employees. ... Many of the FTCA's procedural provisions are contained in a single chapter of the United States Code, Chapter  171. ... But an "Exceptions" section of the FTCA dictates that "the provisions of [Chapter 171] ... shall not apply" to certain categories of claims. At issue in this case is whether one of the "provisions of [Chapter   171]"&#8212;the so-called judgment bar provision, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2676">§2676</a> [text]&#8212;might nonetheless apply to one of the excepted claims. We conclude it does not.</blockquote>The ruling affirms a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/15-109-op-below.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</p>

<p>Inmate Walter Himmelreich filed two suits alleging that he was beaten by a fellow inmate as a result of the guards' negligence. His first suit was dismissed as an "Exception" to the FTCA, and the court also dismissed his second suit, holding that it was precluded by the judgment bar provision. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-case.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in this case in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a plan that would provide all citizens with a guaranteed basic income. The proposal called for all adults to be paid an unconditional monthly income, regardless of need. Many of those who supported the proposal <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36443512">suggested</a> [BBC report] a monthly income of 2500 Swiss francs for every adult and 625 francs for every child. However, the results of the vote on Sunday <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060">showed</a> [BBC report] that almost 77 percent of the population opposed the plan. Beyond the lack of support by the public, very few politicians have supported the idea. The majority of those opposing the plan were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/06/world/europe/switzerland-swiss-vote-basic-income.html?_r=0">concerned</a> [NYT report] at the cost to society as a whole to fund such a project as well as the message it would send to compensate those who did not work. Other regions such as Finland and the Dutch city of Utretch are also considering similar measures.</p>

<p>Income for all and <a href="/feature/2015/11/minimum-wage-feature-section-iv.php">income equality movements</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have increased over recent years. In 2014 Swiss citizens <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-27459178">also rejected</a> [BBC report] a measure to give Switzerland the world's highest minimum wage. That measure would have raised the Swiss minimum wage to 22 francs an hour. However, like the most recent referendum, that measure was rejected by over three-fourths of the population. Other political measures such as a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/swiss-voters-reject-deportation-measure.php">deportation referendum</a> [JURIST report] were also rejected by the Swiss citizens earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google argued that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-wont-hear-out-google-in-advertising-lawsuit-1465224757">such a ruling was incorrect</a> [WSJ report] as the damages must be calculated individually for each advertiser rather than all together. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] decided that such a measure is unnecessary and damages would be awarded based on the average advertiser's experience.</p>

<p>Google is involved in numerous legal disputes. In May a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-jury-rules-for-google-in-copyright-battle-against-oracle.php">US jury concluded</a> [JURIST report] that Google was not in violation of copyright laws where it used Oracle's Java programming language to develop its operating system, Android. The Supreme Court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-google-books-appeal.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in an appeal from Google against a finding for authors claiming that Google Books violated copyright law by scanning millions of books and placing them within an online search engine. The Fifth Circuit also <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-google-may-not-ignore-mississippi-subpoena.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in April that Google may not ignore a subpoena by the Mississippi Attorney General. In March, a Moscow arbitration court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/russia-arbitration-court-upholds-ruling-against-google.php">upheld a ruling against Google</a> [JURIST report] that they broke anti-monopoly laws by abusing their position within the cellular application industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20065&LangID=E">urged</a> [text] the Iraqi government to "take immediate measures to ensure that" those fleeing the city of Fallujah are "treated in strict accordance with international human rights and international humanitarian laws." Zeid cited "credible reports" that fleeing migrants have suffered physical abuse at the hands of "armed groups operating in support of the Iraqi security forces." These groups have reportedly been separating migrants by gender, detaining men for "security checks," which largely amount to physical abuse for the sake of forced confessions. Zeid ended his remarks stating that while the Iraqi government has a legitimate interests in making vetting migrants to ensure that they do not impose security risks, such vetting should take place through the appropriate laws and in a "transparent manner."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/2014/11/introduction-isis.php">Islamic State</a> (IS) [JURIST backgrounder], which controls Fallujah, has caused increasing international alarm over its <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/hrw-islamic-state-conducted-mass-executions-of-shiite-prisoners.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] since its insurgence into Syria and Iraq in 2013.

In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in The Hague and <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the court to open a genocide investigation in Northern Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d5ac769045338143a7a57fc70b74671fef.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuTahn0?text=&docid=179662&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=535433">ruled</a> [judgment; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-06/cp160058en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] Tuesday that non-EU immigrants who illegally enter the Schengen area across an internal border should not be jailed solely on that basis. They can, however, be returned first through a time allowing for voluntary return and then through "forced removal measures." The forced removal measures are to be conducted in the "least coercive" manner possible, and these procedures must be utilized before imprisonment. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issue around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. In March the Court of Justice ruled that Germany may place <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">"residence conditions"</a> [JURIST report] on refugees. In February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are too restrictive and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">place undue hardships</a> [JURIST report] on refugees and asylum-seekers. Also in February Amnesty International warned Austria that they are violating human rights through their daily <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-austria-cap-on-asylum-seekers-violates-human-rights.php">cap on asylum applications</a> [JURIST report]. In January Danish lawmakers approved a controversial bill that will allow Danish authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/denmark-lawmakers-approve-seizure-of-asylum-seekers-assets.php">seize assets</a> [JURIST report] from immigrants seeking asylum in order to cover their expenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060616zor1_2135.pdf">declined to hear</a> [order list, PDF] a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ecuador-Chevron-SCT-Petition-for-Certiorari-and-Appendix-FINAL.pdf">challenge</a> [cert. petition, PDF] by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19331501">Ecuador</a> [BBC profile] over an <a href="https://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/TribunalInterimMeasuresOrder.pdf">arbitration award</a> [arbitration order, PDF] to <a href="https://www.chevron.com/">Chevron Corp</a> [official website]. In 2011 Chevron was issued a $96 million international arbitration award over a dispute involving development of oil fields in Ecuador. The award was issued by the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] in The Hague. The Supreme Court let stand the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/chevron-op-below.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website], which found in favor of Chevron. The dispute is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-chevron-idUSKCN0YS1G6">result</a> [Reuters report] of a 1973 deal by Texaco Petroleum, whom Chevron later acquired, where Texaco agreed to develop oil fields in exchange for selling oil to Ecuador's government at below-market price. Chevron initiation arbitration proceedings at The Hague in 2006 claiming Ecuador's court failed to resolve the lawsuit in a timely manner.</p>

<p>This is one of several legal battles waged in the last few years regarding Chevron's practices in Ecuador. In September the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-top-court-rules-for-ecuador-villagers-in-suit-against-chevron.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of Ecuadorian villagers seeking to enforce a multi-billion dollar judgment against Chevron. In March of last year Judge Lewis Kaplan of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-blocks-us-courts-from-enforcing-chevron-judgment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that US courts could not be used to enforce the Ecuadorian ruling against Chevron. In ruling Kaplan stated that the Ecuadorian proceedings were fraught with corruption and the punishment did not "justify the means." Later that month Chevron <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/chevron-seeking-32-million-in-legal-fees-in-ecuador-case.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the Southern District of New York against attorney Steven Donziger for $32 million in fees relating to a suit it won against his firm for fraud and racketeering throughout the course of the 2011 Ecuadorian litigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://about.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> [corporate websites] and various rights groups expressed <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/ectr_coalition_letter_6-6.pdf">opposition</a> [letter, PDF] Monday to legislation that extends categories of Internet records that the government can collect without court approval through the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/national-security-letters">National Security Letters</a> [ACLU backgrounder]. These expanded powers would allow the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] to get a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3079957/security/google-facebook-yahoo-rights-groups-oppose-fbi-expansion-of-surveillance-powers.html">variety of new information</a> [PCWorld report] such as IP addresses, routing and transmission information, session data, browsing history, e-mail metadata, location information, and log in times and dates. The first piece of legislation opposed is the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s1705/BILLS-114s1705pcs.pdf">Intelligence Authorization Act</a> [bill, PDF]. This bill is supposed to expand warrant less government surveillance. The bill would allow any FBI field office to demand e-mail records without a court order. The other piece of legislation is a <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.356%20Cornyn1%20-%20OLL16601.pdf">proposed amendment</a> [amendment, PDF] to the <a href="https://it.ojp.gov/privacyliberty/authorities/statutes/1285">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> [DOJ report], which would extend the list of available information the government can seek to include information such as account numbers, login history and bank account information.</p>

<p>Technology continues to raise important privacy questions. In April Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/microsoft-sues-doj-over-customer-email-privacy.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the Department of Justice regarding the privacy of their customers' e-mails. Also that month the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-no-warrant-required-to-obtain-phone-location-records.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that obtaining phone location records without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Last November the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-declines-case-on-cell-data-search-warrant.php">rejected a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data. In October California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-governor-signs-sweeping-digital-privacy-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the California Electronic Communications Act (CECA), a law that many are touting as a substantial step forward for digital privacy and protecting users' rights. The law, which was approved alongside more than 10 other bills, bars any state's law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from requesting sensitive metadata from persons or businesses without a warrant. Also in October the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies is not sufficiently protected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&LangID=E">Crimes against humanity</a> [press release], including enslavement, imprisonment, torture, rape and murder have been widespread in Eritrea, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIEritrea/Pages/commissioninquiryonhrinEritrea.aspx">UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea</a> [official website] said in a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoIEritrea/A_HRC_32_CRP.1_read-only.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday. The commission has been collecting testimony of these harsh conditions since 2014. According to the report, these conditions have yet to improve. Mike Smith, chair of the commission, said:<blockquote>Eritrea is an authoritarian State. There is no independent judiciary, no national assembly and there are no other democratic institutions in Eritrea. This has created a governance and rule of law vacuum, resulting in a climate of impunity for crimes against humanity to be perpetrated over a quarter of a century.</blockquote>The commission suggested that these crimes against humanity should be dealt with by the International Criminal Court, alleging that state officials, the ruling party and commanding officers bear the responsibility of these conditions.</p>

<p>Eritrea has faced much criticism from the international community for continued abuses of human rights. In 2013 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-urges-eritrea-to-stop-human-rights-violations.php">called</a> for an end to human rights abuses in Eritrea and appealed to the international community to increase <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-increased-scrutiny-in-eritrea.php">scrutiny</a> [JURIST reports] of the nation. The UN also pleaded for <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-international-community-to-aid-eritrea-refugees.php">aid</a> [JURIST report] for Eritrean refugees, as denial of asylum would most likely condemn them to death, based on the country's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.53_ENG.pdf">shoot to kill order</a> [report, PDF] for anyone attempting to leave the country illegally. In late 2013 a report from Dutch and Swedish researchers discovered that officers of the Eritrean military were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/report-finds-eritreas-military-involved-in-human-trafficking-to-sudan.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] and smuggling them into Sudan. In March 2015 another UN commission released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-commission-reports-human-rights-violations-in-eritrea.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that found that the various human rights abuses found in Eritrea included torture, a large number of detentions, and paltry wages insufficient for an adequate standard of living.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] operative Sabrina de Sousa will be extradited to Italy to serve a four-year prison sentence following a ruling by <a href="http://www.tribunalconstitucional.pt/tc/home.html">Portugal's Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday. De Sousa <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/cia-agent-appeals-italy-extradition-order-to-portugal-constitutional-court.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in April, a last attempt to prevent her extradition to Italy to serve a sentence for her involvement in a US extraordinary renditions program. De Sousa was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/portugal-court-orders-cia-agent-extradited-to-italy-in-rendition-case.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in a Portuguese airport after she had been convicted <em>in absentia</em> by an Italian court for her part in the 2003 kidnapping and rendition of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. The <a href="http://www.stj.pt">Portugal Supreme Court</a> [official website] rejected her appeal of an extradition order, leaving De Sousa no choice but to argue that her extradition order is unconstitutional. De Sousa was one of 26 Americans convicted in the kidnapping. </p>

<p>Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. In September 2009 the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-dismissal-of-diplomatic.php">motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by De Sousa seeking diplomatic immunity against the Italian charges. De Sousa was one of many operatives whose sentences were <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">increased</a> [JURIST report] from five to seven years in 2010 by an Italian intermediate appellate court and upheld by the Italian Court of Cassation in 2012. In February the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/european-court-of-human-rights-condemns-italy-for-role-in-rendition-case.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Italy for its role in the rendition program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-108_k4mp.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-2 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/puerto-rico-v-sanchez-valle/">Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/double_jeopardy">double jeopardy clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] bars Puerto Rico and the US from successively prosecuting a single person for the same conduct under equivalent criminal laws. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court held that, for the purposes of double jeopardy, Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign:<blockquote>To determine whether two prosecuting authorities are different sover­eigns for double jeopardy purposes, this Court asks a narrow, historically focused question. The inquiry does not turn, as the term "sovereignty" sometimes suggests, on the degree to which the second entity is autonomous from the first or sets its own political course. Rather, the issue is only whether the prosecutorial powers of the two juris­dictions have independent origins&#8212;or, said conversely, whether those powers derive from the same "ultimate source." ... In this case, we must decide if, under that test, Puerto Rico and the United States may successively prosecute a single defendant for the same criminal conduct. We hold they may not, because the oldest roots of Puerto Rico's power to prosecute lie in federal soil.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas also filed a separate concurrence. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.</p>

<p>Two men, Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vasquez, were charged with violating a local Puerto Rican law criminalizing the sale of firearms without a license. Prior to trial, both men were independently charged under similar federal laws. Both men were found guilty on the federal charges and sought dismissal of the local charges, arguing double jeopardy. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-iran-terrorism-compensation-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pennsylvania</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that Pennsylvania's Chief Justice should have recused himself from a death penalty case in which he formerly served as prosecutor. Terrance Williams was convicted of first degree murder in Philadelphia and sentenced to death. Ronald Castillo was the district attorney in Philadelphia during the trial and was subsequently elected to serve on the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Williams then appealed his death sentence to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, arguing misconduct on the part of the Philadelphia prosecutor's office when Castillo was serving as the district attorney. Castillo did not recuse himself from the case on appeal, claiming that he was not improperly biased. The Pennsylvania court unanimously denied Williams' appeal, then denied his motion for reconsideration after Castillo retired from the bench. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court vacated the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's judgment:<blockquote>Where a judge has had an earlier significant, personal involvement as a prosecutor in a critical decision in the defendant's case, the risk of actual bias in the judicial proceeding rises to an unconstitutional level. Due process entitles Terrance Williams to "a proceeding in which he may present his case with assurance" that no member of  the court is "predisposed to find against him."</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Clarence Thomas also filed a dissenting opinion.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in February. <em>Certiorari</em> was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-adds-13-cases-to-2015-docket.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) [official website] <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/latest_news/crown_prosecution_service_statement_operation_lydd/">stated</a> [press release] on Thursday that there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone in MI6 for its involvement in the movement and alleged ill treatment of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14786753">Abdel Hakim Belhadj</a> [BBC profile], and <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/case-study/al-saadi-family/">Sami Al Saadi</a> [Reprieve profile] and their respective families in South East Asia to Libya in 2004.  More specifically, the head of the CPS's <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/your_cps/our_organisation/sc_and_ctd.html">Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division</a> (SCCTD) [official website] Sue Hemming stated that the CPS thoroughly investigated the case and analyzed evidence from the Metropolitan Police relating to one suspect and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge the suspect with any criminal offense.  According to CPS, evidence was obtained and information was gathered from a large number of records, individuals and organizations including the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service, governmental bodies of other countries, alleged victims and other witnesses during the course of the four year investigation.  CPS stated that it considered a bringing number of charges, including kidnapping, false imprisonment, torture, and misconduct in public office, and that it had to decide whether it had the jurisdictional authority to prosecute each offense, as the movement and alleged ill-treatment took place outside the UK.  According to CPS, "It is clear ... that officials from the UK did not physically detain, transfer or ill-treat the alleged victims directly, nor did the suspect have any connection to the initial physical detention of either man or their families."  Belhadj expressed his disappointment with this <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-libya-rendition-idUKKCN0YV1RQ">announcement</a> [Reuters report], while parliament's <a href="http://isc.independent.gov.uk/">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> [official website] has stated its intention to examine the case as part of its "ongoing inquiry into the role of the UK government and its security agencies" in the treatment and rendition of detainees.</p>

<p>UK officials have struggled with allegations of <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/uk-supreme-court-hears-libya-rendition-claim.php">mistreatment of prisoners</a> [JURIST report] in recent years. In January 2012 the chairman of the <a href="http://www.detaineeinquiry.org.uk/">UK Detainee Inquiry</a> [official website], a panel created to investigate illegal renditions and other allegations of misconduct, announced that his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/uk-panel-will-not-complete-investigation-into-torture-allegations.php">panel would not complete their investigation</a> [JURIST report]. Later that year UK Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-pm-announces-investigation-into-alleged-renditions-to-libya.php">investigation into collusion</a> [JURIST report] between MI6, the overseas British Security Service and the Libyan Security Services regarding the treatment of former Guantanamo Bay detainees. Accusations of MI6 sending detainees to knowingly be tortured by Libyan security services prompted Cameron to instruct the Detainee Inquiry to examine the issue. The Detainee Inquiry was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">established</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010 to investigate claims that British government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-458_b07d.pdf">ruled</A> [opinion; PDF] 6-2 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dietz-v-bouldin/">Dietz v. Bouldin</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that federal district courts have "the inherent power to rescind a jury discharge order and recall a jury for further deliberations" in a civil trial to remedy an error in the jury's verdict. Writing for the Court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor added that "this power is limited in duration and scope, and must be exercised carefully ... [b]ecause the potential of taint­ing jurors and the jury process after discharge is extraor­dinarily high."  The question of whether a federal district court can recall a jury after it had discharged came up in when the jury, while ruling in favor of the plaintiff, returned a "legally impermissible verdict" by awarding damages of $0 to Dietz, which was well below the stipulated amount of $10,136. The judge, realizing the error after discharging the jury, re-empaneled it and ordered them to deliberate again to reach a new verdict. The defendant's attorney objected to the re-empanelling of the discharged jurors, stating that they were no longer capable of reaching a fair and impartial verdict. However, the judge, after confirming that no member of the jury spoke to anyone about the case during the short time that they were discharged, set aside the objection and ordered the jury to start over, stating that he would "hate to just throw away the money and time that's been expended in this trial." The jury then returned with a verdict of $15,000 in damages in favor of Dietz. The case finally came to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dietz-op-below.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, holding that the district court exercised its inherent powers to rescind its discharge order and recall a jury cautiously in this instance and therefore stayed within the bounds of the harmless error standard of Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, stating that the common law rule that judges may not call back a discharged jury to amend a verdict is even more relevant in "today's world of cellphones, wireless Internet, and 24/7 news coverage."  He added that "Jurors may easily come across prejudicial information when, after trial, the court lifts their restrictions on outside information." Justice Anthony Kennedy joined the dissent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski filed a <a href="http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/09132201/Tennessee-Counseling-Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the Chancery Court for Anderson County on Tuesday, challenging a Tennessee <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/109/Amend/HA1006.pdf">law</a> [SB 1556, PDF] that protects counselors who refuse to provide services to individuals based on their religious beliefs. Tennessee <a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Governor Bill Haslam</a> [official website], who is named in the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.tn.gov/governor/news/39923">signed the bill</a> [press release] into law in April. The bill shields counselors and therapists that refuse to treat clients who conflict with the "sincerely held principles" of the counselor. The men claim the law violates both state and federal grants of equal protection. The law mandates that a professional refusing to serve a client on these grounds must refer the client to another professional who will provide the service. Copas and Laieski maintain that the LGBT community was the<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennessee-lgbt-idUSKCN0YU2IL">sole target</a> [Reuters report] of the legislation. </p>

<p>The intersection of religious liberty, sexual orientation and gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US. In April Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/louisiana-govenor-signs-order-banning-LGBT-discrimination.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] an executive order creating a new anti-discrimination law intended to protect members of the LGBT community. Prior to signing the executive order, there was no state law in Louisiana protecting LGBT individuals from employment discrimination. Shortly before Georgia Governor Nathan Deal said that he would <a href="paperchase/2016/03/georgia-governor-to-veto-controversial-religious-liberty-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] a religious freedom bill that critics claim would sanction discrimination against LGBT individuals. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe also <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=14787">vetoed</a> [press release] a similar bill in March. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] during a press conference that he would not defend House Bill 2, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. That legislation <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">specifically prohibits</a> [JURIST report] local municipalities from enacting anti-discrimination ordinances.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Independent experts for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20077&LangID=E">determined</a> [press release] Thursday that an Irish woman was "subjected to discrimination and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment," when seeking an abortion. The woman, going by "AM," discovered her fetus suffered from fatal congenital defects in 2011 and, as a result, AM would miscarry. She was 21 weeks pregnant at the time. Under Irish law, AM was faced with the option of either carrying her dying fetus to term or seeking abortion services outside of the country. The UN made note that while AM sought medical treatment in the UK at her own expense, she was separated from any family or support and had to return to Ireland within hours of the procedure due to financial circumstances. Upon returning to Ireland the woman was <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54180#.V1ozTrsrKM-">denied medical treatment</a> [UN News Centre report] usually offered to women who suffer miscarriages. Under the law, AM was encumbered by restrictions on disseminating information on abortions placed on health care providers. Such providers face sanctions if they cannot distinguish between informing or "supporting," and "promoting" abortion procedures. The UN called on the nation to balance the rights of the fetus with the rights of the woman. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Abortion access and reproductive healthcare</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain contentious issues worldwide. In April Polish citizens protested a possible <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/poland-citizens-protest-proposed-abortion-ban.php">total abortion ban</a> [JURIST report] following the suggestion of the ruling legislative party's president. The ruling conservative Law and Justice party wanted to bring the country's abortion policies in line with the Catholic Church's views on the practice. The High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland in November <a href="https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2015/%5B2015%5D%20NIQB%2096/j_j_HOR9740Final.htm">ruled</a> [judgment] that Northern Ireland's abortion laws, which only allow abortion when the mother faces the risk of death or serious injury, are a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/northern-ireland-court-restrictive-abortion-laws-violate-human-rights.php">violation of human rights</a> [JURIST report]. According to an Amnesty International report released the same month, El Salvador's complete ban on abortion <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-el-salvador-abortion-law-breeding-atmosphere-of-fear.php">negatively affects</a> [JURIST report] not only women and girls, but also their families. A Dominican court in December <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/dominican-republic-high-court-restores-total-abortion-ban.php">blocked </a>[JURIST report] a new law that would have decriminalized abortion if a pregnant woman's life was at risk, thus reinstating a total ban on abortion within the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/06/09/10-56971.pdf">held</a> [decision, PDF] Thursday that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms. The court, reversing a <a href="/forum/2014/12/glenn-smith-peruta-intervention.php">prior 2014 decision</a> [JURIST op-ed], upheld California's current restriction requiring citizens to demonstrate "good cause" for having a concealed handgun. The court majority stated that, because the Second Amendment does not provide protection to carry a concealed firearm in public, "any prohibition or restriction a state may choose to impose ... is necessarily allowed by the Amendment." The California <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=26001-27000&file=26150-26225">law</a> [materials] has been a point of contention within the state. In particular those opposed to the law believe the term "good cause" should include personal protection. Only those individuals who require a heightened sense of security, such as citizens who frequently carry large amounts of cash or who are being stalked, can justify personal protection as being "good cause." This ruling stands against the dissent's cries that it "obliterates the Second Amendment's right to bear a firearm in some manner in public for self-defense." The decision left open the possibility that carrying a firearm openly in public might fall within the purview of the Second Amendment.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Last month the Ninth Circuit held that the Second Amendment <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-second-amendment-protects-right-to-buy-and-sell-guns.php">protects the right to buy and sell guns</a> [JURIST report]. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case addressing firearm possession for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] South African President Jacob Zuma, along with the state prosecutor, began an appeal on Friday of a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-high-court-orders-review-of-783-corruption-charges-against-president-zuma.php">reinstating 783 corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against him. The charges were initially dropped by the <a href="https://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> (NPA) [official website] in 2009, opening his bid for the presidency. The High Court last April ordered a review of the decision of the "irrational" decision by the NPA. NPA officials, including NPA lawyer Hilton Epstein, believe the court exceeded its authority and that the prosecutors have a certain discretion in deciding when to bring charges. The NPA believes the decision of the High Court will dilute their own power. The corruption <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36357032">charges are linked</a> [BBC report] to Zuma's alleged participation in a 1999 arms deal worth billions of dollars and are believed by Zuma to be an attempt to thwart his chances in the upcoming presidential election. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called the appeal a delaying tactic.</p>

<p>The South African president has been embroiled in legal trouble for the past several months. Zuma <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-president-zuma-beats-impeachment.php">evaded impeachment</a> [JURIST report] in April after the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC) [official website] reaffirmed its support for the president. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in March that he had ignored the order of the Public Protector to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence. Zuma has been at the center of political controversy for years. Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> [JURIST report] as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but he was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">acquitted and reinstated</a> [JURIST report] as African National Congress deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">November 2007 decision</a> by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>ICC prosecutor: UN Security Council has failed in not arresting Sudan president</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official websites] have been "conspicuous[ly] silent" in response to the prosecutor office's calls to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=160609-otp-stat-UNSC">said</a> [report] ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on Thursday. She stated that despite "countless appeals to [the UN Security Council] to address the persistent failure Sudan to comply with its international obligations," the calls have gone unheeded by both the Council and the ICC. She argues that this failure has only been amplified by the fact that Sudan's president has been documented to have traveled across international borders, despite having two arrest warrants against him. Several States, including some signatories of the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [materials, PDF], have assisted Bashir's travel. The non-execution of the arrest warrants, along with "lack of access to Sudan's territory [and] resource constraints" have significantly <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54187#.V1rgLvkgs2z">hampered investigation</a> [UN News Centre] into the situation in Darfur. Bensouda stated that "this Council must no longer tolerate the continuing deteriorating humanitarian situation in Darfur," where there has been an increase in aerial bombings, ground warfare, and sexual crimes.</p>

<p>In September the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/icc-asks-south-africa-to-explain-failure-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that South Africa provide an explanation for the country's failure to arrest Bashir when he was in the country last June. During Bashir's visit a judge for South Africa's high court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/south-africa-court-bars-sudan-president-from-leaving-country.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] barring him from leaving the country. In March of last year the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icc-seeking-un-help-in-bashir-genocide-prosecution.php">requested assistance</a> [JURIST report] from the Security Council in affecting the arrest of Bashir. In asking the Council to take "necessary measures" to force Sudan to comply with the ICC investigation, the court noted that without such assistance, the Council's decision to request investigation into Bashir in 2005 would "never achieve its ultimate goal." In February 2015 African leaders <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/icc-should-drop-cases-against-al-bashir-ruto-african-leaders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to drop cases against Bashir and Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto or suspend the charges until African concerns are considered by the court. In December 2014 Bensouda told the Security Council that her office was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/icc-prosecutor-halts-darfur-investigation.php">dropping further investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the situation in Darfur.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the US House of Representatives approved bi-partisan legislation to relieve financial pressure on Puerto Rico on Thursday. The statute, entitled the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20160606/CPRT-114-HPRT-RU00-HR5278.pdf">Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act of 2016</a> (PROMESA) [text, PDF], creates a financial oversight board and will restructure a portion of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt. Deemed as an unfortunate, but necessary consequence to rescuing the territory from its financial crisis, the minimum wage for young workers has been reduced as well. The implications of this bill are wide-reaching, especially in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in <a href=/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-against-puerto-rico-in-double-jeopardy-case.php">Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle</a> [JURIST report] and the pending Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-puerto-rico-bankruptcy-case.php">Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust</a> [JURIST reports], which affirm that Puerto Rico does not have complete sovereignty. The oversight board, which would be unelected, has been as <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/puerto-rico-news-ruling-promesa/486392/">cause for concern</a> [<em>The Atlantic</em> report] by some. Raúl Grijalva, the ranking Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, made it known that he believes this bill is yet "another infringement on the sovereignty of the people of Puerto Rico," in particular the lack of Puerto Rico representation on the board oversight board and, most importantly, the continued distinction between Puerto Rico and states.This legal distinction strips from Puerto Rico the ability to use bankruptcy to restructure its debt, a method available to all US states.</p>

<p>The Puerto Rico legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/puerto-rico-legislature-approve-bill-for-fiscal-emergency.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] this April, marking its first step towards debt moratorium. At the end of 2015, Puerto Rico was $70 billion dollars in debt. The governor anticipated a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-28/which-puerto-rico-bond-defaults-next-42-yields-provide-a-clue">government default</a> [Bloomberg report] in 2016, which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/business/dealbook/puerto-rico-defaults-on-debt-payments.html?_r=0">came to fruition</a> [NYT report] on January 4. The territory has been suffering from a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35368786">massive recession</a> [BBC report] since 2006, nearly a decade before the governor announced that Puerto Rico was unable to pay its debts. However, the Puerto Rico Electronic Power Authority, a major player in the economic crisis, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-24/puerto-rico-electric-wins-debt-restructuring-deal-with-creditors">reached a deal</a> [Bloomberg report] to restructure its debt in December. This deal is the first of many restructuring plans to alleviate the government's debt. In February, the Puerto Rico Legislature <a href="http://www.tucamarapr.org/dnncamara/Documents/Measures/66728140-f770-48c7-bb47-660163e60d49.pdf">passed a bill</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] that would restructure the island's <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/puerto-rico-could-pass-debt-restructuring-bill.php">estimated $9 billion debt</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20082&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press briefing] a recent string of rocket and mortar attacks against residential areas and markets in Taizz, Yemen, from June 3 to June 8. The attacks, perpetrated just weeks before Ramadan, killed 18 civilians and injured 68 others. While there is no official record of from whom and where the attacks came, it is believed that attacks were directed by the Popular Committees associated with the Houthis and other groups loyal to former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13179385">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [BBC profile], who are currently in control of Tabat Al-Sofitel hill. The attacks continued in the Al Ta'iziyah and Al-Qahirah districts from June 4 to June 6, and later culminated in the shelling of Al-Thawrah hospital, where five people were killed on June 8. The hospital had been sheltering individuals attempting to find safety from the recent violence. The press briefing later went on to discuss recent killing of four Israelis in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. In March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-yemen-conflict-to-swallow-their-pride.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Saudi Arabian coalition forces in Yemen for the more than 3,000 civilian casualties resulting from the conflict in just the past year. Also in March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the civilian death toll in Yemen had reached nearly 2,800. In January the UN World Food Programme appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to allow the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php">safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into possible war crimes surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of five doctors and the <a href="http://ethicalhealthcare.org/">American Academy of Medical Ethics</a> (AAME) [advocacy website] <a href="https://lifelegaldefense.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2016-0608-conformed-plaintiffs-ex-parte.pdf">filed suit</a> [application, PDF] Wednesday challenging a physician-assisted suicide law. The <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB128">End of Life Option Act</a> would allow "terminally-ill" patients, an individual who, determined within reasonable medical certainty, is going to die in 60 days due to an incurable disease, to be given a prescription for a lethal dose of "aid-in-dying" drugs. Those challenging the legislation argue that, "[t]he Act violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the California Constitution in that it fails to make rational distinctions between ['terminally ill' citizens] , and the vast majority of Californians not covered by the Act." They argue that the term "terminally ill" is unconstitutionally vague and for that reason the law would "deprive[] individuals the protection of previously-existing California laws against assisted suicide by unconstitutionally creating a class of persons again based on arbitrary, unreasonable, and irrational distinctions." Finally, they argue that the legislature lacked constitutional authority to legislate on the matter of physician-assisted suicide during an extraordinary legislative session.</p>

<p>The aid-in-dying movement has garnered substantial legal debate around the world in the past few years. In the US, four states currently have legislation that allow physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to some patients: California, Oregon, Washington and Vermont. In Montana the state's highest court has ruled that assisted suicide is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">not explicitly banned</a> [JURIST report] by state law or public policy, meaning consent could be raised as a defense in a potential prosecution of a physician. In July California lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/california-lawmakers-drop-right-to-die-bill.php">ended a previous legislative effort</a> [JURIST report] to enact the End of Life Option Act, as the former right-to-die bill had been amended several times over the previous year. The law was hotly debated when 29-year-old <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/opinion/maynard-assisted-suicide-cancer-dignity/">Brittany Maynard</a> [CNN backgrounder] moved from San Francisco to Oregon, which allows physician-assisted suicide, so that she could die on her own terms after being diagnosed with brain cancer. Last June the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="201/paperchase/2015/06/europe-rights-court-backs-france-decision-upholding-paralyzed-mans-right-to-die.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a French court's decision allowing Vincent Lambert the right to die, stating it did not violate article 2 of European Convention on Human Rights. In May 2015 a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/dutch-court-clears-man-who-assisted-in-dying-mothers-suicide.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother in committing suicide. Also that month, an 84-year old attorney, businessman and political candidate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/terminally-ill-nashville-lawyer-challenges-tennessee-ban-on-assisted-suicide.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Tennessee, challenging a law that makes it a felony for a doctor or another person to help someone commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US magistrate judge issued an <a href="/paperchase/Shiloh%20v.%20Beard.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] on Thursday requiring California prisons to provide transgender inmates who identify as female access to female-oriented items to which inmates have access in women's correctional facilities. The order lists pajamas, robes, sandals, scarves, chains, necklaces, pumice stones and emery boards as items which are appropriate to give to such individuals. Not all items available in female correctional facilities were included in the order, as the judge found that bracelets, earrings, hair brushes and hair clips could pose "significant safety and security concerns." The order arose in the case in Shiloh Quine, who <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-prison-officials-announce-criteria-for-inmates-seeking-sex-reassignment-surgery.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with California prison officials last August in which the state agreed to pay for her sex reassignment surgery.</p>

<p>Discrimination based on gender identity has been a controversial issue in the US and internationally. In May the Canadian Prime Minister <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">proposed legislation</a>[JURIST report] that would ban discrimination against transgender people. In April a labor arbitration panel in China <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-arbitration-panel-hears-first-transgender-job-discrimination-suit.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] the first transgender job discrimination suit in the country. In March Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/arkansas-ag-to-appeal-ruling-upholding-local-anti-discrimination-ordinance.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a judge' s decision upholding an ordinance that protects members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community from discrimination. A day earlier North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">not defend</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials], which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Venice Commission: Poland surveillance powers reach too far</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In an opinion issued on Friday, the Venice Commission announced that it believes Poland's current <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&id=2433683&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&direct=true">surveillance powers are too broad</a> [press release] and need to be checked. The opinion focuses on sections 19 and 20c of the <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-REF(2016)036-e">Police Act</a> [text, PDF], dealing with "classical" surveillance and the collection of metadata respectively.  The Commission believes that certain metadata, such as web-logs, are so extremely sensitive that judicial authorization should be required to obtain them. For other, less sensitive metadata, the commission suggested creating a independent oversight body to monitor the specific metadata operations, as opposed to the current, inefficient "generalized reporting" which is required every six months. The Commission also called for the prevention of surveillance violating lawyer-client communications, limiting the duration of metadata monitoring, and requiring police to keep formal records so as to aid in the future monitoring operations.</p>

<p>Surveillance and data collection have been a worldwide topic of discussion, particularly after Edward Snowden <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">leaked top-secret</a> [JURIST report] US National Security Agency (NSA) documents in 2013. Last month a UN rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-warn-uk-bill-could-threaten-freedom-of-expression.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Investigatory Powers Bill, stating it could threaten freedom of expression and association. In December China <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/china-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">passed a new anti-terrorism law</a> [JURIST report] that requires technology companies to provide information to the government obtained from their products and make information systems "secure and controllable." In October the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-block-bulk-phone-data-collection.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the American Civil Liberties Union to halt the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA. The court ruled that Congress intended for the agency to continue its data collection over the transition period, and the new legislation was to take effect November 29. In June the French Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/france-parliament-adopts-new-surveillance-bill.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a new surveillance bill that would give French intelligence serves the authority to monitor Internet use metadata. In February the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of citizens' Internet use violates human rights law. In July 2014 civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK's Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6, alleging that the agency accesses data from undersea cables in violation of the rights to private life and freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Edmund Brown </a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19451">signed</a> [press release] a bill into law on Friday that attempts to allow undocumented immigrants to purchase healthcare plans. The bill, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_10_bill_20160610_chaptered.html">SB 10</a> [text] , allows the healthcare exchanges set up in the state to seek a waiver from the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] to ensure that individuals who are able to afford healthcare but cannot due to their immigration status are legally able to purchase plans offered in conjunction with the <a href="http://housedocs.house.gov/energycommerce/ppacacon.pdf">Affordable Care Act (ACA)</a> [text, PDF]. SB 10 would only require the collection of pertinent information in order to establish identity to allow those with an undocumented status to purchase plans without their immigration status being a factor. The bill also mandates that individuals who purchase healthcare under the waiver do so without state and federal assistance or intervention. The bill asks for immediate relief from the federal government in order to ensure the peace and health of the public. </p>

<p>Immigration policy and the ACA, the two issued directly addressed by SB 10, are highly contested domestic policy platforms of the Obama administration. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-judge-rules-in-favor-of-challenge-to-affordable-healthcare-act.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of House Republicans in a challenge to the ACA. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="h/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-immigration-policy.php">heard</a> [JURIST report] oral arguments also in April in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/15-674_h3dj.pdf">United States v. Texas</a> [transcript, PDF] on the Obama administration's controversial immigration policy. Last week the <a  href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-vacate-sanctions-in-immigration-dispute.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] a federal appeals court to vacate the sanctions imposed by a district judge, which are part of the ongoing immigration debate where 26 states sued over the immigration policy. The <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-order-doj-lawyers-to-ethics-class.php">sanctions</a> [JURIST report] require any DOJ lawyer appearing in court in any of the 26 states to undergo a mandatory ethics class.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">cautioned</a> [press release] Israel that their response to the deadly Tel Aviv attack earlier this week may be violating international law by implementing prohibitive collective punishment. The Israeli government cancelled 83,000 travel permits to Gaza and West Bank residents, preventing Palestinians residents from traveling to Israel during Ramadan. They also suspended 204 work permits previously granted to the extended families of the alleged attackers. The High Commissioner condemned the deadly attacks against Israel and expressed that they have an obligation to bring the perpetrators to justice but not to punish possibly thousands of innocent Palestinians in the process. He stated:<blockquote>We are also deeply concerned at the response of the Israeli authorities, which includes measures that may amount to prohibited collective punishment and will only increase the sense of injustice and frustration felt by Palestinians in this very tense time. The response has included . . .  the sealing off of their entire home town by the Israeli security forces.</blockquote>  The attack that triggered the permit action occurred on Wednesday when four Israelis were killed by gunfire and several more were injured. </p>

<p>The increase in violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created a contentious human rights situation. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released </a> [JURIST report] closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force  by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An Israeli court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">convicted</a>[JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.senate.michigan.gov/default.html">Michigan Senate</a> [official website] on Thursday passed a <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/billengrossed/Senate/pdf/2015-SEBS-0291.pdf">bill</a> (SB 291) [text, PDF] that would compensate people who were wrongfully convicted of crimes once they are <a href="http://www.dailytribune.com/article/DT/20160610/NEWS/160619953">exonerated</a> [Daily Tribune report]. SB 291, also known as the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Act, passed the Senate by a unanimous vote and will now go to the state's House of Representatives. The goal of the bill is to eliminate an expensive and difficult legal battle to receive compensation for wrongful imprisonment. However, if a sentence for a separate crime related to the same event as the wrongful conviction is upheld, the bill is rendered inapplicable. SB 291 provides $50,000 for every year that someone was wrongfully incarcerated, but a separate claim must be made for compensation regarding any injuries suffered while in prison. This would make Michigan one of many states providing such assistance.</p>

<p>The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] has been a matter of ongoing concern in the US, and the rights of convicted felons are an important part of the issue. In April US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that states should make it easier for convicted felons to obtain state-issued identification cards upon their <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/lynch-states-should-make-it-easier-for-felons-to-obtain-id.php">release from prison</a> [JURIST report]. Also in April Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-governor-restores-voting-rights-for-ex-felons.php">restored the voting rights</a> [JURIST report] of individuals who have completed the terms of incarceration and have been released from supervised probation or parole for any and all felony convictions. In March the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and the Ohio Justice and Policy Center <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-groups-recommend-criminal-justice-reform.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] with recommendations on reforming the criminal justice system in Ohio, and one of the discussions focuses dealt with releasing innocent people. In February 2015 Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf declared a <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/pennsylvania-governor-announces-death-penalty-moratorium.php">moratorium on the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], citing inadequate procedures to protect the innocent as one of the major concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Bangladesh detained approximately 1,600 people between Thursday and Friday in efforts to find and detain radical Islamist militants. Police <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/11/world/asia/ap-as-bangladesh-crackdown.html?_r=1">suspect</a> [NYT report] only 37 of the detainees are more than petty criminals, none of whom are believed to be "high-level operators." The raids were a response to multiple attacks in Bangladesh over the last few years, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has faced criticism regarding security for minorities and failure to prosecute suspects of the attacks. Victims include atheist journalists, foreign aid workers, professors, gay rights activists and religious minorities including Christians, Hindus and Shiite Muslims. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has also criticized the government for <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/04/bangladesh-authorities-fail-to-curb-brutal-killing-spree-as-lgbti-editor-hacked-to-death/">failing to provide adequate safeguards</a> [AI report]. Opposition groups in the country also expressed concern that the government would use campaigns like this to suppress opposition.</p>

<p>In April Bangladesh's minister of law told the press that the arrest of a well-known magazine editor, Shafik Rahman, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/bangladeshs-official-denies-political-motivations-for-arrest-of-prominent-magazine-editor.php">not politically motivated</a> [JURIST report]. Also in April former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/former-bangladesh-pm-granted-bail-in-bus-attack-case.php">surrendered to a court</a> [JURIST report] after an arrest warrant was issued against her in connection with the firebombing bus attack last year staged in opposition of the government. In March the Bangladesh Supreme Court found two ministers guilty of contempt after they had publicly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-supreme-court-finds-two-ministers-guilty-of-contempt.php">criticized the chief justice of the court</a> [JURIST report]. Also in March the Bangladesh high court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-high-court-denies-petition-to-remove-islam-as-state-religion.php">threw out a petition</a> [JURIST report] introduced by secular activists that sought the removal of Islam as the state religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge from <a href="http://courts.oregon.gov/multnomah/Pages/index.aspx">Multnomah County Circuit Court</a>  [official website] in Oregon <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/315373637/Order-Legal-Sex-Change-from-Female-to-Nonbinary#fullscreen">ruled</a> [text, PDF] on Friday that an individual's gender could be legally changed from from female to non-binary. This ruling legally recognizing a third gender option is the first of its kind in the United States. Army veteran Jamie Shupe <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/06/oregon_court_allows_person_to.html">petitioned the court</a> [Oregonian report] for this change because the binary distinctions of male and female did not reflect Jamie's correct gender identity. Under Oregon law, a court can change a person's legal sex if the judge determines that the individual has undertaken some treatment related to gender transitioning, but no doctor's note is required.</p>

<p>Gender identity and expression are at the center of an international legal conversation about the rights and protections afforded to LGBT individuals.  In June a US magistrate judge issued an order <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-transgender-inmate-must-be-given-access-to-female-items.php">requiring </a> [JURIST report] California prisons to provide transgender inmates who identify as female access to female-oriented items in women's correctional facilities. Also in June Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski filed a <a href="http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/09132201/Tennessee-Counseling-Lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the Chancery Court for Anderson County, <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/gay-men-challenge-tennessee-counseling-law.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] a Tennessee law that protects counselors who refuse to provide services to individuals based on their religious beliefs. Canadian Prime Minister <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng">Justin Trudeau</a> [official website] introduced legislation in May that would <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">ban</a> [JURIST report] transgender discrimination, including it within Canada's hate crime laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] on Sunday released a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/how-the-ilo-works/ilo-director-general/statements-and-speeches/WCMS_488485/lang--en/index.htm">statement</a> [text] calling for the world to end child labor in <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54203#.V12DhrsrLIV">supply chains</a> [UN News Centre report] such as agriculture, mining and manufacturing. The statement was made on the annual World Day against Child Labour, and ILO <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/how-the-ilo-works/ilo-director-general/lang--en/index.htm">Director-General Guy Ryder</a> [official profile] cited 168 million children in child labor, 85 million of whom are in hazardous work. Ryder also stated that rural and informal economies are usually the largest contributors due to the lack of institutional regulation and the prevalence of small family enterprises such as family-run farms. Ryder also detailed three legislative focuses that would help eliminate child labor. "Governments are recognizing that the fight against child labour requires coherent policy packages to back child labour legislation: quality education, social protection and decent jobs for parents," Ryder stated. Overall, Ryder is confident that local, national and global trends are pushing towards the elimination of child labor.</p>

<p>In recent years child labor laws have become a growing subject of international attention. In the US, federal regulations like the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [PDF] are the major controlling factor of child labor. In April 2015 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/04/13/ripe-abuse/palestinian-child-labor-israeli-agricultural-settlements-west-bank">reported</a> [text] that Israeli settlement farmers in the occupied West Bank are using Palestinian child laborers in dangerous conditions in <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-israel-settlement-farmers-violating-international-child-labor-laws.php">violation of international laws</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2014 the Bolivian National Congress passed legislation <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/bolivia-lowers-child-labor-age-restriction.php">permitting</a> [JURIST report] children as young as 10 to join the workforce as long as it does not interfere with one's education and is done independently in an effort to provide for their family. In 2013 the ILO released a report on child labor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-group-social-protections-key-to-ending-child-labor.php">advocating social protections</a> [JURIST report] as the key to ending the practice. "[The] report contributes to a better understanding of the underlying economic and social vulnerabilities that generate child labour."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-233_i42j.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-2 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/puerto-rico-v-franklin-california-tax-free-trust/">Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/903">Section 903(1)</a> [text] of the Bankruptcy Code preempts Puerto Rico's Recovery Act. The federal bankruptcy code preempts state bankuptcy laws that enable insolvent municipalities to restructure their debts over the objections of creditors and instead requires municipalities to restructure such debts under Chapter 9 of the code. The question before the court was whether Puerto Rico is a "state" for purposes of the preemption provision. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court held that it is. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the consideration of the case.</p>

<p>Monday's ruling puts increased pressure on Puerto Rico to resolve its financial issues. Last week members of the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/us-house-approves-bill-to-address-puerto-rico-financial-crisis.php">approved bi-partisan legislation</a> [JURIST report] to relieve financial pressure on Puerto Rico.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Romania's <a href="http://www.scj.ro/">High Court of Cassation and Justice</a> [official website, in Romanian] ruled Monday that an investigation into the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/574200.stm">1989 revolution</a> [BBC backgrounder] can reopened. The prosecutor general's office said in October that the investigation into the events of December 1989, in which 1,104 people were killed, would be <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/06/13/romania-court-rules-18-revolution-probe-will-be-reopened.html">classified</a> [AP report], declining to prosecute anyone. Interim prosecutor general Bogdan Licu sought in April to reopen the investigation. The court agreed Monday that the investigation can be <a href="http://www.romania-insider.com/romania-reopens-1989-revolution-case/">reopened</a> [Romania Insider report].</p>

<p>The Romanian revolution brought about the fall on Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. After protests reached the capital, Ceausescu and his wife fled but were eventually caught, tried and executed. The protesters faced violent repression, and more than 1,000 were killed, with many others injured or detained. Many members of the former Communist regime retained their roles in the government, and there has been reluctance to launch a full-scale investigation into the events.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-420_5425.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-bryant/">United States v. Bryant</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the use of tribal-court convictions as predicate offenses in substitute prosecution does not necessarily violate the constitution. The court held that when such convictions occur in proceedings under the <a href="http://www.tribal-institute.org/lists/icra1968.htm">Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968</a> [text], those convictions were valid when entered. The case revolved around whether a conviction in an Indian tribal court without counsel satisfied <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/117">18 USC § 117</a> [text]. The court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-no-constitutional-violation-from-use-of-tribal-court-convictions-as-predicate-offenses/">found</a> [SCOTUSBlog report] that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to tribal-court proceedings, as under the 1968 law, a lawyer is only required to be appointed for criminal defendants who are sentenced for more than a year in prison; which Bryant was not. As such, since the convictions were valid when entered, the court ruled that they must also be valid today. This ruling is consistent with the court's stance that "laws which are intended to penalize repeat offenders only punish 'the last offense committed by the defendant'; they 'do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction.'"</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-indian-tribal-courts-false-claims-act.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the matter in April. The case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-420">arose</a> [Oyez summary] after Michael Bryant, Jr. was convicted on two counts of domestic abuse under § 117 where the two predicate offenses were his convictions in Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. Bryant moved for dismissal, claiming that the convictions violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments because they were without counsel. This opinion reversed and remanded an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/12-30177.pdf">opinion</a> [opinion, PDF] from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] vacated and remanded a <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Federal Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] decision on Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/halo-electronics-inc-v-pulse-electronics-inc/">Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1513_db8e.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] in a unanimous decision that the federal circuit was too lax with its discretion in awarding enhanced damages but that the <a href="https://e-foia.uspto.gov/Foia/RetrievePdf?system=FCA&flNm=07-830_1">Seagate</a> [opinion, PDF] test is too rigid with too many holes for infringers to slip through. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/284">35 USC §284</a> [text] provides that a district court "may increase damages awarded to a patentee in an infringement claim, up to three times the amount found or assessed." The Federal Circuit's <span class="casename">Seagate</span> test created a two-prong analysis for deciding willful infringement. The test asked the court to find 1) that infringement occured "despite an objectively high likelihood" that the accused infringer's actions constituted infringement, and 2)that the risk of infringement "was either known or so obvious that is should have been known to the accused infringer." The federal courts in this matter refused to provide enhanced rewards regardless of the tests. The Supreme Court vacated these decisions. The court held that discretion is part of the statute when it states that a court "may" award enhanced damages, but that "discretion is not a whim." The court ruled that enhanced damages are not appropriate in the typical infringement case but warranted for "egregious infringement behavior." The court found the <span class="casename">Seagate</span> test to be "unduly rigid" while also allowing some of the worst infringers to escape under its "objective prong." The "<a href="http://www.patentdocs.org/2016/06/halo-electronics-inc-v-pulse-electronics-inc-and-stryker-corp-v-zimmer-inc-2016.html">threshold requirement</a>" [Patent Docs report] for finding willfulness liability under <span class="casename">Seagate</span> "excludes from discretionary punishment many of the most culpable offenders, such as the 'wanton and malicious pirate' who intentionally infringes another's patent&#8212;with no doubts about its validity or any notion of a defense&#8212;for no purpose other than to steal the patentee's business."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-over-proving-interstate-commerce-under-the-hobbs-act.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the matter in February. It had consolidated the case with <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/stryker-corp-v-zimmer-inc/">Stryker Corp. v. Zimmer</a> [SCOTUSBlog profile]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-to-hear-cases-on-patent-infringement-damages.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in October. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/">Judicial Watch</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/document-archive/major-v-mcauliffe-va-felons-voting-complaint-cl16000358-00/">lawsuit</a> [complaint; <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-sues-virginia-gov-mcauliffe-executive-order-granting-206000-felons-voting-rights/">press release</a>] Tuesday challenging an executive order by Virginia <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Terry McAuliffe</a> [official website] restoring the voting rights of certain felons. McAuliffe signed an executive order in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-governor-restores-voting-rights-for-ex-felons.php">restoring the voting rights</a> [JURIST report] of individuals who have completed the terms of incarceration and have been released from supervised probation or parole for any and all felony convictions. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Bedford County on behalf of several voters:<blockquote>Plaintiffs are registered voters in the Commonwealth of Virginia. As a result of Defendants' unlawful actions, 206,000 felons who, by law, should be ineligible to vote, are being, and will be, registered and permitted to vote. Unless an injunction is granted, Plaintiffs lawful votes will be cancelled out, and their voting power will be diluted, by votes cast by individuals who are not eligible to vote under Virginia&#8217;s laws and Constitution.</blockquote>This is the second lawsuit against the order, following a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gop-sues-to-strip-209k-felons-from-va-voter-rolls/2016/05/23/ef2587a8-20e4-11e6-aa84-42391ba52c91_story.html">similar challenge</a> [WP report] by Republican lawmakers.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In April a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a bill that will <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In response to the mass killing in Orlando, the UN's top human rights official on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20093&amp;LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the US to increase its gun control measures. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54218#.V2FPprsrKUk">stated</a> [UN News Centre report] that the US must "live up to its obligations to protect its citizens from the 'horrifyingly commonplace but preventable violent attacks that are the direct result of insufficient gun control.'" This coincides with a new UN human rights <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/078/72/PDF/G1607872.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] that highlights the impact of gun violence on human rights. This comes after 49 people were <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/">killed</a> [CNN report] by a single gunman in a gay nightclub in Florida over the weekend.

<a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Last month the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Second Amendment protects the <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-second-amendment-protects-right-to-buy-and-sell-guns.php">right to buy and sell guns</a> [JURIST report]. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case addressing firearm possession for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3F95E49183E6F8AF85257FD200505A3A/$file/15-1063-1619173.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the net-neutrality regulations designed to ensure an open Internet. Last year the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] passed <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/fcc-chairman-proposes-regulating-internet-like-a-public-utility.php">new rules</a> [JURIST report] that prevent service providers from offering speedier lands to those willing to pay extra. This caused controversy between businesses such as <a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> and <a href="https://ir.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> with service providers like <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/investor-relations?pid=5711">AT&T</a>, <a href="http://www.verizon.com/about/">Verizon</a> and <a href="http://corporate.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> [company website]. There has been additional concern that while all customers have not been treated equally neither has all content. This has occurred as a result of various providers offering free data for viewing certain web videos over others. In its decision, the appeals court likened Internet service providers to utilities, saying that they should act as "neutral, indiscriminate platforms for transmission of speech." AT&T has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-14/fcc-s-net-neutrality-rules-upheld-by-u-s-court-of-appeals">stated</a> [Bloomberg report] its intention to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/2015/04/legal-conflict-over-net-neutrality.php">Net neutrality</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has emerged as a major political issue in the US and internationally. In November 2014 US President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality">said</a> [statement] that he strongly supports the concept of net neutrality. In May 2014 the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/fcc-approves-new-internet-traffic-rules.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] new Internet traffic rules in light of a court <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/3AF8B4D938CDEEA685257C6000532062/$file/11-1355-1474943.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that struck down former rules requiring broadband providers to employ nondiscriminatory practices in the treatment of Internet content. In April 2014 the European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/european-parliament-approves-net-neutrality-proposal.php#.U1qsYP3-VFx">approved</a> [JURIST report] a net neutrality proposal that prohibits Internet service providers from enhancing or restricting services for selected Internet traffic. The proposed law, approved by a 534-25 vote with 58 abstentions, aims to treat all Internet traffic equally by making it illegal to block, slow down or give preferential treatment to certain specific applications and services for economic or other reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Council of Europe <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner">Commissioner for Human Rights Nils Muižnieks</a> [official website] <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&InstranetImage=2924182&SecMode=1&DocId=2376250&Usage=2">reported</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday that Poland's legal and institutional framework <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/erosion-of-rule-of-law-threatens-human-rights-protection-in-poland">threatens human rights</a> [press release]. The Commissioner is particularly concerned with the "paralysis" of the constitutional court. The report also states that the new media laws are unprecedented and urges the government to implement reform. A governmental spokesperson declined to meet with the Commissioner, and the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&InstranetImage=2924413&SecMode=1&DocId=2378112&Usage=2">stated</a> [press release] that it has adhered to legislative procedures when implementing the current policies. </p>

<p>The PiS has made numerous controversial reforms since taking power last fall. Earlier this month the European Commission adopted a rule of law opinion on Poland, warning that changes to the country's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-warns-poland-over-constitutional-court-changes.php">pose a risk to the rule of law</a> [JURIST report]. The EU began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January. In February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that grants the government greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. The PiS, a conservative party elected in October, holds an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34648575">overwhelming majority</a> [BBC report] of positions in the Polish government including the lead in both parliamentary houses and the presidency. In December the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">to a coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. However, there is a larger concern in the EU that new Polish law will erode checks and balances on government powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Venezuelan government officials on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to deny a referendum to remove President Nicolas Maduro proposed by opposition leaders. Following the declaration by the  <a href="http://www.cne.gob.ve/web/index.php">National Electoral College</a> (CNE) [official website in Spanish] that more than 600,000 signatures found on the petition for the referendum were "invalid," those in support of Maduro, such as Jorge Rodriguez, accused opposition leaders of fraud. On Tuesday US <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/14/amid-oas-conference-kerry-adds-to-calls-for-maduro/">announced his support for the referendum</a> [<em>Washington Times</em> report], according to the Venezuelan government. Hours later, however, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oas-kerry-idUSKCN0Z027T">Kerry announced talks</a> [Reuters report] between the two nations in an attempt to "improve the relationship." It is unlikely that a referendum will take place this year. </p>

<p>There has been considerable legislative tension between the pro-government controlled Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the opposition-majority National Assembly of Venezuela following the December election. In April Venezuela's opposition-led parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/venezuela-congress-approves-new-referendum-rules.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new referendum rules. In March the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that the Venezuelan national assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-high-court-bans-national-congress-from-investigating-judicial-appointment.php">may not review the appointment of 13 justices</a> [JURIST report] to the high court by the Socialist Party. The 13 justices were sworn in on December 23, immediately prior to the exit of prior Socialist Party majority. In February the court upheld President Maduro's <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/venezuela-supreme-court-approves-presidents-emergency-decree.php">economic emergency decree </a>[JURIST report] as legal and valid despite a rejection by the national assembly. The decree allows the president to control the budget, companies and the currency. In January the Supreme Tribunal of Justice ruled that all decisions from the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-supreme-court-voids-all-assembly-decisions.php">opposition-led assembly would be void</a> [JURIST report] until three opposition lawmakers were removed from their seats. The court's decision came days after the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuelan-blockage-of-four-lawmakers-considered-judicial-coup.php">assembly swore in elected lawmakers that were temporarily barred by the court [</a>JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/venezuela-swears-in-3-elected-lawmakers-barred-by-supreme-court-ruling.php">reports</a>]. The ruling had suspended four elected lawmakers for their involvement in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/venezuela-socialist-party-challenges-recent-election-of-opposition-politicians.php">alleged election fraud last December</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bahraini court on Tuesday issued a three month suspension of the group <a href="http://alwefaq.net/cmsen/">Al-Wefaq</a>. [party website]. The court found that the group has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/bahraini-court-suspends-al-wefaq-opposition-group-160614133354700.html">engaged</a> [Al Jazeera] in "terrorism, extremism, and violence." The ban is pending a verdict to determine whether it will be required to dissolve or allowed to continue.</p>

<p>Political tensions remain high between the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=bahrain&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Bahrain government and Al-Wefaq</a> [JURIST news archive] following protests that began in 2011. Last February Bahrain's Ministry of Interior <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/bahrain-initiates-criminal-investigation-into-online-content-of-opposition-party.php">initiated a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged criminal content posted by the country's main opposition group, Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society. Also last year a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-experts-urge-bahrain-to-release-political-opposition-leader.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Bahrain government to release detained opposition leader Sheikh Ali Salman. The human rights experts criticized the arrest and prosecution as a violation of Salman's right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of religion. In January of 2015 the Bahrain Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/prominent-shiite-leader-faces-trial-in-bahrain.php">commenced</a> [JURIST report] the trial of Salman for his role in promoting an overthrow of the current Bahrain political system. Salman was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/bahrain-prosecutors-charge-prominent-shiite-leader.php">charged </a>[JURIST report] in January for inciting a change of regime by non-peaceful means. In October 2014 a Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/bahraini-court-suspends-main-opposition-group.php">court ordered</a> [JURIST report] Al-Wefaq to suspend all activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=180083&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=1006365">rejected</a> [judgment] a challenge to Britain's refusal to pay family welfare benefits to unemployed EU migrants who do not have the right to reside in the UK. The judges ruled that such unequal treatment is justified on the basis of protecting a member state's finances. The European Commission argued that Britain's actions were discriminatory. However, the court disagreed finding nothing preventing the UK from requiring immigrants to be legal residents in order to be eligible for welfare benefits. The right to reside test allows migrant workers to move freely, promoting freedom to work, yet does not grant these individuals a claim to benefits. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issue around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Last week the ECJ ruled that non-EU immigrants who illegally enter the Schengen area across an internal border <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-of-justice-holds-that-immigrants-that-illegally-cross-schengen-area-cannot-be-imprisoned-so.php">should not be jailed</a> [JURIST report] solely on that basis. In March the ECJ ruled that Germany may place <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">"residence conditions"</a> [JURIST report] on refugees. In February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are too restrictive and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">place undue hardships</a> [JURIST report] on refugees and asylum-seekers. Also in February Amnesty International warned Austria that they are violating human rights through their daily <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-austria-cap-on-asylum-seekers-violates-human-rights.php">cap on asylum applications</a> [JURIST report]. In January Danish lawmakers approved a controversial bill that will allow Danish authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/denmark-lawmakers-approve-seizure-of-asylum-seekers-assets.php">seize assets</a> [JURIST report] from immigrants seeking asylum in order to cover their expenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-375_4f57.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Thursday in  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kirtsaeng-v-john-wiley-sons-inc-2/">Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] on the standard for awarding attorney's fees under § 505 of the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copyright Act</a> [text]. Under the act, the district court is permitted to use its discretion in awarding attorney's fees to a prevailing party in a copyright action. The Second Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/op-below-kirtsaeng.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a finding that John Wiley's course of action in challenging Kirtsaeng's use of copyrighted material was objectively reasonable, but the Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower court:<blockquote>Section 505 of the Copyright Act provides that a district court "may ... award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party." ... The question presented here is whether a court, in exercising that authority, should give substantial weight to the objective reasonableness of the losing party's position. The answer, as both decisions below held, is  yes&#8212;the court should. But the court must also give due consideration to all other circumstances relevant to granting fees; and it retains discretion, in light of those factors, to make an award even when the losing party advanced a reasonable claim or defense. Because we are not certain that the lower courts here understood the full scope of that discretion, we return the case for further consideration of the prevailing party's fee application.</blockquote>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-attorneys-fees-patent-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> in this case in April after <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in January.</p>

<p>This is the second time this case has been before the Supreme Court. In 2013 the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-rules-copyrighted-works-can-be-sold-secondhand-abroad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109">"first sale" doctrine</a> [17 USC § 109(a)] applies to imported works. When Supap Kirtsaeng came to study at Cornell University, he realized that the same textbooks his peers used were sold at drastically lower prices in his home country of Thailand. He had his family buy the books for him, and he resold them to classmates, accruing approximately $100,000 in profit. </p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] in favor of a veteran-owned business in a challenge against the <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official website]. In 2006 Congress passed a bill that states the VA "shall" award contracts to veteran-owned small businesses if at least two such businesses bid on the work at a fair price. <a href="https://www.kingdomware.net/">Kingdomware</a> [website], an information technology firm owned by service-disabled Army veteran Timothy Barton, argued that the VA has an obligation to seek veteran-owned businesses, while the VA rebutted that it need only consider them in the scope of what is best to achieve its business goals. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of the VA, stating that the <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/?q=browsefar">Federal Acquisition Regulation</a> [text], the general procedures for government contracting, permit agencies significant leeway in deciding how best to allocate business resources. In an option by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court reversed:<blockquote>In this case, we consider whether the Department must use the Rule of Two every time it awards contracts or whether it must use the Rule of Two only to the extent necessary to meet annual minimum goals for contracting with veteran-owned small businesses. We conclude that the Department must use the Rule of Two when awarding contracts, even when the Department will otherwise meet its annual minimum contracting goals.</blockquote>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/surpeme-court-hears-arguments-on-veterans-benefits-exclusionary-rule.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in February. The court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-veterans-business-rights.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] last June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Supreme Court rules on contractor liability under False Claims Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-7_a074.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Thursday in  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/universal-health-services-v-united-states-ex-rel-escobar/">Universal Health Services v. United States ex rel. Escobar</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], a case dealing with fraud claims against federal contractors. The question before the court was whether the "implied certification test" under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3729">False Claims Act</a> [text] is valid and if so whether the relevant statute has to state explicitly the conditions of payment that the defendant allegedly failed to meet. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the court:<blockquote>We first hold that, at least in certain circumstances, the implied false certification theory can be a basis for liability. Specifically, liability can attach when the defendant submits a claim for payment that makes specific representations about the goods or services provided, but knowingly fails to disclose the defendant's noncompliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement. In these circumstances, liability may attach if the omission renders those representations misleading. </p>

<p>We further hold that False Claims Act liability for failing to disclose violations of legal requirements does not turn upon whether those requirements were expressly designated as conditions of payment. Defendants can be liable for violating requirements even if they were not expressly designated as conditions of payment. Conversely, even when a requirement is expressly designated a condition of payment, not every violation of such a requirement gives rise to liability. What matters is not the label the Government attaches to a requirement, but whether the defendant knowingly violated a requirement that the defendant knows is material to the Government's payment decision.</blockquote>The court remanded the case the the lower court for further proceedings.</p>

<p>The case arose when a young girl, Yarushka Rivera, visited Arbour Counseling Services, a counseling center for mental illnesses run by United Health Services. After receiving a diagnosis and being prescribed medicine for bipolar disorder from unlicensed practitioners, Yarushka died. The parents filed complaints against state agencies and then sued UHS under both the federal and state False Claims Acts. The district court held that they did not sufficiently plead the elements of falsity that claims under the False Claims Act require. The court of appeals reversed and held that they did. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-indian-tribal-courts-false-claims-act.php">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of independent UN human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20112&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] India on Thursday to repeal a law increasingly being used to obstruct civilian access to foreign funding. This news comes in the wake of a six-month suspension on the registration of the non-governmental organization (NGO) <a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org/">Lawyers Collective</a> [advocacy website], under the <a href="https://fcraonline.nic.in/home/PDF_Doc/FC-RegulationAct-2010-C.pdf">Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA)</a> [the Act, PDF]. The suspension was ordered based on allegations that its founders, human rights lawyers Indira Jaising and Anand Grover, used foreign funding for impermissible purposes in violation of FCRA provisions. Jaising was a former member of the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CEDAW/Pages/CEDAWIndex.aspx">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</a> (CEDAW), and Grover was the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health from 2008 to 2014. According to the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], despite detailed evidence provided by the NGOs to prove that all foreign contributions were spent and accounted for in compliance with the FCRA, the suspension was still imposed. The Special Rapporteurs stated:<blockquote>We are alarmed by reports that the suspension was politically motivated and was aimed at intimidating, delegitimising and silencing Lawyers Collective for their litigation and  criticism of the Government's policies. ... We are also concerned about procedural irregularities surrounding the order, including repeatedly leaked information to the press of suspension notices against the Lawyers Collective months before those were formally served to the NGO.</blockquote>Urging the government to reverse its decision and recognize the "invaluable contribution" of Jaising and Grover as human rights defenders in upholding constitutional values in India, the experts stated that India must "ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders and civil society, which play a critical role in holding the Government to account and buttressing the Indian democracy."</p>

<p>India has previously faced international criticism. In February the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/india-high-court-to-review-decision-banning-gay-sex.php">agreed to review</a> [JURIST report] its 2013 decision <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/india-supreme-court-reinstates-gay-sex-ban.php">reinstating</a> [JURIST report] an 1861 law prohibiting sex between consenting adults of the same sex. A month earlier, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/supporting_resources/human_rights_watch_letter_to_ministry_of_social_justice_and_empowerment_india.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/">Indian Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-comments-on-india-transgender-bill.php">urging</a> [JURIST report] it to strengthen provisions of the 2015 Rights of Transgender Persons Bill. Last August India, after widespread international criticism, <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/india-government-lifts-ban-on-most-pornography-sites.php">ordered Internet service providers</a> [JURIST report] to allow access to the 857 previously banned pornography and humor websites provided they did not include child pornography. Earlier last year India's Supreme Court <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2015-03-24_1427183283.pdf">struck down</a> [judgment, PDF] a law that gave authorities the power to jail people for offensive online posts. That ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/india-court-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-offensive-facebook-speech.php">welcomed and commended</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cia.gov">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2016-press-releases-statements/cia-releases-declassified-documents-related-to-former-detention-and-interrogation-program.html">declassified</a> [press release] 50 documents related to its detention and Interrogation program pursuant to a <a href="https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/foia.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] request. This several hundred-page <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/documents-related-former-detention-and-interrogation-program">release</a> [FOIA archive] covers internal CIA documents as well as other documents that were cited in the <a href="http://www.intelligence.senate.gov/">Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> [official website] report on the program. The files expose <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/newly-released-cia-files-expose-grim-details-of-agency-interrogation-program/2016/06/14/6d04a01e-326a-11e6-95c0-2a6873031302_story.html">details</a> [NYT report] about the agency's treatment of terrorism suspects after the 9/11 attacks. One account included a detailed internal investigation in the interrogation and death of Gul Rahman, a militant suspected of ties to al Qaeda, who died at a CIA prison in Afghanistan in 2002 after being doused with water and chained to a concrete floor as temperatures dropped below freezing. The files also include detailed descriptions of the inner workings of the CIA's "black site" prisons, messages from field officers who expressed misgivings about the treatment of detainees, secret memos objecting to medical treatments later condemned as torture, and mistaken arrests of innocent civilians and subsequently attempted cover-ups. The documents also include memos filed by senior CIA officials defending the interrogation program as saving thousands of lives. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which filed the request for the documents, stated that these documents "under­score the cruelty of the methods used in its secret, overseas black sites."</p>

<p>The use of torture as an interrogation technique has created many legal problems for the US government. Last April,  a federal judge from the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-rules-lawsuit-against-creators-of-cia-interrogation-program-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/27._defendants_motion_to_dismiss_1.08.16.pdf">lawsuit</a> [brief, PDF] against two former military psychologists who developed the CIA's interrogation program under George W. Bush may proceed. In February <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International USA</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-calls-for-medical-treatment-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of the accused 9/11 ringleaders, was in desperate need of medical care in a letter to the Pentagon. In the letter the agency stated that Hawsawi was in severe rectal distress due to interrogation methods that amounted to torture and that he had yet to receive adequate medical care. In December <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/hrw-urges-prosecution-of-cia-officials-for-post-911-torture.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the criminal prosecution of CIA and other US government officials for their participation in torture programs following the 9/11 terrorist attack. In August 2014 10 victims of the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=extraordinary%20rendition&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">CIA's extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive] signed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/cia-rendition-victims-urge-obama-to-name-them-in-senate-report.php">open letter</a> [JURIST report] to President Barack Obama urging him to declassify the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the program, which ultimately led to the release. JURIST Guest Columnist Benjamin G Davis of the University of Toledo College of Law recently <a href="/forum/2015/11/benjamin-davis-all-lives.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the barriers that survivors of torture face in obtaining redress through the US court system, which HRW hopes to eliminate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN: Islamic State committing genocide against Yazidi people</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN-mandated human rights inquiry reported Thursday that the Islamic State (IS) has been <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20113&LangID=E">committing genocide</a> [press release] against the Yazidi people, in addition to a carrying out a variety of other war crimes and human rights violations. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A_HRC_32_CRP.2_en.pdf">41-page report</a> [text, PDF], entitled "'They came to destroy': ISIS Crimes Against the Yazidis," which was based largely on IS in Syria, and included a factual and legal analysis detailing how the crimes of IS amounted to genocide and war crimes. In particular, the report focused on how IS had a "specific intent" to destroy the Yazidi people, citing the events of August 3, 2014, in which IS had "few military objectives" when they attacked Sinjar and Tel Afar. The article noted that IS had instead "focused their attention on capturing Yazidis." The report closed with recommendations urging states to utilize existing law and also called for the creation of protocols to protect the Yazidi people, prosecute those who attack them, and ensure that international human rights laws are followed.</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a>[JURIST] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also, in March the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">unanimously passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and calling for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that IS is in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">possession of a "large and lethal" arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks in Paris</a> [JURIST report] that killed more than 120 individuals. In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and urged the court to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">open a genocide investigation</a> [JURIST report] into IS actions in Northern Iraq.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Wednesday signed an <a href="http://projects.statesman.com/documents/?doc=2863235-Syria-Order">order</a> [text] rejecting Texas' <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-judge-rejects-texas-attempt-to-stop-syrian-refugee-resettlement.php">attempts to halt Syrian refugee</a> [JURIST report] resettlement in the state. The order provided a factual summary stating that because Texas "fails to state a plausible claim for relief" the court would dismiss the case. The court held that the Refugee Act did not "confer a private right of action for the States to enforce its provisions" and the Administrative Procedure Act did not "provide ... a cause of action because advance consultation under the Refugee Act is not 'agency action' within the meaning of the statute." The court also held that the Declaratory Judgment Act did not provide a cause of action. While the ruling has been praised by some, such as Jennifer Sime, senior vice president of US programs for the International Rescue Committee, as an affirmation of "America's proud history in providing refuge for the world's most vulnerable," it has not been lauded by all. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick believes that "the ruling will hamper state efforts to acquire necessary information before refugees arrive in Texas."</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issue around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. In March a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-judge-blocks-indiana-governors-order-barring-refugees.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Pence's order keeping Syrian refugees from settling in Indiana. In February the same federal judge in Texas preliminarily rejected the Texas lawsuit seeking to halt the federal resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The judge ruled that Texas officials had failed to show a "substantial threat of irreparable injury" in their request for an injunction to stop further Syrian refugee resettlement. Refugee resettlement is also controversial in Europe. Also in February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are too restrictive and place <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">undue hardships</a> [JURIST reports] on refugees and asylum-seekers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canada's Liberal government said Thursday that it would strike an amendment expanding the definition of who may seek physician-assisted suicide. The <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2803276/C-14-Medical-assistance-in-dying.pdf">bill</a> [bill, PDF], which was passed Wednesday by the <a href="http://sen.parl.gc.ca/portal/home-e.htm">Senate</a> [official website], would allow individuals that are not terminally ill to seek physician-assisted death. Current legislation only extends this right to terminally ill patients or those who face "reasonably foreseeable" death. Canada's Health Minister, Jane Philpott, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-government-rejects-broadening-of-assisted-suicide-bill-1466106700">stated</a> [WSJ report] that the amendments were "not appropriate at this time," particularly because they would put certain disadvantaged groups, like the elderly and disabled, at heightened risk. The current contentious atmosphere surrounding the bill follows in the wake of a Canadian Supreme Court <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.ca/documents/2015scc005.pdf">ruling</a> [judgment, PDF], in which the court held that individuals with "grievous and irremediable" medical conditions had a constitutional right to physician-assisted death, but did not provide a more detailed framework for determining which individuals fall within this category.</p>

<p>The aid-in-dying movement has garnered substantial legal debate around the world in the past few years. In the US, four states currently have legislation that allow physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to some patients: California, Oregon, Washington and Vermont. In Montana the state's highest court has ruled that assisted suicide is <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">not explicitly banned</a> [JURIST report] by state law or public policy, meaning consent could be raised as a defense in a potential prosecution of a physician. Last June the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/201/paperchase/2015/06/europe-rights-court-backs-france-decision-upholding-paralyzed-mans-right-to-die.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a French court's decision allowing Vincent Lambert the right to die, stating it did not violate article 2 of European Convention on Human Rights. In May 2015 a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/dutch-court-clears-man-who-assisted-in-dying-mothers-suicide.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother in committing suicide. Also that month, an 84-year old attorney, businessman and political candidate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/terminally-ill-nashville-lawyer-challenges-tennessee-ban-on-assisted-suicide.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Tennessee challenging a law that makes it a felony for a doctor or another person to help someone commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazil must place more emphasis on remedying and preventing business-related human rights violations, according to a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/32/45/Add.1">report</a> [text, PDF] presented Friday by the <a href="https://business-humanrights.org/en/working-group">UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights</a> [official website]. In its report, the Working Group focused upon several issues affected by business operations within the country, including the displacement of indigenous populations, increased death threats against human rights activists where "their rights are compromised by economic interests," and failure to effectively address both child and slave labor. While the Working Group noted several state-initiatives directed at remedying these current violations, including the National Program for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and the 1996 Program to Child Labor, it discussed several policies counter-intuitive to human rights in business. Among the most notable of these policies were an attempt by the Senate to weaken the definition of slave labour and an injunction against publishing a "dirty-list." The <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/english/the-federal-senate">Senate</a> [official website] had attempted to remove provisions including "degrading working conditions and exhaustive working hours." Publication of the "dirty-list," which listed companies found to be using slave labor in their supply-chain, and banned said companies from gaining government contracts, was suspended in 2014 by the president of the <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verConteudo.php?sigla=portalStfSobreCorte_en_us&idConteudo=120283">Supreme Court's</a> [official website] injunction, which is currently facing challenges by several human rights organizations. Brazil will likely continue to face publicized challenges to human rights violations on the cusp of the 2016 Olympics, set for this summer.</p>

<p>Large business ventures have been an issue in Brazil in recent history. Brazil recently filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-file-4355-billion-suit-over-dam-collapse.php">lawsuit against several mining companies</a> [JURIST report] in relation to a dam collapse earlier last year, which killed 19 people and polluted a vast 400 miles of the Rio Doce basin. In March a UN Special Rapporteur stated that while Brazil has made strides in protecting indigenous peoples, it <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-brazil-must-take-further-action-to-recognize-indigenous-peoples-rights.php">has not gone far enough</a> [JURIST report] to prevent ousting of indigenous peoples from their land. Brazil is also one among many countries that have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paris-agreement-states-urged-to-address-human-rights-issues.php">urged by the UN</a> [JURIST report] to remedy human rights violations arising out of the Paris Agreement, signed during the COP21.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Guatemalan president Otto Pérez Molina and former vice president Roxana Baldetti are among 70 people facing charges in relation to an scheme embezzling millions of dollars of government money. The most recent <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36556259">charges</a> [BBC report] for the pair, who are both facing charges resulting in their resignations, set out "illegal financing, embezzlement and money laundering." According to Prosecutor Julio Barrios, shell companies were used to hid the laundering and the "money was used to buy goods and services for [Pérez Molina] and Baldetti including real estate and luxury vehicles, as as $4.3 million in gifts." Baldetti is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/ex-guatemalan-president-and-vp-charged-in-corruption-scheme/2016/06/16/221c1026-3401-11e6-ab9d-1da2b0f24f93_story.html">alleged to have received $38 million in bribes</a> [Washington Post] between 2009 and 2015 for public work contracts. Both Molina and Baldetti have denied all charges brought against them.</p>

<p>Pérez Molina and Baldetti have faced a swath of legal challenges since their resignation. In April Aldana accused Pérez Molina of accepting part of a $25 million bribe while in office. In December Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/guatemala-ex-president-charged-in-corruption-scandal.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] by prosecutors, suspected of illicit association, customs fraud and bribery. Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-ex-president-detained-pending-corruption-investigation.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] pending investigation in September following an indictment over corruption charges. Also in September Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-resigns-under-corruption-allegations.php">sent</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://elperiodico.com.gt/2015/09/03/pais/la-carta-de-dimision-de-otto-perez-al-cargo-de-presidente-de-guatemala/">letter</a> [<em>El Periódico</em> materials, in Spanish] to both the Guatemalan congress and reporters announcing his resignation and his intention to "stand before justice." The day before his resignation, Pérez Molina was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/guatemala-president-stripped-of-immunity.php">stripped of his presidential immunity</a> [JURIST report] in a unanimous vote by congress. After Pérez Molina <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-president-refuses-to-resign-amid-corruption-allegations.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in August that he had no plans to resign, Guatemala's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/guatemala-supreme-court-approves-criminal-investigation-of-president.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] prosecutors' requests to impeach the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reinhold Hanning, a 94 year-old former Auschwitz guard, was convicted by a court in Detmold, German,y Friday and sentenced to five years in prison for his role in murder of 170,000 people. Hanning served as a guard at Auschwitz from 1942-1944. He joined the Hitler Youth as a young teenager and entered the SS at 18. The four-month trial heard testimony from Hanning, himself, and a number of Holocaust survivors. The defense for Hanning claimed the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4532712b1d244efa8995376963ec9967/verdict-coming-german-trial-former-auschwitz-guard">former SS sergeant</a> [AP report] never personally killed or beat any prisoners. Hanning admitted to serving at Auschwitz and said he was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/94-year-old-former-ss-sergeant-apologizes-to-nazi-victims-at-trial-in-germany.php">ashamed</a> [JURIST report]. He will remain free during any appeals process. Due to the age of many of those being tried, Hanning's case is likely to be one of the last trials heard in connection with the Holocaust. </p>

<p>German courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">2011 conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/auschwitz-paramedic-to-stand-trial-in-germany.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of a 95-year-old Auschwitz paramedic accused of being an accessory to the murder of 3,681 people at Auschwitz. The most recent person imprisoned for their role in the Holocaust was Oskar Groening. Known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">Groening was charged</a> [JURIST report] in September 2014 as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. In July Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he said he would <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel in the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/acc66959-2103-4ce3-9bf8-4ee9d9c60108/1/doc/15-985_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/acc66959-2103-4ce3-9bf8-4ee9d9c60108/1/hilite/">rejected the appeal</a> [ruling, PDF] of former Connecticut governor John Rowland's corruption charges on Friday. In its ruling, the court stated that "Rowland was properly convicted ... because he created or participated in the creation of documents that misrepresented&#8212;or "falsified"&#8212;his relationships with Congressional candidates, [Lisa] Wilson-Foley and Mark Greenberg." Rowland had arranged to provide political consulting work for the aforementioned candidates in contravention of current campaign finance law, particularly in receiving payments from outside sources, such as Wilson-Foley's husband's nursing home company, so as to "avoid reporting the payments to the Federal Election Commission." The court rejected arguments by Rowland's attorney that "principles of contract law prevent [the court] from concluding that documents styled as contracts are 'falsified' within the meaning of the statute" and that the government had failed to disclose statements by Wilson-Foley which could have potentially prejudiced Rowland. Rowland faces a potential two-and-a-half year prison term.</p>

<p>This would not be the first time Rowland has served a prison sentence for corruption charges. In 2004 he <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/breaking-news-former-ct-governor.php">pleaded guilty to corruption charges</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/former-connecticut-governor-rowland.php">served 10 months</a> [JURIST reports] of a one-year sentence. At that time, Rowland had admitted to receiving more than $100,000 in gifts from state contractors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Kenyan judge on Thursday upheld the use of anal examinations to determine the sexual orientation of an individual. Judge Mathew Emukule <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/kenya-upholds-use-of-anal-exam-to-determine-sexual-orientation">said</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] "I find no violation of human dignity, right to privacy and right to freedom of the petitioners." The case was initiated when two men suspected of engaging in a consensual, homosexual act, a crime in Kenya, were arrested and given anal examinations and HIV and hepatitis B tests, which they described as humiliating and amounting to torture. The ruling has raised concerns throughout the area, drawing the ire of Amnesty International Director for East Africa Muthoni Wanyeki, who <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/ruling-upholding-anal-tests-on-gay-men-in-kenya-unacceptable">called</a> [press release] "forcible anal examinations of men suspect of same-sex relationship ... abhorrent," and in violation of international laws against torture and ill-treatment, as well as to the basic right to privacy. The two men currently face up to 14 years in prison, if convicted.</p>

<p>Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals have gained increased rights globally in the last decade, but many still face discrimination and criminal punishment throughout the world. In July US President Barack Obama called on Kenya and other African countries to provide for the <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/obama-calls-for-improved-gay-rights-in-africa.php">equal treatment</a> [JURIST report] of LGBT individuals. In August JURIST Guest Columnists Anneke Meerkotter of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre and Graeme Reid of Human Rights Watch discussed how recent court rulings in Botswana, Kenya and Zambia illustrate <a href="/hotline/2015/08/meerkotter-reid-no-fault.php">significant progress</a> [JURIST op-ed] in human rights in general and in LGBT rights in particular. Homosexuality is currently outlawed in 34 African countries and is only explicitly legal in South Africa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, sentenced 11 people to life in prison Friday for the murder of 69 Muslims during religious riots in 2002. Over the course of the riots, which lasted for days, nearly 1,000 people were killed. A total of 24 people were convicted of the murders, which took place at a housing complex called the Gulbarg Society. Of the 24 convicted, 11 received <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/indian-court-sentences-11-to-life-in-prison-for-religious-riot-deaths-1466160257">life sentences</a> [WSJ report], 12 were sentenced to seven years, and one person was sentenced to 10 years. The prosecution asked for the death penalty, which the court rejected-finding that the massacre was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN0Z30O0">not planned</a> [Reuters report]. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the state's chief minister at the time. </p>

<p>Accusations that Modi did not do enough to stop the rioting continue to haunt him to this day, although the prime minister has so far denied any wrongdoing. As recently as September 2014, Modi was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/india-pm-facing-human-rights-suit-in-us.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] by the American Justice Center, on behalf of unnamed survivors of violence in India, who <a href="http://www.americanjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Modi_Summons__Complaint1.pdf">claimed</a> [complaint, PDF] that he failed to stop the riots. A judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-india-pm-over-2002-riots.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last year, agreeing with the US State Department that Modi is entitled to immunity from lawsuits in US courts. Modi was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/17/narendra-modi-india-election-hindu">elected</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] prime minister in May 2014 in a landslide victory. The election of the Hindu nationalist and 282 members of his conservative <a href="http://www.bjp.org/">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> [official website] was called historic, as no party has won by such a margin since 1984.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to a colleague familiar with the case, prominent Chinese civil rights lawyer Xia Lin was put on trial for fraud on Friday during a "far-reaching crackdown on political dissent." Xia had been detained in 2014 by Beijing police and later charged with Fraud. He is believed to have been defending human rights activist Guo Yushuan before this detainment. While not much is known at the moment, as journalists were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-trial-idUSKCN0Z310P">barred entry</a> [Reuters report] to the court, it is believed this case is the most recent in a string of attempts by President Xi Jinping's administration to crackdown on political opposition and activists. A research for Amnesty International in Hong Kong, William Nee, believes this case could set a precedent for how future cases on rights activists and lawyers will be handled. This news comes only a day after <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) issued a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/16/china-drop-cases-against-rights-lawyers">statement</a> [HRW report] asking Chinese authorities to drop cases against rights lawyers.</p>

<p>Xi's administration has been noted for increasing censorship of political opposition and rights groups. In April a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested and released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi in relation to the Panama Papers release. Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon announced in Aprilnthat his license to practice law was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] by the judicial bureau. Chinese lawyer and professor Chen Taihe <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">fled China</a> [JURIST report] in March and arrived in San Leandro, California, after he was detained last July as part of a crackdown on rights lawyers. The crackdown culminated in at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in February over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ethiopian security forces have killed more than 400 citizens since November, and arrested tens of thousands more, in hopes of squashing protest in the Oromia region, according to a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/06/15/such-brutal-crackdown/killings-and-arrests-response-ethiopias-oromo-protests">report</a> [HRW report] by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] Friday. The report calls the killings "the latest in a series of abuses against those who express real or perceived dissent in Oromia. It also discusses the Ethiopian government's attempts to restrict media freedom and access to information in Oromia. Most notably the government has restricted access to social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and also any "diaspora-run television stations," as these have been the most used means for dissemination of information. HRW called for the government to drop charges and release all those individuals detained as a result of their protesting, as well as a "credible, independent and transparent investigation into the use of excessive force by its security forces." The report also recommends the government address the violence used against protesters, eliminate restrictions to expression, remedy abuses to development programs, which have been used to displace certain families, and respectfully handle the detention of individuals. It also urges members of the international community to help coerce the Ethiopian government to take these concerns seriously and make changes.</p>

<p>In January several Ethiopian rights groups called on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ethiopia-rights-groups-urge-international-community-to-address-protester-deaths.php">international community to address the killing</a> [JURIST report] of protesters. In December HRW reported that activists had witnessed <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/18/ethiopia-lethal-force-against-protesters">security forces firing into throngs of protesters</a> [HRW report]. That report came a day after Ethiopian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13349400">Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/addis-ababa-master-plan-protests-hailemariam-desalegn-warns-merciless-action-will-be-used-1533790">warned</a> [IBT report] of "merciless legitimate action against any force bent on destabilising the area." Ethiopian officials have been claiming that the demonstrations are a front for those involved in the protests to insight violence and threaten the stability of the nation. Ethiopia has used its broad anti-terrorism laws to detain political opposition before. In October five Ethiopian bloggers were <a href="http://zone9ethio.blogspot.com/">acquitted of terrorism charges</a> [Zone9, in Amharic] relating to publications on their website. The publications, critical of the government, landed <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/ethiopian-zone-9-bloggers-acquitted.php">nine bloggers in jail</a> [JURIST report], and one charged in absentia, in April 2014 for violation of the laws. That same month UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16653&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] over the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-warns-of-counter-terrorism-measures-used-to-public-interest-groups.php">rising use of counter-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report] around the world. Many nations have used counter-terrorism as an excuse to restrict public assembly and stop the activities of public interest groups, Emmerson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau ordered Apple to stop sale of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Beijing due to claims by Chinese regulators that Apple Inc. violated a patent held by a Chinese company. According to Chinese media, the phones <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-regulator-orders-apple-to-stop-sales-of-two-iphone-models-1466166711">infringe on a Chinese patent</a> [WSJ report] for exterior design held by Shenzhen Baili for the 100C smartphone. A source associated with Apple's production plans says that Apple plans on ending production of the restricted models. Apple has stated that it plans to appeal the decision, but assuming that Apple fails, some believe that the ruling will create a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-17/apple-s-iphones-found-to-have-violated-chinese-rival-s-patent">harmful precedent</a> [Bloomberg report] for Apple throughout the entire country. All this comes at a time when Apple's shares have dropped significantly, largely thought to be a result of China's recent restrictions on the tech company.</p>

<p>Apple has been embroiled in controversy in China ever since it started operations in the country. In July 2013 New York-based labor rights group, <a href="http://chinalaborwatch.org/home.aspx">China Labor Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/labor-rights-group-accuses-apple-suppliers-of-violating-labor-laws.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Apple, and its affiliate <a href="http://pegatroncorp.com/">Pegatron</a> [corporate website], which assembles products including the iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, of withholding employees' pay and imposing excessive working hours at factories in mainland China. In December 2012 a Beijing court ordered Apple to pay damages of 1.03 million yuan (USD $165,908) to eight Chinese writers and two companies for copyright infringement. The <a href="http://bj2zy.chinacourt.org/">Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese], a regional court directly below China's appellate level courts, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/beijing-court-orders-apple-to-pay-copyright-infringement-damages.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that software available on Apple's app store contained unlicensed digital copies of the writers' books in violation of the plaintiffs' "right of communication through information networks." That decision was the second in four months from the same court ordering Apple to pay USD $83,000 in damages for alleged copyright infringement of a Chinese encyclopedia publisher. In July of the same year, the Guangdong Hich People's Court in China <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/apple-agrees-to-pay-china-company-60-million-for-ipad-trademark.php">confirmed a settlement</a> [JURIST report] reached the previous week in a trademark case whereby Apple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/business/global/apple-settles-an-ipad-trademark-dispute-in-china.html?_r=0">agreed to pay $60 million</a> [NYT report] to Shenzhen Proview Technology for the use of the iPad trademark in mainland China. Although Apple had already paid $55,000 for the trademark in 2009 to the company's Taiwanese affiliate, Proview Taipei, the Chinese affiliate argued that Apple misled it by buying the name through a smaller company, IP Application Development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three human rights experts of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/UNIIB/Pages/UNIIB.aspx">UN Independent Investigation on Burundi</a> (UNIIB) [official website] on Friday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20130&LangID=E">echoed previous calls for a stop to violence</a> [press release] after their second visit Burundi. There has been a considerable drop in the number of executions in Burundi following a warning issued by the UN rights chief. After noting this significant drop, one of the experts, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a> [official website], was emphatic that "this relative calm [in Burundi] should not be confused with long term stability." The experts drew attention to the continuing human rights violations,including politically-motivated detentions, disappearances, and torture, stating that "[f]or Burundi to move away from violence and conflict, it needs a truly inclusive political dialogue that will address the roots of the political crisis." While visiting Burundi, the members of the UNIIB were able to meet with national authorities, victims of human rights violations, and even visited Mpimba prison in Bujumbura. UNNIB was founded by the Human Rights Council in December 2015.</p>

<p>Violence in Burundi began in the wake of President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, to which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] in July. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed concern over increased violence and rights violations in Burundi and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-calls-for-inclusive-political-dialogue-to-end-burundi-crisis.php">called for an "inclusive political dialogue"</a> [JURIST report] to end the 11-year struggle. Speaking to the council about his trip to Burundi last month, the secretary-general stated, "I cannot stress enough the profound humanitarian consequences that political unrest, violence and impunity carry for the population." In January the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report stating that Burundian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-not-allowed-to-enter-burundi.php">barred entry</a> [JURIST report] into Burundi to independent rights experts dispatched by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate violations in the nation. Also in January Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-warns-against-increasing-violence-in-burundi.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of increasing violence in Burundi. In December the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution to dispatch experts to investigate human rights violations in Burundi, condemning violence in the country, use of excessive force by officials and restrictions on freedoms. In November the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-adopts-resolution-to-work-to-end-violence-in-burundi.php">unanimously adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution condemning the political violence and killings currently afflicting Burundi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN expert <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/MainaKiaibio.aspx">Maina Kiai</a> [UN profile], in presenting his <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session32/Documents/A_HRC_32_36_AUV.docx">report</a> [text, DOC] on religious, free market, political, and nationalist or cultural fundamentalism, said Friday that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. In advocating for a broader understanding of fundamentalism, one which includes any group that "advocate[s] strict and literal adherence to a set of basic beliefs or principles," and not just religious groups, Kiai stated that <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20132&LangID=E">"free market fundamentalism" is an "urgent threat"</a> [UN report]. He stated a "core purpose" of the rights of association and peaceful assembly "is to preserve people's ability to peacefully express their grievances with political leaders." He cited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China as two examples of states harming these rights through political fundamentalism. While acknowledging that this sort of freedom may challenge or even threaten a government regime, "it should not be confused with a threat to the State itself." Likewise, Kiai stated that economic fundamentalism can have drastic effects upon the ability to exercise the right to association or peaceful assembly. He hopes addressing these issues will quell the discontent festering within marginalized groups, often times leading to violent backlash.</p>

<p>In examining the merits of Kiai's report on fundamentalism's impact on the right to association and peaceful assembly, one need not look far. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">pleaded</a> [JURIST report] for the Myanmar Parliament to make changes to a proposed law which would significantly hamper the right to peaceful assembly. The UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights also recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-urges-release-of-detained-protesters-in-gambia.php">called for the release</a> [JURIST] of protesters detained by the Gambian government "for simply having exercised their rights to freedom of expression, opinion and assembly." The protesters in Gambia were "calling for free speech and an electoral forum."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law</a> [official website] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20127&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health, including reproductive and sexual health. The <a href="https:/-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/072/19/PDF/G1607219.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [report, PDF], presented Friday, refers to the "instrumentalization" of women in the healthcare system, in particular the "subjection of women's natural biological functions to a politicized patriarchal agenda." According to the report, women are viewed as vessels for children and their sexual functions are often looked down upon, as evidenced by the criminalization of termination of pregnancy and prostitution. Another harmful practice that the report addressed was the infringement upon the autonomy of women in receiving health services, especially in regards to sexual and reproductive health services, where moral or religious bias may lead to discrimination. The report also outlined discriminatory practices within the field of health, including genital mutilation, lack of access to medical information, higher levels of poverty, and overall access to healthcare institutions. The report called for remedial efforts by countries to provide "non-discriminatory enjoyment of the right to health...[that is] autonomous, effective and affordable."</p>

<p>Female access to equitable healthcare services has been a contentious and evolving battle throughout the world. Earlier this month independent experts for the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">found</a> [JURIST report] a woman faced "inhumane treatment" while seeking an abortion procedure in Northern Ireland. In the press release, the experts called upon countries to more effectively balance the rights of the fetus with the rights of the woman, viewing her as more than just a mechanism for child-bearing. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-elimination-of-female-genital-mutilation-by-2030.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all countries to eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 40 prosecutors in Virginia filed an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2UQU8E8K-Nkd3dVNDdrRWpaWHc/view">amicus brief</a> [text, PDF]  Friday in support of a challenge to the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-governor-restores-voting-rights-for-ex-felons.php">governor's executive action</a> [JURIST report] to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 felons individuals in the state. The prosecutors argue that the governor's actions are not only in violation of the Virginia constitution but also an issue of public safety. They are concerned that the restoration of felon voting rights will create an undue burden for them to discharge their duties. For instance, they argue that the current process of review burdens their resources by trying to identify felons in the jury selection process:<blockquote>If felons whose rights have been restored may not be struck for cause on the basis of their prior felony conviction, Commonwealth's Attorneys must use a peremptory strike to disqualify a felon deemed unfit for jury service. But each side generally only has four peremptory strikes in felony cases and three peremptory strikes in misdemeanor cases. ... Every peremptory strike is valuable because "the peremptory remains an important litigator's tool and a fundamental part of the process of selecting impartial juries," such that the "increasing limitation of it gives [one] pause." ... If Commonwealth's Attorneys are now required to use peremptory challenges to strike former felons, the peremptory challenge system may be significantly altered.</blockquote>The prosecutors also have an issue with how the executive order will affect the review process for felons who also want to have their gun rights restored. </p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In April a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a bill that will allow <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move comes after the EU <a href="http://avrupa.info.tr/resource-centre/eeas-news/eeas-single-view/article/eulex-kosovo-mandate-extended-budget-approved.html">voted</a> [press release] on Monday to extend and fully fund the mandate until 2018. The parliament had <a href="http://www.kuvendikosoves.org/?cid=1,128,8025">previous issues</a> [press release] about the mandate in regards to what types of cases the organization would prosecute and their relationships with local officials. As a result <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,4">Prime Minster Mustafa</a> [official website, Albanian] had to take to the assembly floor to alleviate negative attitudes about the program and fears of corruption. After much debate the measure was approved by 84-6 and adopted after a second review. </p>

<p>EULEX was established to aid Kosovo in the rule of law application when it comes to instances such as war crimes that may cause conflict with in the region. Two independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-kosovo-mission-should-be-held-accountable-for-lead-poisoning.php">called</a> [JURIST report] upon the UN in April to put into motion a plan to redress damages suffered by internationally displaced persons who were exposed to lead poisoning at camps settled by the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1998 and 1999. The head of the UN mission in Kosovo said in March that Kosovo is set to face "complex challenges" this year and should shift focus towards more <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-urges-kosovo-to-shift-focus-towards-rule-of-law.php">fundamental issues</a> [JURIST report] "such as the intrinsic links between post-conflict development, enforcement of the rule of law, and human rights," rather than politics. The Dutch government in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/kosovo-war-crimes-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the establishment of a special court being set up in The Hague to investigate and try alleged war crimes committed by ethnic Albanian rebels during and after Kosovo's 1998-99 guerilla war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Mexican Congress on Friday passed several anti-corruption bills that would increase the severity of penalties for corruption charges. Should <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> [official website, in Spanish] approve the bill, public officials would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-corruption-idUSKCN0Z4046">face</a> [Reuters report] increased fines and jail time for crimes such as bribery, embezzlement and illegal enrichment. While the bill would require government-funded entities to make public disclosures, <a href="http://pri.org.mx/JuntosHacemosMas/">Institutional Revolutionary Party</a> (IRP) [party website, in Spanish] members and allies voted down a provision requiring the same for public officials. Nieto is expected to sign the bill after recently declaring his intention to strengthen corruption laws. </p>

<p>The anti-corruption bills in Mexico follow recent news of courts combating corruption worldwide. Also Friday the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-connecticut-governor.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the appeal of former Connecticut governor John Rowland's corruption charges. Former Guatemalan president Otto Pérez Molina, former vice president Roxana Baldetti, and 70 other Guatemalan officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/former-guatemala-president-and-vp-facing-corruption-money-laundering-charges.php">face corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] for being involved in an embezzlement scheme. Earlier this month, South African President Jacob Zuma, along with the state prosecutor, <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/jacob-zuma-appeals-ruling-reinstating-corruption-charges.php">began an appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a ruling reinstating 783 corruption charges against him. Last month, Former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-argentinian-president-charged-for-manipulating-the-dollar-market.php">charged in federal court </a> [JURIST report] for manipulating the economy in order to resolve the country's low foreign reserves.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Cairo Criminal Court on Saturday upheld the death sentences of six defendants, including three journalists, charged with espionage for leaking state secrets to Qatar. While the defendants were originally <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced to death in May</a> [JURIST report], the Egyptian court was required to seek advice from Grand Mufti Shawqi Allam before finalizing its ruling. Though former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] and two of his aides were among the 11 defendants originally tried in the espionage case, they only <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/egypt-espionage-case-160618062408884.html">received</a> [Al Jazeera report] a 25-year jail sentence. Morsi has also received a 15-year jail sentence for a lesser crime and still faces the death penalty on other counts. The court ruling has been a topic of much contention, particularly for its judgment upon the three journalist defendants employed by <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a> [official website]. Defendant Ibrahim Helal, a former director of Al Jazeera's Arabic channel, called the trial a sham and accused the court of making a politically biased decision based on fabricated and loose evidence. Human rights groups have denounced the ruling and have criticized Egypt's ongoing crackdown on the freedom of press. Qatar has also criticized the ruling, warning that it may endanger foreign relations. The defendants will have a chance to appeal the espionage case to Egypt's Court of Cessation for further review. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt </a> [BBC profile] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Earlier this month, a Cairo appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-appeals-court-acquits-33-convicted-protesters.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] 33 protesters previously sentenced to two years in prison for being involved in a large public demonstration. Also this month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-court-begins-trial-for-journalist-union-leader-and-members.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of a journalist union leader as well as two board members who were charged with spreading false news and harboring wanted reporters. Last month more than 100 Egyptian demonstrators were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egyptian-courts-sentence-protesters-to-five-years-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] for peacefully assembling without a permit. Three UN rights experts recently <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-egypt-must-end-crackdown-on-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to end its oppressive response towards human rights advocates in the country. In early May an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/egypt-court-sentences-six-to-death-for-leaking-state-secrets-to-qatar.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six people, including three journalists, to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to Qatar. Last month Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned the five-year prison sentences of 35 Al-Azhar students, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/egypt-court-overturns-rioting-sentences-of-35-al-azhar-students.php">ordering a retrial </a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April three UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-egypt-crackdown-on-human-rights-defenders.php">urged Egypt to cease</a> [JURIST report] its ongoing crackdown on humans rights defenders and organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST report] The <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/">New York Senate</a> [official website] on Saturday passed a <a href="http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2015/S6305">bill</a> [S6305] to legalize fantasy sports amid national concerns that the activity qualifies as illegal gambling. The bill would <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/sports/new-york-state-lawmakers-vote-to-legalize-fantasy-sports.html?_r=0">require</a> [NYT report] frequent and highly-skilled players to sufficiently identify themselves online to prevent them from taking advantage of casual players. Fantasy sports sites would also be required to give 15.5 percent of their profits to an education fund managed by the state lottery. While <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about-attorney-general">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] has been an avid opponent of the fantasy sport industry, he allowed legislators to handle the matter and has remained neutral to the bill so far. Schneiderman, however, has expressed his intention to continue legal action against industry leaders <a href="https://www.draftkings.com/">DraftKings</a> and <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/">FanDuel</a> [official websites]. The bill now awaits approval from <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/about">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile] who has suggested support through modification propositions. </p>

<p>Many officials have stated that online fantasy sports may be an illegal form of gambling. In April the Tennessee Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/tennessee-ag-issues-opinion-against-fantasy-sports.php">issued an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that fantasy sports amounts to illegal gambling within the state. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin released an advisory opinion in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hawaii-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php">declaring</a> [JURIST report] that daily fantasy sports websites in which players pay to participate are considered gambling and are therefore illegal in the state. Also in January Texas Attorney General <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/texas-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] daily fantasy sports websites illegal within the state. Earlier that month the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/new-york-court-allows-daily-sports-fantasy-websites-to-continue-operating.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] FanDuel and Draftkings a stay allowing them to continue to operate within the state during their appeal. In August the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled against New Jersey, deciding 2-1 to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ban-on-sports-betting.php">uphold</a> [JURIST report] the federal ban on sports betting in all but four states. In December 2011 the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/doj-finds-online-non-sports-gambling-lawful.php">clarified its stance on online gambling</a> [JURIST report] in a memorandum opinion holding online non-sports related gambling that crosses state or international borders is not covered by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-75/pdf/STATUTE-75-Pg491.pdf">Wire Act of 1961</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062016zor_e2q3.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. The cases were <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-1030.htm">Shew v. Malloy</a>, concerning Connecticut's ban, and and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/15-8704.htm">Kampfer v. Cuomo</a> [dockets], dealing with New York's ban. The Supreme Court has not taken a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] case since the 2008 decision in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> and the 2010 follow-up decision in <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

<p>Also Monday the court granted <em>certiorari</em> in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1204.htm">Jennings v. Rodriguez</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/jennings_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will address three questions concerning immigrant detention under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1225">8 USC § 1225</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1226">§ 1226</a> [text]:<blockquote><ol><br />
	<li>Whether aliens seeking admission to the United States who are subject to mandatory detention under Section 1225(b) must be afforded bond hearings, with the possibility of release into the United States, if detention lasts six months.</li><br />
	<li>Whether criminal or terrorist aliens who are subject to mandatory detention under Section 1226(c) must be afforded bond hearings, with the possibility of release, if  detention lasts six months.</li><br />
	<li>Whether, in bond hearings for aliens detained for six months under Sections 1225(b), 1226(c), or 1226(a), the alien is entitled to release unless the government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is a flight risk or a danger to the  community; whether the length of the alien's detention must be weighed in favor of release; and whether new bond hearings must be afforded automatically every six months.</li><br />
</ol></blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1251.htm">National Labor Relations Board v. SW General, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Supreme-Court-Petition-for-Certiorari.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will rule on presidential appointments. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345">Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998</a> (FVRA) provides for someone to fill a vacant role in an acting capacity. Section 3345(b) provides as a general rule that "[n]othwithstanding subsection (a)(1)," a person who is nominated to fill a vacant office that is  subject to the FVRA may not perform the office's functions and duties in an acting capacity unless the person served as first assistant to the vacant office for at least 90 days in the year preceding the vacancy. The question presented is whether the precondition in 5 USC § 3345(b)(1) on service in an acting capacity by a person nominated by the President to fill the office on a permanent basis applies only to first assistants who take office under Subsection (a)(1) of  5 USC § 3345, or whether it also limits acting service by officials who assume acting responsibilities under Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3). </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-6166_o7jp.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-1 Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/taylor-v-united-states/">Taylor v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-131000-hobbs-act-18-usc-1951">Hobbs Act</a> [DOJ backgrounder] applies to a drug robbery. The Hobbs Act makes it a crime for a person to affect commerce, or to attempt  to do so, by robbery. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the court found that because Congress has the power to regulate the market for marijuana under the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-adds-13-cases-to-2015-docket.php">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], Congress may also regulate drug theft. "By targeting a drug dealer in this way, a robber necessarily affects or attempts to affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction." Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion. He would "hold that the Act punishes a robbery only when the Government proves that the robbery itself affected interstate commerce."</p>

<p>Petitioner David Taylor was gang member who broke into the home of a drug dealer and stole marijuana, drug proceeds and a cell phone. He was prosecuted under the Hobbs Act and was eventually convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-adds-13-cases-to-2015-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in the case in October and <a href="act.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-138_5866.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 4-3 Monday in  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rjr-nabisco-inc-v-the-european-community/">RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. The European Community</a>  [SCOTUSblog materials] for <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a> [corporate website] in a challenge by EU countries accusing the company of a money laundering scheme. The court found that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO) [text] does not apply extraterritorially. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the court, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring in part but dissenting from the judgment, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Breyer also filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting from the judgment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the case.</p>

<p>The European Community (EC) and 26 of its member states brought this suit claiming that Russian and Colombian organized crime rings smuggled drugs into Europe, then laundered the profits into a scheme that included the sale of RJR Nabisco cigarettes. RJR executives allegedly bribed border agents in South America and wired the cigarette payments into accounts in the US. The EC suffered injury in this scheme in the form of lost tax revenue and lost profits from state-owned tobacco businesses. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15-138-op-below-CORRECT.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court's decision to dismiss the suit. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-adds-13-cases-to-2015-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human rights abuses against the Rohingya in Myanmar may amount to crimes against humanity, according to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session32/Documents/A_HRC_32_18_AUV.docx">report</a> [text, DOC] released Monday by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website]. The report <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/rohingya-victims-crimes-humanity-160620131906370.html">documents</a> [Al Jazeera report] abuses against minorities that include "arbitrary deprivation of nationality, severe restriction on freedom of movement, threats to life and security, denial of rights to health and education, forced labour, sexual violence, and limitations to ... political rights, among other violations". The report <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20137&LangID=E">states</a> [press release] that the Rohingya and Kaman Muslims continue to live in camps for internally displaced people after approximately four years since violence began in the Rakhine State. Muslims in the Rakhine State are severely restricted from accessing basic healthcare, emergency medical treatment and education. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54268#.V2iKslepouk">urged</a> [UN News Centre report] the government of Myanmar to take "concrete steps to put an end to the systemic discrimination and ongoing human rights violations against minorities".</p>

<p>Human rights has been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. Last week a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-expert-fundamentalism-harming-rights-to-assembly-and-association.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] a report on religious, free market, political, and nationalist or cultural fundamentalism, stating that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. Early this month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries; the government of Myanmar alone <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military in March as part of a UN join action plan made in 2012. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that they say has the advocacy organization says has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly. Also in May US Secretary of State John Kerry offered support to Myanmar's newly democratic government and <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/kerry-urges-myanmar-to-promote-further-human-rights-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the country to push more democratic reform and address human rights issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-415_mlho.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/encino-motorcars-llc-v-navarro/">Encino Motorcars v. Navarro</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that it could not rely on the Department of Labor's (DOL) interpretation of a statute on overtime pay, sending the case back to the lower court. The issue in the case was whether "service advisors" at car dealerships are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's (FLSA) overtime-pay requirements. The DOL had originally <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/argument-preview-justices-to-consider-whether-a-car-dealers-service-advisor-is-a-salesman-exempt-from-overtime-rules-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act/">concluded</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that service advisors were entitled overtime pay, but reversed its decision following numerous courts' rejection of the regulation. Then the DOL updated the regulation back to its original stance excluding service advisors from the statute. The plaintiff employee, Hector Navarro, filed suit against his automobile dealership employer alleging that the latter violated the FLSA when it did not pay him overtime compensation. Navarro <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/04/argument-analysis-justices-dubious-about-exempting-car-dealership-service-advisors-from-overtime-rules/">argued</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that the justices should rely on the updated DOL regulation, but the court stated that "one basic procedural requirement of administrative rulemaking is that an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions." The court <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/06/20/supreme-court-rules-against-administration-on-overtime-for-rj-reynolds-on-rico/#367ecce7a7c4">concluded</a> [Forbes report] that the update to the FLSA was "issued without the reasoned explanation that was required in light of the [DOL's] change in position," that the industry relied upon the DOL's position since 1978 that service advisors were exempt from overtime pay requirements, and that the updated rule could not carry the force of law. The Supreme Court vacated and <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/284108-justices-labor-dept-must-explain-change-in-overtime-pay-rules">remanded</a> [<em>The Hill</em> report] the case to the Ninth Circuit for further review in a 6-2 opinion. </p>

<p>This case is decided on the heels of a DOL decision to update its FLSA overtime rules. Since 1938, the FLSA <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-new-overtime-law-means-for-everyone-2016-5">directed</a> [Business Insider report] that employees must be paid at least time-and-a-half for each hour they worked more than 40 hours a week. Workers that received less than $23,660 a year or $455 a week were to be paid overtime with some exceptions. Last month the White House <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-extends-overtime-pay-to-42-million-salaried-workers-2016-5">announced</a> [Business Insider report] that the DOL would raise the salary threshold for overtime pay to $47,476 a year or $913 a week. The change has widespread <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2016/05/04/overtime-rule-changes-are-coming-is-your-business-ready/#6da09f095f56">consequences</a> [Forbes report] for businesses and nonprofits who must either raise the wages for employees or pay overtime compensation. The Obama administration has <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/final2016/">maintained</a> [DOL official site] that the new rule will improve the lives of workers while businesses and Republicans have <a href="https://www.shrm.org/legalissues/federalresources/pages/overtime-rule-bill-introduced.aspx">criticized</a> [SHRM report] the rule stating that it will "hurt the lowest paid American workers the most".</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-446_ihdk.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] several provisions of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/bills-112hr1249enr.pdf">Leahy-Smith America Invents Act</a> (AIA) [text, PDF] on Monday. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/cuozzo-speed-technologies-llc-v-lee/">Cuozzo Speed Technologies v. Lee</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] the court heard arguments on whether the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decisions in challenges are under judicial review and whether the Board may construe claims in a challenged patent to their broadest reasonable interpretation rather than its plain and ordinary meaning. In a unanimous decision the court upheld the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cuozzo-op-below.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] in favor of the US Patent and Trademark Office.</p>

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-attorneys-fees-patent-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-justices-validate-pto-rules-for-inter-partes-review/">Under the AIA statute</a> [SCOTUSBlog analysis], competitors can file a petition seeking inter partes review. The newly created Patent Trial and Appeal Board can institute a review if it finds a "reasonable likelihood that the challenger would prevail." The point of contention is the language that the review decision is "final and nonappealable." When issuing a patent, the PTO considers applications under a "broadest reasonable interpretation" standard to determine if the patent conflict with prior art. However, in litigation, an "ordinary meaning" standard has been applied. Under the AIA, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has used the broadest reasonable interpretation standard which is the major point of dispute in the case. Due to this conflict and confusion, Global Positioning System (GPS) manufacturer <a href="http://www.garmin.com/en-US">Garmin</a> [official website] requested the PTO review Cuozzo's trademark on speed indicator technology, alleging that multiple parts were ambiguous. Cuozzo requested to revise those portions, but instead the PTO found that no changes should be made.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/utah-v-strieff/">Utah v. Strieff</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that evidence seized incident to a lawful arrest on an outstanding warrant is not excluded because that warrant was discovered during an unlawful stop. The court, in a 5-3 decision, reversed the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-20120854.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="https://www.utcourts.gov/courts/sup/">Utah Supreme Court</a> [official website], which found that the exclusionary rule applied. The ruling ultimately does not overrule <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/371/471/case.html">Wong Sun v. United States</a>, but merely applies the <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/422/590/case.html">Brown factors</a> [Justia materials] and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-the-exclusionary-rule-is-weakened-but-it-still-lives/">determines</a> [SCOTUSblog analysis] that suppression is unwarranted in this matter. In applying the <span class="casename">Brown</span> factors the majority concluded that the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/constitutions/United_States_of_America_1992.php#amendment_iv">constitutional violation</a> [Fourth Amendment text] was "at most negligent" and in "good faith" therefore preventing suppression. Justice Sonia Sotomayer filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in part. Sotomayor wrote, "[d]o not be soothed by the opinion's technical language: This case allows the police to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and check it for  outstanding traffic war­rants&#8212;even if you are doing nothing wrong." Justice Elena Kagan also filed a dissent, joined by Ginsburg.</p>

<p>In this case the police received an anonymous tip that narcotics were being sold in a house, and the house was put under surveillance for suspicious activity. During the surveillance, a detective stopped Edward Strieff while he was exiting the house to ask some questions. The detective asked for ID and ran a warrant check, which returned a "small traffic warrant." The detective arrested Strieff and found drug paraphernalia incident to the arrest. Strieff has argued that the initial stop was illegal since the detective did not have reasonable suspicion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/"> International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2016_04476.PDF">sentenced</a> [decision, PDF; <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=PR1223">press release</a>] ex-Congolese military leader Jean-Pierre Bemba to 18 years in jail for crimes against humanity and war crimes stemming from his involvement in the conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2002 and 2003. Bemba was sentenced to 16 years for murder as a crime against humanity; 16 years for murder as a war crime; 18 years for rape as a war crime; 18 years for rape as a crime against humanity; and 16 years for pillaging as a war crime, with all sentences to run concurrently. The court noted that the rape was particularly disturbing as it was "(i) against particularly defenceless victims and (ii) with particular cruelty." It is possible that Bemba will appeal the sentence.</p>

<p>The <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Bemba&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Bemba</a> [JURIST news archive] case has been ongoing before the ICC since 2008. In March the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/jurist-the-case-of-the.php">found unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that Bemba was guilty of two counts of crimes against humanity and three counts of war crimes for his role in the armed conflict in the CAR in 2002 and 2003. In September Bemba <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-congo-vp-pleads-not-guilty-to-interfering-with-administrati.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to charges of interfering with the administration of justice after he and four members of his legal team were <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/former-congolese-vice-president-ordered-to-stand-trial-on-charges-of-interfering-with-justice.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST reports] on those charges. In October 2014 ICC Trial Chamber III <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/icc-delays-closing-arguments-in-bemba-case-to-hear-prosecution-witness.php">delayed the closing statements</a> [JURIST report] in the case against Bemba so that it could hear additional witness testimony after the defense requested to testify about alleged collusion between prosecution witnesses. In November 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/icc-announces-arrests-for-falsifying-evidence-in-congo-rebel-leaders-war-crimes-trial.php">four persons were arrested on charges of falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the trial of Jean-Pierre Bemba Bemba's defense lawyers opened their case before the ICC in August 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court in Cairo on Tuesday invalidated the Egyptian president's decision to give sovereignty over two islands to Saudi Arabia. In April <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] transferred sovereignty of Tiran and Sanafir islands in the Red Sea to Saudi Arabian <a href="http://www.saudiembassy.net/about/Biographies-of-Ministers.aspx">Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman</a> [official profile] as a gesture of good will following a meeting in which deals for oil and development had been discussed. While some showed celebration within the court room, it is likely that the government will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/21/egyptian-court-quashes-transfer-red-sea-islands-saudi-arabia">appeal</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the ruling.</p>

<p>Last year Egypt and Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-saudi-arabia-sign-joint-security-agreement.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to improve stability and safety in the region. The agreement, entitled the "Cairo Declaration" and signed in Cairo by al-Sisi and Saudi Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to boost military and social ties in the region, as well as improve economic stability. The relationship between the two countries has been improving since the ouster Islamist Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Saudi Arabia has in turn offered billions of dollars to aid Egypt in its joint bombing campaign with the Saudis against Yemen. The pact also sets out plans to build a new joint Arab military force to combat regional terrorism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/EN/Homepage/home_node.html">Germany's top court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/EN/2016/bvg16-034.html;jsessionid=CC63302319B204320BF462589C4D36E9.2_cid392">ruled</a> [press release] Tuesday that a bond-buy program created by the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) [official website] complies with German law. The unlimited bond-buying program was created at the height of Europe's debt crisis. The program, called <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html">Outright Monetary Transaction</a> [ECB profile], was created in September 2012 in order to save the Euro. The program itself has never been used. Many against the program complain that the ECB has overstepped its authority and is taking advantage of the system. However, the Federal Constitution Court ultimately decided that the program "doesn't present a constitutionally relevant threat the German Parliament's right to decide on the budget." This is not the first time the German court has had to deal with this issue. In February 2014 the Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/germany-court-removes-case-against-bond-buying-plan-to-european-court.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] this same case to the European Court of Justice.</p>

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing struggle to establish financial stability in the EU. In January 2015 EU Advocate General Cruz Villalon <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/eu-legal-advisor-supports-ecbs-bond-purchase-plan.php">gave legal support</a> [JURIST report] to the ECB program as an attempt to remedy the financial crisis in the Eurozone. In September 2014 the EU parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-parliament-approves-new-bank-supervisory-mechanism.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new bank supervisory mechanism. Last November the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports]. That June the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-proposes-regulations-to-address-future-financial-crises.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a proposal that would address the problems of bailing out large banks with public funds during financial crises in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/bogalusa-splc-filing-debtorsprison.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] is accusing a Louisiana judge of running a modern-day debtors' prison. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> [advocacy website], alleges that Judge Robert Black is sending poor defendants to jail when they cannot pay fines and charging them an "extension fee" to avoid jail time. The lawsuit contents that the judge routinely jails people who cannot pay fines for minor offenses without verifying why they cannot pay. One <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawsuit-alleges-louisiana-judge-runs-debtors-prison-40017957">example</a> [AP report] given is of a man who was fined $450 for stealing $5 worth of groceries and then jailed for four hours when he could not pay the fine or extension fee until a cousin paid the fee. Beyond just jailing the poor, the lawsuit contends that the extension fee created by Black to allow defendants to buy additional time in order to pay their fines is illegal and not authorized by state law. The lawsuit is seeking a declaration condemning Black and the Bogalusa City Court for their actions and an injunction against their practices.</p>

<p>The treatment of <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] has been a matter of ongoing concern in the US. In March the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">urged</a> state court systems to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants. In February the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/california-supreme-court-rules-governor-can-move-forward-with-prison-overcrowding-ballot-measure.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Jerry Brown can put his plan to ease prison overcrowding on the ballot this November. In January the US Supreme Court ruled that a landmark decision banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles should <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. In August the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/doj-reaches-settlement-with-la-prisons-on-mentally-ill-inmate-care.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Los Angeles prisons on mentally ill inmate care. In May of last year Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-us-prisons-using-excessive-force-on-mentally-disabled-prisoners.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that mentally disabled prisoners experience "unnecessary, excessive, and even malicious force" at the hands of prison staff across the US. A federal court in February 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arizona-reaches-settlement-in-prisoner-healthcare-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the Arizona Department of Corrections and the American Civil Liberties Union in a class action lawsuit over the health care system within Arizona prisons. Also last February rights group Equal Justice Under Law <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/missouri-towns-sued-over-debtors-prisons.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the cities of Ferguson and Jennings, Missouri, for their practice of jailing citizens who fail to pay debts owed to the city for minor offenses and traffic tickets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law makes major changes to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-toxic-substances-control-act">Toxic Substance Control Act</a> (TSCA) [EPA backgrounder], which has not been modified since it was passed in 1976. The law provides the EPA a new risk-based safety standard to evaluate chemicals. The new standard places significant weight on vulnerable individuals such as children and pregnant women. Some environmental groups say the new law does not grant the EPA enough power, while others argue it gives federal regulators excessive power over the states. </p>

<p>The Obama administration has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/obama-administration-presses-congress.php">calling</a> [JURIST report] for Congress to enact legislation to tighten chemical and toxin regulations since 2009. The administration argued that reform was needed because many of the chemicals in the TSCA were no longer used or produced, while other toxins were increasingly showing up in people's bodies that in 1976 were not considered dangerous. Led by the Obama administration's Essential Principles for Reform of Chemicals Management Legislation, US Senators Barbara Boxer and Frank Lautenberg as well as Representatives Henry Waxman and Bobby Rush crafted the legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN human rights adviser <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54294#.V2s4S2PG7ow">called</a> [UN News Centre report] on Bahrain Wednesday to ensure human rights are respected following protests triggered by the decision to strip Sheikh Issa Qassem, a prominent Shia religious leader, of his nationality. The protesters were also urged to exercise their rights peacefully and avoid violence. UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/adviser.shtml">Adama Dieng</a> [official website], warned the government that repression will not eliminate grievances, only increase them.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.wyd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of Wyoming</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wyd.uscourts.gov/pdfforms/orders/15-cv-043-S%20Order.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] Tuesday that the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) "lacked Congressional authority to promulgate" regulations concerning fracking on federal and Indian lands. The court came to this conclusion by applying the test, as formulated in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765&q=Chevron+U.S.A.+Inc.+v.+Natural+Res.+Def.+Council,+Inc.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39&as_vis=1">Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</a> [opinion], which asks whether Congress has "directly spoken to the precise question at issue." Upon a negative answer "a reviewing court must respect the agency's construction of the statute so long as it is permissible." In this case, the court found that the BLM's attempt to regulate fracking was "in excess of its statutory authority and contrary to law." It is expected that the government will appeal the ruling.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">Fracking</a> [JURIST backgrounder], or hydraulic fracturing, is a controversial method of tapping natural gas deposits with highly pressurized fluids. The method, commonly used in Marcellus Shale deposits, has raised environmental and public health concerns. In October the same judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-judge-halts-enforcement-of-blm-fracking-regulations.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting the Department of the Interior and the BLM from enforcing regulations applying to fracking. US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/obama-administration-publishes-federal-fracking-regulations.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the publication of the rules at issue in this case in March of last year. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/new-york-puts-fracking-ban-in-place.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] fracking in the state last June. In March of last year the Maryland House of Delegates <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/maryland-lawmakers-approve-3-year-fracking-moratorium.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to place a three-year moratorium on fracking in the state. In January 2015 Scotland <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a moratorium on the granting of permits for unconventional oil and gas extraction, including fracking amid environmental and health concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/miss%20marriage%20order.pdf">declined to block</a> [order, PDF] Mississippi's <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2016/html/HB/1500-1599/HB1523SG.htm">HB 1523</a> [text], which would allow clerks to refuse marriage licenses to same-sex couples citing "sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction." The law, set to take effect July 1, recognizes and protects three beliefs: that "(a) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman; (b)  Sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and (c)  Male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth." While some contend the ruling is a "reasonable accommodation" to religious beliefs, others believe it is legalized discrimination. The judge is set to hear arguments in related challenges later this week.</p>

<p>Mississippi's governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/mississippi-governor-signs-religious-freedom-bill-into-law.php">signed this bill into law</a> in April, just days after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners. In November the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/mississippi-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-divorce.php">same-sex divorce is legal</a> [JURIST report] within the state. In a 5-4 decision, the high court granted the divorce order citing to the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [JURIST report] as the main legal authority. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-981_4g15.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 4-3 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fisher-v-university-of-texas-at-austin-2/">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that the university's race-conscious admissions program is lawful. Abigail Fisher brought suit against the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), alleging that its race-conscious admission program violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the Fourteenth Amendment. Fisher was denied admission to UT Austin under their holistic review program, which reviews applicants based on, among many other factors, special circumstances such as socioeconomic background and race. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the majority, upholding the admissions policy that was in place at the time, but noting that the university should continue to review its practices:<blockquote>The Court's affirmance of the University's admissions policy today does not necessarily mean the University may rely on that same policy without refinement. It is the University&#8217;s ongoing obligation to engage in constant  deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Samuel Alito also filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and by Thomas. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.</p>

<p>This is the second time this case has reached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-rules-in-affirmative-action-case.php">remanded the case</a> [JURIST report] to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 2013 after finding that the court did not hold UT to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5183084208914209139&amp;q=grutter+v.+bollinger&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/forum/symposium-aa/index-printer.php">symposium</a>] and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4987623155291151023&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</a> [opinion]. On remand, the Fifth Circuit found that UT's <a href="/feature/featured/state-bans-on-affirmative-action/">affirmative action</a> [JURIST backgrounder] policy was narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of diversity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">split 4-4</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-texas/">United States v. Texas</a> [SCOTUSblog materials], allowing an order blocking enforcement of the Obama administration's immigration police to remain in place. The per curiam opinion read simply, "The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court." The question before the court was whether a state that provides subsidies to undocumented immigrants has standing to challenge the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] regarding its guidance seeking to establish a process for considering deferred action for more undocumented immigrants. Under the Obama administration, DHS has long utilized a system of "deferred action," meaning it does not pursue deportation for certain illegal immigrants on a discretionary basis. In 2014 <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/secretary">Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson</a> [official profile] issued guidance seeking a deferred action protocol be established for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for five years and either came here as children or currently have children who are US citizens or permanent residents. Twenty-six states <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/two-states-join-texas-immigration-lawsuit.php">joined a suit</a> [JURIST report] by Texas to challenge this guidance, arguing that the policy will create more immigrants with a deferred action status, and states must sustain a financial burden to maintain these individuals in their state systems. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-blocks-obamas-executive-action-on-immigration.php">blocked the policy</a> [JURIST report] last year.</p>

<p>Also Thursday, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/13-1496_7648.pdf">split 4-4</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/dollar-general-corporation-v-mississippi-band-of-choctaw-indians/">Dollar General Corporation v. Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians</a> [SCOTUSblog materials]. The issue was whether tribal courts can hear civil cases involving non-Indian businesses that have contractual agreements with the tribe. The case involves a sexual harassment claim brought in a tribal court by an Indian intern against the manager of a Dollar General store leasing property from and taking part in an internship program paid for by the tribe. While Indian courts do not generally have jurisdiction over non-Indian persons or corporations, at issue is language from an earlier Supreme Court decision in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html">Montana v. United States</a> [opinion] that a "tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members." Thursday's split allows a lower court ruling, which had found jurisdiction, to stand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.baltimorepolice.org">Baltimore Police</a> [official website] Officer Caesar Goodson, Jr. was <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/2895425/Document-Verdict-in-the-trial-of-Officer-Caesar.pdf">acquitted</a> [transcript, PDF] Thursday of all charges in relation to the 2015 death of Freddie Gray. The case was presided over by Baltimore Circuit Associate Judge Barry Williams, who stated that "in order for there to be a conviction, the state must show, not that the defendant failed to do an act required by the duties of his office, but that the defendant corruptly failed to do an act required by the duties of his office." Williams went on to conclude that the evidence presented against Goodson did not indicate inherently criminal conduct. Goodson, the police van driver who was accused of having given MGray a "rough ride," had been charged with second-degree depraved heart murder, three counts of manslaughter, second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. Goodson is one of six officers <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/baltimore-police-officer-acquitted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] last year. The trial of police officer William Porter ended in a hung jury and mistrial in December, and Edward Nero was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/baltimore-police-officer-acquitted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] last month. </p>

<p>Gray's arrest and death in April of last year led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In September Baltimore reached a tentative agreement with Gray's family to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-reaches-tentative-64-million-settlement-in-freddie-gray-case.php">pay $6.4 million in settlement</a> [JURIST report]. In April of last year Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">urged Baltimore police to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://courts.arkansas.gov/courts/supreme-court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://opinions.aoc.arkansas.gov/WebLink8/0/doc/355479/Electronic.aspx">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a state law Thursday that allows for the type, manufacturers and sellers of drugs used for lethal injections to be kept confidential. This ruling would allow the execution of eight death row inmates if the stays on their execution dates can be lifted before one of the drugs in the three-drug protocol expires on June 30. A group of the death row inmates had argued that the drug secrecy laws had the potential to lead to cruel and unusual punishment and that the state had failed to keep their pledge to share that information.      </p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide.

A few days before that a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/miami-judge-florida-death-penalty-law-unconstitutional.php">Miami judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's revamped death penalty law is unconstitutional because it does not require a unanimous agreement among jurors to approve executions. In April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">Virginia's General Assembly voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1468_8n59.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-1 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/birchfield-v-north-dakota/">Birchfield v. North Dakota</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that governments can require suspected drunk drivers to undergo breath tests without first obtaining a warrant, but cannot require them to take a more invasive blood test. The case came to the Supreme Court through three unrelated cases in Minnesota and North Dakota. In the Minnesota case, William Bernard was charged with refusing a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) breath test. However, his charges were dismissed by the state's district court, which concluded that the warrantless breath test was not permitted under the Fourth Amendment. That ruling was affirmed by the Minnesota Supreme Court. In the North Dakota case, Danny Birchfield and Steve Beylund were arrested and charged for refusing to submit to a BAC blood test. Their charges were upheld by that state's district courts, which rejected both Birchfield's argument that the Fourth Amendment prohibited criminalizing his refusal to submit to a blood test and Beylund's argument that his consent to a blood test was coerced by an officer's warning. These rulings were affirmed by the North Dakota Supreme Court. The US Supreme Court reversed the rulings of both the states' highest courts in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito:<blockquote>There is no indication in the record or briefing that a breath test would have failed to satisfy the State's interests in acquir­ing evidence to enforce its drunk-driving laws against Birchfield. ... Unable  to  see  any  other  basis  on which to justify a warrantless test of Birchfield's blood, we conclude that Birchfield was threatened with an unlawful search. ... Bernard, on the other hand, was criminally prosecuted for refusing a warrantless breath test. That test was a permissible search incident to Bernard's arrest for drunk driving. The Fourth Amendment did not re­quire officers to obtain a warrant prior to demanding the test, and Bernard had no right to refuse it.</blockquote>The court remanded Beylund's case to the state court to reevaluate consent given the partial inaccuracy of the officer's ruling&#8212;i.e. the erroneous advice that the state could permissibly compel both blood and breath BAC tests. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a concurring opinion, while Justice Clarence Thomas concurred in part in the judgment and dissented in part. </p>

<p>This opinion is part of a series of decisions being decided by the Supreme Court as it nears the last day of its current term.  Many other groundbreaking decisions have been released by the Supreme Court in the last week including another Fourth Amendment case, <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-allows-use-of-evidence-after-unlawful-stop.php">Utah v. Strieff</a>, that included a scathing dissent from Sotomayor and a decision on a <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-race-conscious-college-admissions-program.php">race-conscious college admissions program</a> [JURIST reports] at the University of Texas. More opinions are expected to be released on Monday. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-6092_1an2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 Thursday in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mathis-v-united-states/">Mathis v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a prior crime can be used for imposing enhanced federal sentences in a new conviction under the <a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41449.pdf">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> [materials] (ACCA), "but only if its elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense." The court also held that there is no exception to this rule "when a defendant is convicted under a statute that lists multiple, alternative means of satisfying one (or more) of its elements." In other words, the court stated that courts must ask "whether the crime of conviction is the same as, or narrower than, the relevant generic offense" and not whether the defendant's "means of committing the crime falls within the generic definition." This particular case involved the Iowa burglary statute under which Richard Mathis was convicted as a felon being in possession of a firearm. The statute in question covered a broader range of conduct than that covered by generic burglary and set out alternative ways of satisfying the locational elements of the crime. Nevertheless, a federal district court imposed an ACCA sentence enhancement, and the US Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit affirmed. In the absence of an enhanced federal sentence, a defendant convicted for being in possession of a firearm following three prior convictions for a violent felony gets a 10-year maximum penalty. However, with the ACCA's enhanced sentence, there is a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.  The prior convictions for the said violent felony can be under either federal or state statutes. Recognizing that the court has repeatedly made clear for more than 25 years that application of ACCA involves, "and involves only, comparing elements," the Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit's decision in an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan. </p>

<p>Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion, while Justices Steven Breyer and Samuel Alito dissented. This opinion is part of a series of decisions being decided by the Supreme Court as it nears the last day of its current term. Also Thursday the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1468_8n59.pdf">Birchfield v. North Dakota</a> [opinion, PDF] that governments can require drunk drivers to undergo breath tests without first obtaining a warrant, but cannot require them to take a more invasive blood test. Many other groundbreaking decisions have been released by the Supreme Court in the last week including another Fourth Amendment case, <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-allows-use-of-evidence-after-unlawful-stop.php">Utah v. Strieff</a>, that included a scathing dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor and a decision on a <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-race-conscious-college-admissions-program.php">race-conscious college admissions program</a> at the University of Texas [JURIST reports]. More opinions are expected to be released on Monday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China continues to harvest organs of prisoners: report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China continues to harvest organs from prisoners and those opposed to the Chinese Communist Party, according to a <a href="http://endorganpillaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Bloody_Harvest-The_Slaughter-June-23-V2.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF] released on Wednesday. The report, by David Kilgour, David Matas and Ethan Gutman, relies upon statements and publicly available records in coming to its conclusion, including interviews with doctors claiming to have performed thousands of transplants throughout their careers. While the Chinese government contends that around 10,000 legal transplants occur per year, the report estimates that anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 organ transplants occur in Chinese hospitals. The authors claim that more than 10,000 organ transplants are attributable to China's several largest hospitals alone. According to the report, the discrepancy in the numbers is the result of China's attempts to cover up the execution and organ harvesting of prisoners, many of which are imprisoned based upon their religious or political beliefs. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that "such stories about forced organ harvesting in China are imaginary and baseless&#8212;they don't have any factual foundation." If true, the report would implicate severe human rights violations by the Chinese government, which claims to rely almost entirely on a voluntary donation system since it <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-house-panel-questions-china-organ-transplants-from-executed-inmates.php">faced heightened scrutiny</a> [JURIST report] in recent years for the practice of harvesting organs from political dissidents.</p>

<p>In 2009, it was reported that <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/two-thirds-of-china-organ-transplants.php">65 percent of China's organ donations</a> [JURIST report] came from executed prisoners. China pledged in 2007 at a <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/10home/index.html">World Medical Association</a> [profession website] meeting to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/china-restricts-human-organ-transplants.php">end the practice</a> [JURIST report] of harvesting prisoners' organs, except for donations to relatives. This decision came after criticism by the <a href="http://www.bts.org.uk/">British Transplantation Society</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/china-dismisses-reports-of-harvested.php">accused China</a> [JURIST report] of selling organs harvested from executed prisoners. China <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/china-denies-rampant-black-market-for.php">denied these and other allegations</a> [JURIST report], saying that all donors must give consent before their organs are used.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/">Parliament of Sri Lanka</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/en/news-en/view/1208/?category=6">passed</a> [press release] the <a href="http://srilankabrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sri-Lanka-RTI-bill-full-report.pdf">"Right to Information" Bill</a> [bill, PDF] Friday. The bill, introduced in March, was passed to encourage the public to combat corruption and hold its government accountable. The Act contains provisions on the right to access information, when that right may be denied, the establishment of a commission on the matter, and the appointment of leaders to oversee it. Citizens will have the right to access public information from government, public and local entities. Citizens will even be able to access data from organizations substantially funded by the government and institutions of higher education.  Exceptions to the law include: medical records, trade secrets, defense interests, and information that may be in contempt of court, etc. </p>

<p>The global commnity has been calling on the Sri Lankan government to create more accountability, most recently since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war.The UN released a report in September finding that <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-war-crimes-may-have-been-committed-during-sri-lanka-civil-war.php">war crimes may have been committed</a> [JURIST report] during the war. Later that month the President of Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/sri-lanka-pm-rejects-un-call-for-international-war-crimes-investigation.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a UN recommendation for international involvement in its domestic investigation of the war crimes. The UN report came amid mounting pressure on the Sri Lankan government from human rights groups and the international community to investigate and prosecute abuses during the conflict with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/separatist-terrorism/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. In 2014 then-US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Stephen Rapp called on Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/us-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">investigate rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by security forces during the civil war. In 2013 UK Prime Minister David Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/britain-pm-demands-independent-sri-lanka-rights-investigation.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the Sri Lankan government conduct its own investigation into war crime allegations. Earlier that year, then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/sri-lanka-must-improve-human-rights-record-un-rights-chief.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to improve its human rights record</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A majority of British citizens voting in a referendum Thursday chose to leave the EU. The vote, an extension of British discontent with the EU, defied the suggestions of economists and British leaders, including Prime minister David Cameron, who stated that he plans to resign as a result of the decision. There were many reasons for the citizens' desire to split from the EU, not the least of which was <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21701265-how-minimise-damage-britains-senseless-self-inflicted-blow-tragic-split">immigration</a> [The Economist report]. The EU grants free movement of member citizens and, as immigration in Britain has continued to surge, public rejection of free movement has garnered increased support. In departing from the EU, Britain would be able to "take back control" of immigration, but here is uncertainty as to how immigration will be handled going forward. Assuming Brexit takes effect, many have called for an <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a874de26-34b2-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153.html#axzz4CVcJt3Oq">Australian immigration system</a> [Financial Times article], in which a point system is set up based upon certain characteristics, including language, work experience, occupation, etc. Regardless of the path the British government chooses to follow, changes in immigration policy will likely have serious implications for the Britain, as EU immigrant workers "account for almost 8 per cent of the 5.7m people employed in shops, hotels and restaurants."</p>

<p>The implications of this move extend beyond just immigration, though, as many believe this separation will negatively effect the British economy, which will likely be cut off from the EU's single market, unless an agreement between the two can be reached. Concern over the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-idUSKCN0Z902K">economic health of Britain</a> [Reuters report] going into the future led to a global market plunge today, as the pound fell as far as 10 percent against the dollar&#8212;a low not seen since 1985. While the vote has fallen in favor of departure, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/legal-implications-britain-votes-leave-eu-brexit">no legal changes have taken place yet</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], as Britain must take further steps to confirm its separation. The EU has set out a mechanism for leaving in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [materials] of the Lisbon Treaty, where a member state "may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements," and "must notify the European council of its intention." Under Article 50, a member country can only be removed from the EU two years after notification. While Britain might bypass this process through repeal of the European Communities Act of 1972, it is believed that this would make coming to a preferential trade agreement with the EU more difficult. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://global.tbmm.gov.tr/">Turkish parliament</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/Tutanak_B_SD.birlesim_baslangic?P4=22673&P5=H&PAGE1=1&PAGE2=1">granted immunity</a> [legislative record] to armed forces conducting counter-terrorism measures. This legislation is particularly concerning because of the number of civilians killed in the midst of recent conflict. The law, <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20160624091240-v5uuv/?source=hpMostPopularTheWire">to be applied retroactively</a> [Reuters report], will require authorization from either the military or government before prosecution can take place. Those in favor of the bill hope it will show support for the armed forces as the country faces an increase in terrorism. Those who opposed the law feared for its impact on any development the country hopes to make in terms of human rights. Many in opposition are also concerned the bill will give the military too much control -- urging the rest of parliament to learn from the past. </p>

<p>Turkey and its treatment of human rights are cause for concern due to the growing partnership with the EU caused by the refugee crisis. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a deal with Turkey in March to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/turkey-eu-violating-international-law-by-breaking-migrant-pact.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] last week that EU states are violating international law by breaking their migrant pact with Turkey by not allowing the country to extradite suspected terrorists. In April the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, called on Turkey to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">focus on human rights</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Also in April Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/amnesty-turkey-forcibly-returning-syria-refugees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey has been forcibly returning up to 100 refugees to Syria per day and expressed concern for the possible future of transported migrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) <a href="http://especiales.presidencia.gov.co/Documents/20160622-acuerdo-cese-fuego-dejacion-armas/acuerdo-cese-fuego.html">signed a ceasefire</a> [materials, in Spanish], marking an end to more than 50 years of armed conflict between the two groups. Among its terms are a demobilization plan and a security guarantee for all members of FARC as it becomes a peaceful political party. This <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/colombia-farc-sign-historic-ceasefire-deal-160623182953458.html">agreement</a> [Al Jazeera report] is the final step in the peace negotiations between the two, begun in 2012, and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said that he hopes to have the ceasefire signed and completed in July. Despite the positive movements towards the end to violence, questions remain in regards to implementation of a peace agreement. Implementing effective disarmament and demobilization plans, and providing justice for those affected by the violence are all issues which will need to be faced in achieving lasting peace. Santos hopes to hold a public referendum signifying popular approval for the agreement, but he fears that too many voters may stay home, leaving the referendum below the required participation threshold. These issues are only furthered complicated by political opposition, including former President Alvaro Uribe, who believe that the peace agreement "damages the word 'peace,'" and that members of FARC should be imprisoned for their war crimes.<br />

Criminal activity by illegal armed groups has been an ongoing issue within Colombia, with progress made during peace talks last year. Last year Colombian Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-president-pardons-30-farc-guerrilla-soldiers.php">pardoned</a> 30 former guerrilla soldiers in jail for non-violent crimes. In June 2014 the country's government and the FARC <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/revolutionary-armed-forces-of-colombia-agree-to-truth-commission.php">rebels agreed to create</a> [JURIST reports] a truth commission to investigate the deaths of thousands of people in the last five decades of the country's conflict. In March 2014 Human Rights Watch issued a <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-illegal-armed-groups-force-inhabitants-to-flee-buenaventura-columbia.php">report</a> [JURIST report] stating that illegal armed groups have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/colombia0314webwcover_1.pdf">caused hundreds of people</a> [official report, PDF] to flee Colombia's main Pacific port of Buenaventura in the previous two years. And in August 2013 Colombia's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/colombia-high-court-rules-peace-law-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law providing reduced penalties for rebels who confess crimes related to their membership in illegal armed groups is constitutional. FARC has been fighting the Colombian government since 1964, seeking to establish a communist government in the Republic of Colombia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Karim Wade, son of former Senegalese president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-16905528">Abdoulaye Wade</a> [BBC backgrounder], was released from prison on Friday following a presidential pardon by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14093756">President Macky Sall</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Wade, who served three years of his six-year sentence, was convicted of illegally enriching himself with at least $200 million while serving as Minister of State under his father in 2012. The conviction came after Sall took office and promised to crackdown on corruption. The court ruling had provided that Wade hid the funds in offshore accounts in both Panama and the British Virgin Islands. While in prison, Wade, who continues to deny the charges, was chosen to be the presidential candidate for the major opposition party, the Senagalese Democratic Party, in 2019. Wade was immediately <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/senegal-karim-wade-released-prison-160624085019612.html">flown to Qatar</a> [Al Jazeera report] after his release.</p>

<p>Abdoulaye Wade served as president of Senegal from 2000-2012. Since Abdoulaye Wade exited office in 2012, a number of government officials in Senegal have been investigated for charges of illegal enrichment. Karim Wade's imprisonment has received international attention. <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/Senegal-Karim-Wade-on-hunger-strike-assault-court/-/1066/2591058/-/qkitha/-/index.html">He refused to attend court sessions</a> [AFP report] after one of his lawyers was expelled from a hearing, and his entire legal staff began boycotting proceedings. Karim Wade referred to himself as a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28582840">political prisoner</a> [BBC report] during his first appearance in court for the corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A South African court  on Friday <a href="http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPPHC/2016/489.pdf">denied</a> [decision, PDF] President Jacob Zuma's appeal of a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-high-court-orders-review-of-783-corruption-charges-against-president-zuma.php">prior court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that he should face nearly 800 corruption charges. Judge Aubrey Ledwaba stated "[w]e seriously considered whether the appeal would have reasonable prospects of success and came to the conclusion that there are not merits in the arguments." Consequently, the court further stated "prosecution against President Jacob must proceed and he must have his day in court." Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/jacob-zuma-appeals-ruling-reinstating-corruption-charges.php">initiated his appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the lower court decision two weeks ago. Though Zuma is not eligible for office again, the charges against Zuma could have harmful implications on his party, the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/">African National Congress</a> (ANC), as the <a href="https://www.da.org.za/">Democratic Alliance</a> (DA) [official website] and <a href="http://effighters.org.za/">Economic Freedom Fighters</a> (EFF) [party websites] hope to steal votes in the upcoming municipal elections.</p>

<p>The South African president has been embroiled in legal trouble for the past several months. Zuma <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/south-africa-president-zuma-beats-impeachment.php">evaded impeachment</a> [JURIST report] in April after the ANC reaffirmed its support for the president. The move to impeach Zuma came from opposition leaders after the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-president-ordered-to-repay-use-of-public-money-for-private-purposes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in March that he had ignored the order of the Public Protector to personally repay the amounts determined by the National Treasury, as they relate to the "non-security" upgrades to his private residence. Zuma has been at the center of political controversy for years. Zuma was <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/south-african-deputy-president-fired.php">ousted</a> as the country's deputy president in 2005 after an aide was convicted of corruption. He was also charged with rape, but he was ultimately <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/anc-reinstates-zuma-as-deputy.php">acquitted and reinstated</a> [JURIST reports] as ANC deputy vice president. In July 2008 the South African Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">rejected a motion</a> [JURIST report] by Zuma to exclude evidence from the corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the Directorate of Special Investigations should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the warrants used in the raids, confirming a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">November 2007 decision</a> by the Supreme Court of Appeal. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Hawaii <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/">Governor David Ige</a> [official website] <a href="http://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/governors-office-news-release-hawaii-becomes-first-state-in-nation-to-enroll-firearms-owners-in-centralized-information-system/">signed a bill</a> [press release] Thursday requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state. The legislation, <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2016/bills/SB2954_HD1_.HTM">SB 2954</a> [materials], serves to provide a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. According to Ige, the purpose of the bill is to "evaluate whether the firearm owner may continue to legally possess firearms," and he hopes that the so-called "Rap Back" system will "better enable [Hawaii's] law enforcement agencies to ensure the security of all Hawai'i residents and visitors," to Hawaii. The governor also signed two other bills, one that lists harassment by stalking and sexual assault as offenses that disqualify one from purchasing and keeping a firearm, and another that requires owners deemed unqualified due to "behavioral, emotional, or mental disorder, or emergency or involuntary hospitalization to a psychiatric facility" to surrender their firearms and ammunition to the Chief of Police. Hawaii is the first state to sign such a system into a centralized information system into law.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial national topics, and gun awareness has risen in the wake of recent shootings across the nation. Last month the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Second Amendment protects the <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-second-amendment-protects-right-to-buy-and-sell-guns.php">right to buy and sell guns</a> [JURIST report]. In February the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a case addressing firearm possession for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pursuant an <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/069_order_granting_plaintiff_g.g.s_motion_for_preliminary_injunction_2016.06.23.pdf">order</a> [order, PDF] issued Thursday by a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], a Virginia school board must allow a transgender student to use the restroom that corresponds with his gender identity. Gavin Grimm, a high school student at a Gloucester County school who identifies as male, will be allowed to use the boys' restroom while the court considers the legal issues of the case. This order comes after a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/074_decision_2016.04.19_0.pdf">decision</a> [official website] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in April, which reversed a lower court decision in holding Grimm's rights under <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX</a> [official website], which prohibits discrimination in schools, were violated by the school board refusing his use of the men's restroom. The Gloucester County School Board has stated its intention to ask the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] to review the Fourth Circuit decision.</p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Last month the Obama administration issued guidance to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by eleven states. Also last month, the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] president John Ashe, who was under corruption investigation by US authorities, died on Thursday after suffering neck trauma. Ashe's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/24/barbell-accident-kills-former-un-leader-accused-of-corruption">death</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], "traumatic asphyxia," was the result of a weightlifting accident in which he dropped a barbell on his neck. While Ashe had only been charged with tax fraud to this point, prosecutors were planning to bring a new charge against him, despite possible diplomatic immunity to bribery accusations. Cases still remain against Ng and Jeff Yin, his assistant, who are claimed to have helped bribe Ashe. Ashe had served as president from 2013 to 2014.</p>

<p>Ashe was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/former-unga-president-charged-in-corruption-scheme.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly taking part in a scheme to receive $1.3 million in bribes to conduct official actions supporting Chinese business interests. Deputy UN Ambassador for the Dominican Republic Francis Lorenzo and three other defendants were also <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-un-general-assembly-president-and-five-others-charged-13-million-bribery-scheme">charged</a> [press release]. The Attorney's Office believes Ashe has been accepting bribes since 2011 facilitated by Lorenzo. According to the complaint, Lorenzo approached Ashe in 2010 to take part in the scheme. Lorenzo invited Ashe to Macau, China, to meet one of the other defendants, Ng Lap Seng, who was seeking support for a UN Macau Conference Center. In exchange for submitting reports to the UN in support conference center, Ashe allegedly began soliciting money from Ng. Lorenzo also hired Ashe's wife to be a "climate change consultant" in his non-governmental organization. According to the US Attorney, Ashe also solicited other businessmen who wanted to invest with Antiguan government officials. He allegedly failed to report this income in his 2013 and 2014 income tax returns.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ohnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Ohio</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CitizensForTrump.v.Cleveland-023-TranscriptOfCourtProceedings-2016_0623.pdf">ruled</a> [transcript, PDF] Thursday that Cleveland's time and place restrictions governing protests and marches during next month's <a href="http://convention.gop/about">Republic National Convention</a> [official website] infringe upon the right to free expression. After listening to arguments, Judge James Gwin ruled the restrictions were not "sufficiently narrowly drawn ... to serve a significant governmental interest." The <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/46ed6df979d84d40a2c1d1801b227d1c/judge-scraps-clevelands-protest-rules-gop-convention">city's regulations</a> [AP report] had initially placed a large portion of the protest route on a bridge, where there is lack of visibility, and set the hours for protest and marching at a time when the convention delegates would not be present at Quicken Loans Arena, where the convention is being held. The judge also suggested that the <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio</a> [advocacy website], which had brought the suit on behalf of two groups planning events, and the city of Cleveland meet and negotiate new terms for protests and marches. The parties did meet and have come to terms, and the court issued an order to <a href="http://www.acluohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CitizensForTrump.v.Cleveland-027-OrderDismissingCase-2016_0624.pdf">dismiss</a> [order, PDF] the case.</p>

<p>Many activists have also had concerns with the actions of local law enforcement agents in the Cleveland area. Local police officers and FBI agents have begun <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/rnc-2016/index.ssf/2016/06/fbi_police_visit_activists_hom.html">"door-knock"</a> [Cleveland.com report] visits to political activists houses, with the claimed intention of ensuring a safe GOP convention. Human rights activists have stated they view the visits as an attempt to intimidate potential protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN human rights experts on cultural rights and on freedom of expression, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/CulturalRights/Pages/SRCulturalRightsIndex.aspx">Karima Bennoune</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/DavidKaye.aspx">David Kaye</a> [official websites], called Friday for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20172&LangID=E">release of artists</a> [press release] jailed by the Islamic Republic of Iran. In particular, they called upon Iran to release two musicians, Mehdi Rajabian and Yousef Emadi, and a filmmaker, Hossein Rajabian, charged with "insulting Islamic sanctities," "propoganda against the State" and "conducting illegal activities in the audiovisual affaires including through producing prohibited audiovisual material and performing an illegal and underground music site." The three artists, after appeal, were sentenced to three years in prison and fined $50 million Rial each. While they acknowledged that their prison sentences had been reduced, the experts called the sentences "unacceptable and in complete violation of international human rights law binding on Iran."</p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its human rights abuses. In March UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-rate-of-juvenile-executions-in-iran.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the overwhelming number of juvenile executions in Iran.  Last October UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-experts-condemn-iran-execution-of-juvenile-offenders.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran's execution of a juvenile offender convicted of murdering her husband whom she was forced to marry at the age of 16. She was executed despite several reports of flaws in her trial and appeals process. Also in October an Iranian Revolutionary Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/washington-post-journalist-convicted-in-iran-court.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <em>Washington Post</em> correspondent Jason Rezaian, who was later released. In May of last year UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-experts-condemn-increase-in-iran-executions.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the growing number of executions in Iran in recent years. According to the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Iran and on extrajudicial executions, Iran had executed approximately six people per day between April 9 and April 26 and 350 total up to that point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/">American Civil Liberties of Northern California</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/06.24.16_doc._1_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Friday against the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> [official website] (HHS) for allowing religious agencies taking in refugees to refuse female immigrant minors access to reproductive health services, including abortions and birth control. The ACLU contends that the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), through HHS, has approved grants to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and other groups with similarly held religious or pro-life beliefs, and allowed these organizations "to refuse on religious grounds to provide information about, access to, or referrals for contraception and abortion, even if the young person in their care has been raped." These organizations have also be allowed to remove young women seeking these services from their current shelter.  This infringement upon the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause of the First Amendment</a> [materials], the ACLU contends, serves to deny these young women their constitutionally guaranteed right to health and reproductive health services, and relocation of those seeking these services to other facilities only serves to "unfairly stigmatize [these women] for choosing to terminate the pregnancy, and uproot [them] from the support network" at their original facility. The complaint provides several examples of young migrant women who faced difficulties in obtaining these services. The ACLU requests a permanent injunction on the ORR to make sure that HSA and TVPRA  grants given for providing refugee relocation services are not provided to organizations imposing religious-based restrictions.</p>

<p>Religious objection to <a href="/feature/2013/07/contraception-and-reproductive-rights.php">reproductive health care</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a highly-contested issue in the US. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurance companies and employers have been forced to cover the cost of contraceptives and reproductive health care. Passage of the ACA was followed by a series of lawsuits by religious groups, including a <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">Supreme Court decision</a> [JURIST report] that closely held for-profit corporations can deny coverage of contraception costs because of their religious beliefs. <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/detail.php#FederalLitigation">Abortion</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has also been a contentious issue, leading to a slew of <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-governor-signs-two-abortion-restrictions-into-law.php">state-government restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on access to abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia's lower house of Parliament, the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a>, [official website] passed a number of counter-terrorism amendments on Friday. Dubbed the <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/7eada1518b0e48098aca2088e37d2720/russia-adopts-controversial-counter-terrorism-amendments">"Yarovaya Law"</a> [AP report] after their key drafter, the anti-terror laws <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/russia-counterterrorism-yarovaya-law.html?_r=0">ban</a> [NYT report] proselytizing, preaching and praying outside officially recognized religious institutions. They also criminalize failure to report certain types of crimes and force cellular and internet providers to store all communications data for six months and to help security services decipher all messaging applications. An application's owner would face a fine of one million roubles (approximately US$15,000) if they decline to decrypt messages. Citizens, officials, and legal entities could <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/21/kremlin_wants_to_shoot_the_messenger_and_whatsapp_to_boot/">face fines</a> [<em>The Register</em> report] between 3,000 and 50,000 roubles for refusing to allow law enforcement to read their messages.</p>

<p>The provisions approved by the Russian Parliament have been controversial, with human rights activists arguing the measures curtail basic human rights. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/23/draconian-law-rammed-through-russian-parliament">believes</a> [report] that the bill approved on Friday could limit fundamental freedoms. Activists have been critical of the measures for undermining the right to privacy, freedom of conscience, and the ambiguous nature of criminalizing failures to report crimes. Internet and messaging application representatives have been <a href="https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/23/russian-activists-and-industry-speak-out-against-new-draconian-anti-terrorist-laws/">critical</a> [<em>Global Voices</em> report] of the measures because the requirements would force the industry to increase expenses and also limit the "rights of businesses and users." Others have been critical of the measure because it could <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/russian-mps-approve-anti/2903416.html">undermine</a> [<em>Channel News Asia</em> report] freedom of speech by regulating social media networks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] officials said on Friday that the Pentagon will announce the repeal of its ban on openly transgender service members on July 1. Each branch of the US Armed Forces <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/24/ban-transgender-troops-lifted-july-1/86347902/">will be adopting policies</a> [USA Today report] that cover recruiting, housing, and uniforms for transgender service members, according to the official. Transgender troops are disqualified for medical reasons and figures for how many troops have been dismissed are unavailable. However, under current policies, transgender service members have still managed to join the military by keeping their status <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/us/pentagon-set-to-lift-ban-on-transgender-people-serving-in-us-military.html?_r=0">concealed</a> [NYT report]. There are an estimated 2,000 to 15,000 transgender troops <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/us-military-to-repeal-ban-transgender-personnel">serving</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the military and it is also estimated that 65 service members seek to make a gender transition every year. </p>

<p>Transgender peoples' access to basic civil liberties has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. This week, a judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a Virginia school board to allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. This month, a judge from Multnomah County Circuit Court in Oregon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/oregon-court-recognizes-non-binary-as-a-legal-gender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an individual's gender could be legally changed from female to non-binary." Also this month, a US magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-transgender-inmate-must-be-given-access-to-female-items.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order requiring California prions to provide transgender inmates who identify as female access to female-oriented items to which inmates have access in women's correctional facilities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government of Kuwait <a href="http://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=2508434&language=en">filed</a> [KUNA press release] a lawsuit in Swiss court on Thursday against the <a href="https://www.olympic.org/ioc">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) [official website] seeking $1 billion in damages for its suspension of the Kuwaiti Olympic Committee (KOC). The IOC has said that it <a href="https://www.olympic.org/news/suspension-of-the-kuwait-olympic-committee">suspended</a> [press release] the KOC last October "to protect the Olympic Movement in Kuwait from undue government interference." The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the world football governing body, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36605629">issued</a> [BBC report] a similar suspension against Kuwait the same month. The issue stems from the Kuwaiti government's ability to dissolve sports clubs, federations and the KOC. Information Minister Sheikh Salman al-Humoud Al-Sabah <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/kuwait-sues-ioc-1bn-olympic-suspension-160623101228231.html">said</a> [Al Jazeera report] that his government has sent a UN-sponsored delegation to Geneva to "explain to the sports body that the Kuwaiti government by no means intervenes in sports activities." The Kuwaiti government <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/suspended-kuwait-seeks-1-bn-in-damages-from-international-olympic-committee/article8764299.ece">filed</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] a similar suit in a domestic court against 15 Kuwaiti sports officials that allegedly sought the suspension in January. Sixteen other international sporting federations have also blacklisted Kuwait.</p>

<p>Kuwait has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/27/ioc-kuwait-ban-olympic-government-interference">suspended</a> [Reuters report] from the Olympics twice in the last five years. Kuwait was suspended from the Olympics in 2015 and if the ban remains in place for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Kuwaiti athletes will be able to compete, but under the Olympic rather than the Kuwaiti flag. The IOC <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-kuwait-idUSKCN0WL0WJ">insisted</a> [Reuters report] that the government of Kuwait change Kuwaiti sports law to lift the ban. The Kuwaiti government has maintained that it cannot change its laws without its Parliament as a democratic country with due process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/06/24/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-actions-reduce-recidivism-and">announced</a> [press release] on Friday a series of programs aimed at ensuring that former prisoners have better resources to transition back into the community. The administration said that improving education and job opportunities can reduce crime. One of the programs will provide 12,000 state and federal prison inmates government funding in order for them to take college courses. The measures will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-whitehouse-idUSKCN0ZA0DQ">link</a> [Reuters report] 67 colleges and universities with 141 correctional facilities to provide education and training offer federal Pell grants to prisoners, and offer grants to organizations to offer occupational training and apprenticeship opportunities. Other programs will also provide funding to organizations to provide job training to young adults, develop career pathways programs for residents of high-poverty areas, and provide mentorship and career training to high school students at risk of dropping out.</p>

President Obama has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/01/presidential-memorandum-limiting-use-restrictive-housing-federal">commuted</a> [press release] the sentences of more men and women than the past six presidents combined, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/barack-obama-why-we-must-rethink-solitary-confinement/2016/01/25/29a361f2-c384-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html">ordered</a> [WP report] the Attorney General to review the use of solitary confinement.

		<title>Cameroon parliament votes for gender-balanced adultery ban</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Cameroon's parliament voted on Wednesday for the country's penal code to punish men and women for adultery under equal terms. Though adultery was already a criminal act for both genders, the penal code previously <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/cameroon-men-jailed-adultery-women-40077335">punished</a> [AP report] women for committing any adulterous act while only punishing men for adultery committed in the home or "habitually elsewhere." The adjusted law charges adulterers with two to six months jail time or fines of up to about $175. The changes were pushed by <a href="https://www.prc.cm/en/the-president/biography">President Paul Biya</a> [official profile] and are expected to be supported by both the president and the senate moving forward. </p>

<p>Discrimination and the rights of women remain global issues. In February the Supreme Court of South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/south-korea-court-strikes-down-adultery-ban.php">decriminalized adultery</a> [JURIST report] after finding the law of concern to be unconstitutional. A UN report this month stated that young girls have been <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-report-girls-facing-violence-for-seeking-education.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] in 70 countries for pursuing an education. Also in February UN officials <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-experts-press-for-end-to-female-genital-mutilation.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to all female mutilation. Last month the UN urged El Salvador to <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-experts-urge-el-salvador-to-pardon-women-jailed-for-pregnancy-related-complications.php">pardon women</a> [JURIST report] jailed for seeking abortions due to rape or pregnancy complications. In a criticized decision last month, a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/uk-court-upholds-regulation-on-legal-aid-for-domestic-violence.php">upheld a regulation</a> [JURIST report] that requires domestic violence victims to provide specific types of evidence before obtaining legal assistance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/english/">Cyberspace Administration of China </a> (CAC) [official website] on Saturday announced that search companies must abide by new internet regulations. The CAC <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-issues-new-internet-search-rules-following-baidu-probe-1466920307">stated</a> [WSJ report] that search companies must produce results in line with national interests and must clearly distinguish normal results from paid ads which may display illegal and misleading information. Search companies are also required to properly report illegal content which may threaten national security or negatively impact public judgment. The new regulations follow an investigation into Chinese search company <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu Inc.</a> [official website, in Chinese] which began six weeks prior. The investigation was a response to raised national concerns triggered by the death of a cancer-stricken internet user who used Baidu as a source of medical information. Baidu has declared that it will firmly comply with new internet regulations and has promised to provide more reliable search results. </p>

<p>The Chinese government has been criticized for passing national security laws that tighten its control of civil society. Last July, China <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/china-adopts-new-national-security-law.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a new national security law that increased its cyber security powers, allowing authorities to broaden internet oversight and crack down harder against cyber attacks, thefts and the spread of harmful information. UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/un-rights-chief-criticizes-chinas-vague-national-security-law.php">deplored</a> [JURIST report] the new law, criticizing its extraordinarily broad scope, vague language, and its threat to the freedom of expression. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent measures taken by Brazil's interim president, <a href="http://micheltemer.com.br/">Michel Temer</a> [official website, in Portuguese], are "negative steps for a country known for its solid commitment to freedom of opinion and expression," according to a joint <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20176&LangID=E">statement</a> [press release] by UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye and OAS Inter-American Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Edison Lanza. Several recent actions by Temer's government have caused concern, including the termination of the chief executive officer of the <a href="http://www.ebc.com.br/">Brazilian Public Broadcaster</a> (EBC) [official website, in Portuguese] in May. The executive was reinstated in his position after appealing to the nation's highest court, but several journalists' contracts were terminated in this time because of an alleged political bias. The government also merged the National Controller&#8217;s Office (CGU), into the Ministry of Transparency, Monitoring and Oversight. The experts say this is troubling because the CGU played a critical role in promoting access of information in Brazil. According to news reports, Temer will also <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazils-Temer-Looks-to-Shut-Down-Public-TV-20160617-0039.html">introduce a bill</a> [<em>TeleSur</em> report] in the legislature that would dissolve the EBC's council and enact budget cuts that would lead to the shut down of TV Brasil. The human rights experts wrote that "&#8220;Brazil is undergoing a critical period and should ensure it preserves the progress it has made in the promotion of freedom of expression and access to public information over the last two decades."</p>

<p>Michele Temer was made interim president while <a href="http://dilma.com.br/">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [official website, in Portuguese] goes through her impeachment trial. In May, the senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-president-suspended-following-senate-vote-for-impeachment-trial.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to initiate the impeachment trial against Rousseff for allegedly borrowing from state banks to cover a deficit and pay for social programs to secure her re-election in 2014. In the time that Temer has served as interim president, UN experts have also <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-brazil-must-advance-business-and-human-rights.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Brazil to place more emphasis on remedying and preventing business-related human rights violations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">Texas law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore unconstitutional. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> found for the plaintiffs, but the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official websites] largely <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14-50928-CV0.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court and allowed for enforcement of the statute state wide, with limited exceptions. On appeal of that ruling, the Supreme Court reversed, finding that the Fifth Circuit erred in its application of the <span class="casename">Casey</span> standard, with particular reference to the Fifth Circuit's finding that "the district court erred by substituting its own judgment for that of the legislature" in part because "medical uncertainty underlying a statute is for resolution by legislatures, not the courts.&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority, finding that "when determining the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion procedures, [the Court] has placed considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in judicial proceedings" and approved of the district court's treatment of the standard.<br />
<blockquote>For a district court to give significant weight to evidence in the judicial record in these circumstances is consistent with this Court&#8217;s case law. [The District Court] did not simply substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature. It considered the evidence in the record &mdash; including expert evidence, presented in stipulations, depositions, and testimony. It then weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens.</blockquote>Reviewing the evidence submitted at trial, the Court found that neither the admitting privileges and ambulatory surgery requirements furthered the stated interest in protecting the health of abortion patients, and that both requirements posed "substantial obstacles to women seeking abortions." Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion arguing that the decision "perpetuates the Court&#8217;s habit of applying different rules to different constitutional rights &mdash; especially the putative right to abortion." Justice Samuel Alito also filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and by Thomas. </p>

<p>An additional issue concerned whether the case should have been precluded by an earlier suit filed challenging the HB2 restrictions on their face, rather than as applied through enforcement. These facial challenges, which included some but not all of the same plaintiffs, were <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8769661596643845298">denied</a> [opinion] by the Fifth Circuit. Rather than appeal that ruling directly, some Texas abortion providers filed the as-applied suit that led to Monday's ruling. Texas had argued that the earlier Fifth Circuit ruling had addressed the providers' claims, and thus they were precluded from re-litigating the issues addressed in that suit. The Supreme Court found that the providers' claims were not precluded because the as-applied challenged rested on the occurrence of facts that were merely the basis of conjecture in the facial challenge. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/post-2.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in November and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-texas-abortion-law.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-474_ljgm.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mcdonnell-v-united-states/">McDonnell v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell's conduct did not constitute an "official act" sufficient to support his corruption conviction. McDonnell was found guilty of official corruption in 2014 after accepting gifts and loans from the CEO of dietary supplement company Star Scientific in exchange for assisting the company in securing university testing of one of its products. He challenged his conviction on the grounds that none of his conduct, including arranging meetings for company officials and hosting company events at his official residence, met the definition of an "official act" under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201">bribery statute</a> [18 U.S.C. &sect; 201(a)(3) text] at issue. The Supreme Court agreed, rejecting the government's broad interpretation of the term, and adopting "a more bounded interpretation." With this interpretation in mind, the court found that McDonnell's conviction had been based on erroneous jury instructions. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts noted the continued viability of the bribery statute despite a stricter reading of the term "official act."<br />
<blockquote>There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that. But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government&#8217;s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term &#8220;official act&#8221; leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this Court.</blockquote>The court remanded the case to the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of an "official act" under the new interpretation to support a new trial. </p>

<p>In 2014 McDonnell and his wife Maureen were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/03/bob-mcdonnell-corruption-trial/13484543/">accused</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the CEO of Star Scientific, in exchange for favors for and promotions of the company. The McDonnells were found guilty of the 11 counts of corruption, and Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years and Maureen received a sentence of one year and one day. An attorney for Bob McDonnell <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/former-virginia-governor-will-appeal-public-corruption-conviction.php">said he would appeal</a> [JURIST report] his public corruption convictions to the Supreme Court after the Fourth Circuit refused to reconsider the case. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in January and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-former-virginia-governors-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-10154_19m1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF]  6-2 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/voisine-v-united-states/">Voisine v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Stephen Voisine and William Armstrong had pleaded guilty to violating a <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/17-A/title17-Asec207.html">Maine statute</a> [text] that makes it a misdemeanor to &#8220;intentionally, knowingly or recklessly cause[ ] bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.&#8221; When later investigations revealed that both men were in possession of firearms, they were charged and convicted under a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">federal law</a> [18 U.S.C. &sect; 922 text] that prohibits any person convicted of "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" from possessing firearms and ammunition. On appeal, the petitioners argued that, because their domestic violence convictions were based on recklessness, and not intentional or knowing conduct, they were insufficient to support the federal charge. Focusing on the meaning of "use ... physical force," the Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the convictions. Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan found that <blockquote>the word &#8220;use&#8221; does not demand that the person applying force have the purpose or practical certainty that it will cause harm, as compared with the understanding that it is substantially likely to do so. Or, otherwise said, that word is indifferent as to whether the actor has the mental state of intention, knowledge, or recklessness with respect to the harmful consequences of his volitional conduct.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined in part. The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-adds-firearm-possession-case-to-docket.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in November and heard <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-domestic-violence-recusal.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports]  in February. </p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Last week, Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062716zor_4fbi.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] for two new cases next term, and noted probable jurisdiction to another. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/life-technologies-corporation-v-promega-corporation/">Life Technologies Corporation v. Promega Corporation</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] the Court has been asked to determine whether the sale of a single component of a multiple part invention from the United States constitutes a patent infringement under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/271">35 U.S.C. &sect; 271(f)(1)</a> [text], making the manufacturer liable for all claims worldwide. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] previously <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4931425235324173809">held</a> [opinion] that such sales do constitute an infringement under the statute. In particular, the court stated that a company need not seek to influence or persuade another company to create an infringement, but merely enable a violation under &sect; 271(f)(1).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/beckles-v-united-states/">Beckles v. United States</a>, the Court has been asked to address whether its ruling in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/johnson-v-united-states-3/">Johnson v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders], where the Court held imposing an enhanced sentence based upon the <a href="https://www.fd.org/docs/select-topics---common-offenses/acca.pdf">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [materials] was unconstitutional under a due process analysis, applies retroactively to collateral cases challenging enhanced sentences under the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manual/2015/GLMFull.pdf">United States Sentencing Guidelines</a> (USSG) [text, PDF] defining a "crime of violence." The appeal also asks whether <span class="casename">Johnson</span>'s due process analysis applies to the residual clause of the USSG, allowing for collateral review and whether possessing a sawed-off shotgun is a "crime of violence" after <span class="casename">Johnson</span>. The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] had previously held that "<span class="casename">Johnson</span> says and decided nothing about career-offender enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines or about the Guidelines commentary underlying Beckles' status as a career-offender," and thus affirmed Beckles' enhanced sentence.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/mccrory-v-harris/">McCrory v. Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court noted probable jurisdiction to determine whether actions taken by North Carolina relied too much on race when they redrew the state's congressional districts. North Carolina, through its governor, <a href="https://governor.nc.gov/">Patrick McCrory</a> [official website], is challenging the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina's</a> [official website] decision, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-1262-Op-Bel-MD-NC.pdf">declaring</a> [decision, PDF] several of the districts to be in violation of the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act </a> (VRA) [text]. Among the potential issues are whether the court erred in requiring the state to show that make-up of "Congressional District 1 was 'actually necessary' under the VRA instead of simply showing it had 'good reasons' to believe" the redistricting would prevent future vote dilution claims and whether the court should not removed the plaintiff's burden to show the districts were created for "race rather than politics." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/torturevictimsday/2016/sgmessage.shtml">expressed</a> [official statement] his support for the end to torture under all circumstances on Monday. Speaking on <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/torturevictimsday/index.shtml">International Day in Support of Victims of Torture</a> [UN materials], Ban called the legal prohibition of torture "crystal clear," and stated that the practice can "never be used at any time or under any circumstances, including during conflict or when national security is under threat.". In his statement, Ban <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54325#.V3JuOPkrKUl">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] that, "despite its absolute prohibition under international law, this dehumanizing practice remains pervasive and, most disturbingly, is even gaining acceptance." He pointed to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">Convention Against Torture</a> [OHCHR materials] which obligates states to prevent torture and redress, compensate and rehabilitate those victims of torture within their jurisdiction. He also asked each of state that ratified the Convention Against Torture, including 159 UN member states to date, to support the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/UNVFT/Pages/Index.aspx">UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture</a> [UN materials].</p>

<p>The use of torture as an interrogation technique has created many legal problems for the US government as well as other entities. Last April, a federal judge from the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-rules-lawsuit-against-creators-of-cia-interrogation-program-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/27._defendants_motion_to_dismiss_1.08.16.pdf">lawsuit</a> [brief, PDF] against two former military psychologists who developed the CIA's interrogation program under former US President George W. Bush may proceed. In February <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International USA </a>[advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-calls-for-medical-treatment-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of the accused 9/11 ringleaders, was in desperate need of medical care in a letter to the Pentagon. In the letter the agency stated that Hawsawi was in severe rectal distress due to interrogation methods that amounted to torture and that he had yet to receive adequate medical care. In December <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/hrw-urges-prosecution-of-cia-officials-for-post-911-torture.php">called </a> [JURIST report] for the criminal prosecution of CIA and other US government officials for their participation in torture programs following the 9/11 terrorist attack. In August 2014 10 victims of the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=extraordinary%20rendition&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">CIA's extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive] signed an <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/cia-rendition-victims-urge-obama-to-name-them-in-senate-report.php">open letter</a> [JURIST report] to US President Barack Obama urging him to declassify the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the program. JURIST Guest Columnist Benjamin G Davis of the University of Toledo College of Law recently <a href="/forum/2015/11/benjamin-davis-all-lives.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the barriers that survivors of torture face in obtaining redress through the US court system..</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/151441p.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.viacom.com/">Viacom</a> [corporate websites] are not liable for planting "cookies" on children's computers to gather data for advertisers.  In a class action lawsuit, parents <a href="https://epic.org/amicus/vppa/nickelodeon/Complaint.pdf">claim</a> [complaint, PDF] that the companies are illegally <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/google-beats-childrens-privacy-appeal-viacom-must-face-153436215--finance.html?ref=gs">collecting data</a> [Reuters report] about children who watch videos and play video games on the <a href="http://www.nick.com/">Nickelodeon</a> [corporate website] website. Writing for the court, Circuit Judge Julio Fuentes found that the court's ruling in last year's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11228916892177508504&q=806+F.3d+125&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39"><span class="casename">In Re Google Cookie Placement</span></a> [text] foreclosed many of the plaintiff's claims, and that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2710">Video Privacy Protection Act</a> [text] was not violated as it was meant to thwart the collection of data to help monitor people's video-watching, not to cover the collection of data such as IP addresses and settings. Fuentes also wrote the opinion last November finding that Google was not liable under federal privacy laws for bypassing cookie blockers on browsers. The ruling preserves a state law privacy claim against Viacom only, alleging that it collected data on the site despite an express statement that it would not do so.</p>

<p>Google has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies and is currently facing worldwide suits over alleged violations. In December the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/google-facing-privacy-violation-complaint.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a personal privacy violation complaint with the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] against Google. In February 2014 a French court <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/france-court-rules-google-must-comply-with-publication-notice.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google must display on its French page that they have been fined by the local data-protection watchdog for how they store user information. In January 2014 the UK High Court  <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/uk-high-court-google-can-be-sued-in-the-uk.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google can be sued by British citizens. In November 2013 the Dutch Data Protection Agency (DPA) <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/germany-court-rules-google-violated-german-data-protection-law.php">stated that Google was in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the country's data protection act. Earlier that month a Berlin court held that 25 of Google's privacy policies and terms of service violated [JURIST report] Germany's data protection law. In September 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-googles-motion-to-dismiss-street-view-privacy-case.php">denied Google's motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit regarding the company's alleged violation of federal law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Norwegian court on Monday <a href="https://www.domstol.no/globalassets/upload/obyr/internett/nyheter/2016/kjennelse-i-sak-16-066986tvi-otir---edward-snowden---staten.pdf">denied</a> [decision, PDF, in Norwegian] a request by former <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-22837100">Edward Snowden</a> [BBC profile] seeking a guarantee that he would not be extradited to the US if he were to visit Norway. The <a href="http://norskpen.no/nb_NO/">Norwegian chapter</a> of <a href="http://www.pen-international.org/">PEN International</a> [official websites] awarded Snowden the <a href="http://norskpen.no/nb_NO/2016/03/07/edward-snowden-ossietzky-of-our-time/">2016 Ossietzky Prize</a> [press release] in recognition of his "outstanding efforts for freedom of expression." Snowden wishes to travel to Oslo in November to receive the prize, but sought assurances from the Norwegian government that he would not be extradited to the US on pending <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">espionage charges</a> [JURIST report] if he were to do so. The <a href="https://www.domstol.no/en/Enkelt-domstol/Oslo-District-Court/">Oslo District Court</a> [official website, in Norwegian] denied his request, finding that the Criminal Procedures Act requires that an extradition request be made before it can be assessed on its merits. In addition to Norwegian PEN, the <a href="http://www.nored.no/Association-of-Norwegian-Editors">Association of Norwegian Editors</a>, the <a href="http://presse.no/">Norwegian Press Association</a> and the <a href="https://www.nj.no/">Norwegian Union of Journalists</a> [advocacy websites, in Norwegian] also supported Snowden's bid for a guarantee of non-extradition.</p>

<p>Snowden, a former NSA contractor and computer professional, became famous in 2013 for leaking classified information. His leak ultimately led to significant revelations about global mass surveillance programs employed by various governments, particularly the US. In October,  the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] voted to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/european-parliament-vote-to-protect-snowden-from-extradition.php">approve</a> [JURIST report] a resolution encouraging its member countries not to extradite Snowden, and called upon its member states to drop all criminal charges against him and offer him protection as an "international human rights defender." The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and other US human rights organizations challenged the surveillance by the NSA, although the <a href="https://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Maryland</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-surveillance.php">dismissed one such case</a> [JURIST report] last October. The <a href="/forum/2013/07/tung-yin-edward-snowden.php">question of Snowden's guilt</a> [JURIST op-ed] and the legitimacy of the charges against him have been <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=5%2C4%2C6%2C&search=Snowden&limit=25&page=&author=&filtered=true&narrow=&authored=false">debated and analyzed</a> {JURIST news archive] widely in the U.S. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] On Tuesday the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062816zr_29m1.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order, PDF] for eight new cases. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lightfoot-v-cendant-mortgage-corporation/">Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortgage Company</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the Court is asked to determine whether the &#8220;sue or be sued&#8221; provision of the <a href="https://www.usa.gov/federal-agencies/federal-national-mortgage-association-(fannie-mae)">Federal National Mortgage Association's</a> (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) [official website] federal charter confers original jurisdiction to federal courts in all cases involving Fannie Mae. It is also asked to reverse <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/247">American National Red Cross v. S.G.</a> [opinion], a 1992 decision finding that no such jurisdiction was conferred by similar language in another federally chartered corporation.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/venezuela-v-helmerich-payne-international/">Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne International</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the Court, at the suggestion of the US Solicitor General, will make a determination upon whether the pleading standard for alleging that a case falls under the expropriation exception <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> (FSIA) [text] is more stringent than the &#8220;insubstantial and frivolous.&#8221; standard for pleading jurisdiction in a federal-question statute. The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">DC Circuit Court</a> [official website] had previously <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/13-7169-1550133.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that a lessened standard applied to claims being brought under the FSIA.</p>

<p>Next, in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/ivy-v-morath/">Ivy v. Morath</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the Court is being asked to determine whether a government agency is liable under the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.pdf">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text, PDF] for discrimination against disabled people, where the discrimination was caused by private actors contracted to perform services for the public entity. The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] had <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14-50037-CV0.pdf">previously held</a> [opinion, PDF] that such public agencies are only liable for discrimination &#8220;where the private actors had a contractual or agency relationship with the public entity.&#8221; The suit is being brought by hearing-impaired citizens seeking to force a private driver&#8217;s education program to provide a sign-language interpreter.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/fry-v-napoleon-community-schools/">Fry v. Napoleon Community School</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the Court is asked to determine whether the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/99/s415/text/enr">Handicapped Children&#8217;s Protection Act of 1986</a> [text], the ADA and the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/rehab_act-1973.html">Rehabilitation Act</a> [text], require administrative alternatives be exhausted before a suit for damages may be brought, as is required under the <a href="http://idea.ed.gov/download/statute.html">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (IDEA) [text]. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] had previously <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fry-op-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Frys&#8217; claim did require them to exhaust the administrative process because their claim involved denial of &#8220;free appropriate public education,&#8221; defined under the IDEA. That court was reticent to allow evasion of the exhaustion requirement because, where IDEA procedures can remedy a child&#8217;s educational injury, the court would &#8220;prevent state and local educational agencies from addressing problems they specialize in addressing&#8221; and require courts to address issues which they are not particularly adept at solving.</p>

<p>In consolidating the claims in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/visa-inc-v-osborn/">Visa v. Osborn</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/visa-inc-v-stoumbos/">Visa v. Stoumbos</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounders], the Court will determine whether allegations that major credit card companies agreed amongst themselves, as well as with banks, to charge customers a certain rate for ATM use are sufficient to plead elements of conspiracy under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-1">Sherman Anti-Trust Act</a> [text]. The DC Circuit Court, below, ruled that such allegations were sufficient to bring conspiracy charges under the Sherman Act, but other appellate courts have split on the matter.</p>

<p>The Court also combined the cases of <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bank-of-america-corp-v-city-of-miami/">Bank of America v. Miami</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/wells-fargo-co-v-city-of-miami/">Wells Fargo v. Miami</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], seeking to answer whether a city constitutes an &#8220;aggrieved person&#8221; under the <a href="http://www.fairhousingfirst.org/documents/fairhousingact.pdf">Fair Housing Act</a> [text, PDF], and is thus allowed to bring suit against mortgage lenders and housing operators for racial (and other) discrimination in housing. The Court will also examine questions of whether use of the term &#8220;aggrieved person&#8221; in FHA Article III implies a more stringent, &#8220;zone-of-interest&#8221; standard than a typical &#8220;injury-in-fact&#8221; analysis.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/czyzewski-v-jevic-holding-corporation/">Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the Court has been asked to decide whether the bankruptcy court may "dismiss a case that has been settled through an agreement that gives payment to lower-ranking creditors ahead of more senior-ranked creditors." The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Third Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/jevic-op-below.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in January of last year that, while unsatisfactory, payment of a settlement against the statutory priority scheme was justified where the alternative meant the "lawsuit [would] proceed to deplete the estate...serv[ing] the interests of neither the creditors nor the estate.</p>

<p>Finally, the federal government, in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lynch-v-morales-santana/">Lynch v. Morales-Santana</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] asks the Court to approve its heightened citizenship requirements for children born abroad, and out of wedlock, where their father is a U.S. citizen and their mother is not, against the Fifth Amendment equal protection guarantee. In 2013 the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruled against the government, holding that equal protection would not be satisfied unless 8 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401">1401</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1409">1409</a> [text] were struck, or one continuous presence standard was uniformly applied to individuals in both categories.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the for the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://files.eqcf.org/cases/314-cv-00818-52/">extended a permanent injunction</a> [order] prohibiting clerks in Mississippi from recusing themselves from issuing mariage licences to same-sex couples for religious reasons. <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-carlton-reeves">Judge Carlton Reeves</a> [official profile] prevented portions of <a href="http://index.ls.state.ms.us/isysnative/UzpcRG9jdW1lbnRzXDIwMTZccGRmXGhiXDE1MDAtMTU5OVxoYjE1MjNpbi5wZGY=/hb1523in.pdf">HB 1523</a> [text, PDF] dealing with grounds for recusal from going into effect. HB 1523 is a religious freedom law signed by <a href="http://www.governorbryant.com/">Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official website] and portions are set to take effect Friday. In explicitly extending an existing injunction against the Circuit Cllerk of Hinds County to all other counties in the state, Reeves held that notice must be provided to the remaining clerks of their obligation to treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples equally. </p>

<p>Last week Reeves <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-declines-to-block-mississippi-religious-freedom-law.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to block the bill in it's entirety and chose instead to hear challenges relating to the bill. Mississippi's governor signed this bill into law in April, just days after a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners. In November the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that same-sex divorce is <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/mississippi-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-divorce.php">legal</a> [JURIST report] within the state. In a 5-4 decision, the high court granted the divorce order citing to the recent US Supreme Court decision in <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">Obergefell v. Hodges</a> [JURIST report] as the main legal authority.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/homepage.html">Volkswagen AG</a> [corporate website] has agreed to spend up to $14.7 billion to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/enrd/pages/attachments/2016/06/28/vw_partial_2l_cd_and_appendices_docketed.pdf">settle</a> [consent decree, PDF] allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators announced Tuesday. The company will either to buy back or to terminate existing leases on model year 2009 to 2015 vehicles equipped with the company's 2.0 liter diesel and held by US consumers. Under this program the company is prepared to spend almost $10.03 billion compensating consumers. Furthermore, the company will spend over $4.7 billion to mitigate pollution from these cars in response to cheating emissions tests. The settlement comes after <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/809826/download">allegations</a> [complaint, PDF] from the <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/">California Attorney General</a>'s Office and the <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">California Air Resources Board</a> [official websites] relating to Volkswagen's use of devices meant to cheat emission tests by using illegal software to alter engine functions when testing equipment was present. The settlements also <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/162-3006/volkswagen-group-america-inc">resolve</a> [FTC proposed order] <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/160329volkswagen_cmpt.pdf">claims</a> [complaint, PDF] by the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] that Volkswagen's advertising of the affected vehicles as "clean diesel" and "low emission" was deceptive and unfair. In all, these settlements require Volkswagen to offer a buyback program and meet an 85% recall rate, provide EPA-approved modification to their vehicle emissions systems, fund Emission Reduction programs, finance improvements to Zero Emissions Technology, and provide injunctive relief and compensation to those who they deceived with their advertising practices. </p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. A law firm in Germany filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/volkswagen-facing-multi-billion-dollar-investor-lawsuit-in-germany.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last month against VW on behalf of investors alleging a breach of duty to the capital market. Last year the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/germany-prosecutor-investigating-former-vw-ceo.php">opened a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, following accusations that the company cheated on government emissions tests by manipulating exhaust valves. The investigation followed several criminal complaints, including one filed by VW, and came less than a week after Winterkorn stepped down as CEO of the company. In his statement he accepted "responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines" and said that he was "clearing the way for this fresh start with [his] resignation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two justices of the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] on Wednesday declined to rule on a petition challenging the constitutionality of the country's law prohibiting sex between consenting adults of the same sex. The petitioners, several prominent LGBT celebrities, had argued that their lives had been <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Section-377-CJI-to-decide-on-hearing-new-petition-by-celebrities/articleshow/52968480.cms">inexorably constricted and their rights infringed</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report] by <a href="http://www.lawyerscollective.org/vulnerable-communities/lgbt/section-377.html">Section 377</a> [advocacy materials] of the Indian Penal Code, which provides for punishment including life imprisonment for "carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal." Justices <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/sjud/sabobde.htm">Sharad Bobde</a> and Ashok Bhushan  deferred judgment on the petition and referred the case to <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/sjud/tsthakur.htm">Chief Justice T.S. Thakur</a> [official profiles] to determine whether a five member panel should consider the petition. Thakur is currently <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/india-high-court-to-review-decision-banning-gay-sex.php">considering</a> [JURIST report] a similar petition against Section 377 filed by the <a href="http://nazindia.org/">Naz Foundation</a> [advocacy website], who successfully challenged Section 377 in the landmark 2009 case <a href="http://icj2.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Naz-Foundation-v.-Government-of-NCT-of-Delhi-and-Others-The-High-Court-of-Delhi-at-New-Delhi-India.pdf">Naz Foundation v. Government of Dehli</a> [text, PDF] at the <a href="http://delhihighcourt.nic.in/">Delhi High Court</a> [official website]. The High Court's decision was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/12/india-supreme-court-reinstates-gay-sex-ban.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] and Section 377's constitutionality upheld by the Supreme Court in December 2013.</p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. Last December voters in Slovenia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. In September 2015, 12 UN agencies <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.mv/eng/index.php">Supreme Court of the Maldives</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.mv/mediafolder/2016-sc-a-01_pg_(mohamed_nasheed).pdf">upheld</a> [decision, in Dhivehi] the 13-year prison sentence of former <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Nasheed&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">President Mohamed Nasheed</a> [JURIST news archive] on terrorism-related charges. Nasheed was originally <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/former-maldives-president-sentenced-by-criminal-court.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015 after he was found guilty of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilaterally arresting</a> [JURIST report] then-Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges. Facing international pressure, the government appealed Nasheed's sentence, arguing that he was not afforded sufficient time to prepare a defense. Monday's ruling by the Supreme Court rejected that argument and upheld the sentence. Nasheed's <a href="http://mdp.org.mv/">Maldivian Democratic Party</a> (MDP) [party website] called the ruling <a href="http://mdp.org.mv/archives/72464">unsurprising</a> [press release] and emblematic of "democratic backsliding" in the country. Nasheed's sentence had been commuted to house arrest last July due to concerns for his health, but the original custodial sentence was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/08/former-maldives-president-sent-back-to-jail.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] a month later.</p>

<p>The Maldivian judiciary has generated significant controversy in recent years.

In October 2014, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-rights-office-condemns-maldives-prosecution-of-human-rights-commission-members.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the Supreme Court's prosecution of five members of the <a href="http://www.hrcm.org.mv/Homepage.aspx">Maldives Human Rights Commission</a> [official website]. In March 2014, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/maldives-supreme-court-sentences-election-commission.php">dismissed [</a>JURIST report] the country's four top election commissioners, giving each a six-month jail sentence and three-year suspension for "disobeying orders."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites] (HRW) issued a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/29/suspend-saudi-arabia-un-human-rights-council">joint statement</a> [text] on Wednesday calling for the removal of Saudia Arabia from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website]. The groups are urging the General Assembly to invoke a provision of <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N05/502/66/PDF/N0550266.pdf?OpenElement">Resolution 60/251</a> [text, PDF] allowing for suspension of membership in the HRC for states who have committed "gross and systematic violations of human rights." HRW and AI allege that Saudi Arabia has committed "systematic violations of human rights during its time as a Council member," including "numerous attacks [in Yemen] that have violated international humanitarian law, including indiscriminate and disproportionate airstrikes," which have resulted in significant civilian casualties. The statement comes after supposed failure by a national commission of inquiry to address human rights violation occurring in the on-going conflict. Both groups have also accused Saudi Arabia of threatening to withdraw funds from UN programs, in an attempt to remove the country from the "List of Shame" after killing and injuring children during attacks directed at schools and hospitals in Yemen.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. In March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-yemen-conflict-to-swallow-their-pride.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Saudi Arabian coalition forces in Yemen for the more than 3,000 civilian casualties resulting from the conflict in just the past year. Also in March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the civilian death toll in Yemen had reached nearly 2,800. In January the UN World Food Programme appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to allow the<a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php"> safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October Amnesty International <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into possible war crimes surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court of the United States</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062816zr_29m1.pdf">denied</a> [orders list, PDF] <em>certioriari</em> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/stormans-inc-v-wiesman/">Stormans Inc. v. Wiesman</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], a case challenging a Washington regulation requiring pharmacies to sell birth control despite potential religious objections of employees. The petitioners, a pharmacy and two pharmacists, challenged the applicability of rules promulgated by the <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/LicensesPermitsandCertificates/ProfessionsNewReneworUpdate/PharmacyCommission">Washington Pharmacy Quality Assurance Commission</a> [official website]  that require pharmacists to timely deliver prescribed medication, including so-called "Plan B" emergency contraceptives. The regulation allows a pharmacist who objects to Plan B on religious grounds to refuse to fill the prescription provided another, non-objecting employee is available to provide the medication. The petitioners objected to application of the rule under the free exercise clause of the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/constitutions/united_states.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text]. Last year, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [official website] found that the asserted rights <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Stormans-op.pdf">were not fundamental</a> [opinion, PDF], and thus that the regulations need only pass the "rational basis" test. With Tuesday's denial of <em>certioari</em>, the Supreme Court has declined to review the decision and the Ninth Circuit's ruling now controls the question. Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissent, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, saying that "those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern."</p>

<p>The debate over abortion law and women's right of access to contraceptives has gathered a lot of international attention in recent years. In an <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/02/04/letter-president-koroma-sierra-leone">open letter</a> [text] released in February, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites], along with five other advocacy groups, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/human-rights-groups-urge-sierra-leone-president-to-sign-abortion-bill.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sierra Leonean President <a href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sl/">Ernest Bai Koroma</a> [official website] to sign a bill that would increase women's access to safe and legal abortion. In December 2015, In November a <a href="https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2015/%5B2015%5D%20NIQB%2096/j_j_HOR9740Final.htm">ruled</a> [judgment] that Northern Ireland's abortion laws, which only allow abortion when the mother faces the risk of death or serious injury, is a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/northern-ireland-court-restrictive-abortion-laws-violate-human-rights.php">violation of human rights</a> [JURIST report]. Also in November, an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr29/2873/2015/en/">AI report</a> [press release] stated that woman who suffer miscarriages or complications in the course of their pregnancy can be charged with counts of abortion or even aggravated homicide, which <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-el-salvador-abortion-law-breeding-atmosphere-of-fear.php">breeds an "atmosphere of suspicion and fear"</a> [JURIST report] surrounding the pregnancy process. In June 2014 The US Supreme Court [official website] ruled [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that closely held for-profit <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/06/supreme-court-rules-closely-held-corporations-can-deny-contraceptive-coverage-for-religious-reasons---.php">corporations can deny coverage</a> [JURIST report] of contraception costs because of their religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Wednesday filed a <a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ACLU-CFAA-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging a provision in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA) [text] allowing for criminal prosecution based on access that "exceeds authorized use." The ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/sandvig-v-lynch-challenge-cfaa-prohibition-uncovering-racial-discrimination-online">contends</a> [advocacy materials] that the broad interpretation of the prohibition on unauthorized use to obtain "information from any protected computer" allows for criminal prosecution for violating a website's terms of service, which may prohibit "gathering or recording publicly available information, creating multiple accounts, or providing false information." The plaintiffs in the case, including academic researchers and a news organization, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/aclu-challenges-computer-crimes-law-thwarting-research-discrimination-online">argue</a> [press release] that the people "who want to use those methods for socially valuable research should not have to risk prosecution for using them"</p>

<p>The CFAA was enacted in 1986 to protect against federal computer hacking. Since then, the law has been used numerous times, including in the high-profile case against internet activist Aron Swartz. In April 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/appeals-court-rejects-broad-reading-of-computer-fraud-law.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a broad interpretation of the "authorized use" provision that would have extended liability to people who access unauthorized information while on a computer they were authorized to use. In 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/telecom-giant-sues-data-brokers-to.php">AT&#38;T filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against 25 people claiming they committed fraud by posing as potential customers to obtain information about other customers to be used in legal disputes. Courts have also attempted to use the law in cyber bullying cases. In 2009, a California appeals court <a href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/united-states-v-drew">overturned the conviction</a> [case materials] of Lori Drew who had been convicted of setting up a fake Myspace account for a 13 year old girl, who eventually committed suicide. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.juridat.be/appel/bruxelles/">Brussels Court of Appeals</a> [official website, in French] on Wednesday found that the Belgian courts do not have jurisdiction over Facebook's collection and processing of data from users in Belgium. The court noted that <a href="https://investor.fb.com/home/default.aspx">Facebook</a> [corporate website] is an American company that bases its European operations, including data processing for European and some North American customers, in Ireland. As such, the court <a href="http://www.lecho.be/entreprises/technologie/Facebook_remporte_sa_bataille_sur_la_vie_privee_en_Belgique.9783410-7774.art?ckc=1&ts=1467307970">found</a> [<em>L'Echo</em> report] that it had no jurisdiction over the processing of data collected by a foreign company in a foreign country. The <a href="https://www.privacycommission.be/en">Commission for the Protection of Privacy</a> (CPP) [official website] said Wednesday's ruling vacating a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/belgium-court-orders-facebook-to-stop-tracking-non-users.php">lower court order</a> [JURIST report] preventing Facebook from any tracking of users within the country who have not signed up for the social networking platform meant that Belgians were <a href="https://www.privacycommission.be/fr/news/la-cour-dappel-rejette-les-arguments-contre-facebook">unable to protect their private lives</a> [press release, in French] from foreign actors and would be exposed to massive violations of their privacy. The CPP also indicated that it is examining an appeal to Belgium's <a href="http://justice.belgium.be/fr/ordre_judiciaire/cours_et_tribunaux/cour_de_cassation">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French].  </p>

<p>Facebook has faced numerous legal challenges across the globe. In January Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&Datum=Aktuell&Sort=12288&nr=73328&linked=pm&Blank=1">ruled</a> [press release, in German] that Facebook's <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/germany-top-court-rules-facebook-friend-finder-tool-unlawful.php">friend finder feature is unlawful</a> [JURIST report]. In October the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies, including Facebook, is not sufficiently protected. In December 2014 Facebook <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/facebook-faces-lawsuit-alleging-violation-of-privacy.php">failed to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that claimed it scanned users' private messages for the names of websites for targeted advertising purposes. In May 2014 an Iranian judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/iran-judge-orders-facebook-ceo-to-appear-in-court.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear in court regarding allegation that certain Facebook apps violated user privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/">Iowa Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Griffin%20v%20Pate%20SC%20Ruling.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a state law forbidding convicted felons from voting, even after serving their sentences. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [official website] brought suit in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/griffin-v-pate?redirect=cases/griffin-v-branstad">Griffin v. Pate</a> [case file] on behalf of Kelli Jo Griffin, who was convicted of a non-violent drug offense, arguing that the "infamous crimes" standard used to restrict voting violates the Iowa Constitution. After reviewing the history of crimes of infamy in the state, the court upheld the provision and noted the potential for discriminatory impact.<blockquote>[W]e acknowledge that voter disqualification based on criminal convictions has a disproportionate impact on voting rights of African Americans and perhaps other groups in society. Yet this outcome is tied to our criminal justice system as a whole and is not isolated to the use of the infamous-crime standard. Racial disparity must be eliminated in society, but its unwanted presence does not necessarily undermine the concept or current definition of infamous crime as a standard for voter disqualification. Moreover, no evidence suggests this state adopted or maintained infamy to discriminate against minority groups.</blockquote> The suit comes after a change in administration switched the law from granting automatic restoration of a felon's voting rights to requiring them to undergo a rigorous application process.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org">Judicial Watch</a> [advocacy website] filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/virginia-felon-voting-rights-challenged.php">restoring the voting rights of certain felons</a> [JURIST report]. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">is constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">provide proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In April a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">federal judge upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">pass a bill that will allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a unanimous ruling on Thursday, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/home.html">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ea03c742-1519-4a07-a9d3-818cdf43e7de/1/doc/12-4671_complete_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/ea03c742-1519-4a07-a9d3-818cdf43e7de/1/hilite/">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] a settlement agreement between retailers and credit card issuers. Millions of retailers had reached a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/business/mastercard-visa-settlement-with-retailers-is-overturned.html?_r=0">$7.25 billion antitrust settlement</a> [NYT report] with <a href="https://usa.visa.com/">Visa USA</a> and <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/global/">MasterCard International</a> [corporate websites] in 2013. However, after determining that some of the merchants covered by the pact were inadequately represented, the Second Circuit found that the agreement violated Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23(a)(4)</a> and the Due Process Clause of the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/constitutions/united_states.php#amendment_xiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. The case was filed as an antitrust class action by approximately 12 million merchants in 2006 against Visa, Mastercard, and various issuing and acquiring banks alleging conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=51&page=transcript">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> [text]. The dispute mainly arose over the interchange fee, which is ultimately paid by retailers and other merchants to the issuers and banks. Among other deficiencies noted by the court, one class of merchants was eligible to receive money damages, while the other could only receive injunctive relief. There was also an opt-out provision, specifically reserved only for a particular class of merchants. Stating that the Due Process Clause requires the named plaintiff to "adequately represent the interests of all absent class members at all times," the court stated that the settlement failed to meet this requirement and the procedural requirements of FRCP 23(a)(4) and rejected the settlement as unreasonable and inadequate.</p>

<p>There have been several high-profile cases involving credit card companies in the last several years.  In April 2014, Judge William Pauley of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/district-court-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-credit-card-issuers.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit against <a href="http://ir.americanexpress.com">American Express</a>, <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi">Citigroup</a> and <a href="https://www.discover.com">Discover Financial Services</a> [corporate websites] that alleged the three credit card issuers violated the Sherman Act by colluding to require that all disputes be settled in arbitration. The plaintiffs in the case were seeking injunctive relief to prohibit these credit card issuers from putting such arbitration clauses in their agreements. In August 2014, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-approves-590-million-citigroup-investor-lawsuit.php#.U0gSOMfTavM">settlement</a> [JURIST report] in which Citigroup will pay its investors over $590 million for misrepresenting its assets in securities linked to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sub-prime">sub-prime mortgage crisis</a> [JURIST news archive]. In June 2014, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-upholds-contractual-waiver-of-class-arbitration.php#.U0gRJ8fTavM">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9#">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff's cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. </p>]]></content:encoded>
