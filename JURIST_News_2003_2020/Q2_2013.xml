Lawmakers are expected to announce the new immigration reforms when Congress <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/31/usa-immigration-idUSL2N0CN0EG20130331">reconvenes</a> [Reuters report] next week. There is no final legislative agreement, but lawmakers expect to draft language to include in a new law once the substance is reviewed by the group of eight senators on the bipartisan commission for immigration reform. The <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> and the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/">AFL-CIO</a> [websites] reached an agreement on Friday regarding the guest worker program for immigration reform, allowing the bipartisan commission to proceed with drafting the language for this reform. The bill will provide a way for 11 million undocumented immigrants to become US citizens.

<p>Immigration reform has been a recent focus for the US government. In February a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] draft immigration reform proposal that would allow immigrants to become <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/white-house-immigration-reform-draft-would-create-new-path-to-citizenship-report.php">legal permanent residents</a> [JURIST report] in eight years was revealed. The plan reportedly would also increase security funding, require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years, and create a new "Lawful Prospective Immigrant" visa program. If approved for the new visa, immigrants could also apply for the same status for spouses and children who live outside the US. Approved immigrants would be allowed to reside legally in the US for four years, to obtain work and to leave the country for brief time periods. In January a bipartisan group of eight senators, including <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/">Marco Rubio</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-senators-unveil-immigration-reform-plan.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/_files/_pdfs/Framework%20For%20Immigration%20Reform.pdf">framework</a> [text, PDF] of comprehensive immigration reform legislation that they plan to introduce by March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The president made these <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/04/201341124357441209.html">statements</a> [Al Jazeera report] after implementing a peace agreement with South Sudan. The rebel <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?mot147">Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North</a> (SPLM-N) [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> backgrounder] had been demanding a prisoner release after nearly two years of fighting government forces in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. Al-Bashir's regime has long rejected negotiations with insurgents, but <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/+-Ali-Uthman-Muhammad-Taha,486-+">Vice President Ali Osman Taha</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> profile] reached out last week to the SPLM-N and opposition political parties, inviting them to join a constitutional dialogue. Sudan is in need of a new constitution to replace the <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/sudan-constitution-talks-get-under-way.php">2005 document</a> based on a <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/signing-of-sudan-peace-agreement-ends.php">peace agreement</a> that ended a 23 year civil war and led to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">South Sudan's separation</a> [JURIST reports] in July 2011. 

<p>Tension in Sudan and South Sudan has remained extremely high following the split, and Sudan has a history of human rights issues. In February the UN urged Sudan security forces to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-sudan-security-forces-to-strengthen-human-rights-efforts.php">strengthen human rights efforts</a> [JURIST report] and expressed concern regarding the arrest and detention of political opposition figures. In January <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end its crackdown against political and cultural groups. Al-Bashir has also remained an extremely controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In June 2011 then-ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said that al-Bashir has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] in Darfur. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] charged him with <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">three counts of genocide</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010, but he has yet to be arrested. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to media sources, <a href="http://www.ajc.com/ap/ap/top-news/yemenis-demand-release-of-guantanamo-detainees/nW8Q3/">90 out the 166 remaining Guantanamo detainees are Yemeni</a> [AP report], and several have been detained for more than a decade. Protesters reportedly decried conditions at the prison, citing reports of inhumane treatment, water deprivation and forced feeding. Protesters also held up photos of their detained relatives and denounced treatment allegedly leading to several suicides, including that of Salah Al-Salami, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rumsfeld-sued-for-wrongful-death-of.php">committed suicide while in detention</a> [JURIST report] in 2006. The protest prompted dispatch of the Yemeni military. Among the Yemeni detainees is <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abd+al-Rahim+al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive], who  is accused of bombing the USS Cole while it was in port in Yemen in October 2000.

<p>Detention at Guantanamo Bay remains a controversial subject worldwide. Last month human rights lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-human-rights-attorneys-on.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that guards have denied drinking water and sufficient clothing to Yemeni prisoner Musa'ab Omar al-Madhwani. Also in March the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and defense lawyers for terrorism detainees held at Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Rear Admiral John Smith Jr. describing harsh conditions faced by the detainees and indicated that the detainees have begun to protest the conditions via hunger strike. The lawyers learned of these practices and protests after being <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">permitted to visit</a> [JURIST report] the detention center in February, though Guantanamo has long been the subject of various controversies during the <a href="/currentawareness/terrorism.php">Global War on Terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Amnesty International (AI) contends that 32-year-old al-Madhwani has been <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,AMNESTY,,USA,509787bb2,0.html">held without cause at Guantanamo Bay</a> [AI report] for more than a decade, where he was sent shortly following his arrest by Pakistani security forces on September 11, 2002. In May 2011 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed a lower court's decision confirming that al-Madhwani was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-denies-habeas-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">lawfully detained</a> [JURIST report] for being part of al Qaeda.

The court reasoned that subject product "beta crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate (the ingredient in Glivec), fails in both the tests of invention and patentability" and thus, appellant's appeal would merely be an attempt to obtain patent for Imatinib Mesylate which is prohibited under India patent law. In a <a href="http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2013/1689290.shtml">press release</a> [text], Novartis condemned the Supreme Court's decision stating that the holding, "discourages innovative drug discovery essential to advancing medical science for patients." According to the statement Novartis has been granted patent protection for their new Glivec formula in nearly 40 countries including, Russia and China. The Swiss pharmaceutical company had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/us-india-novartis-patent-idUSBRE93002I20130401">challenged</a> [Reuters report] Indian patent law that denies patents for newer versions of pre-existing medications. According to Reuters, two Indian companies already produce and sell generic versions of Glivec in the country at one-tenth the cost.   

<p>The decision in this case is expected to have a major impact on pharmaceutical patent cases in India. <a href="http://www.msfaccess.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.msfaccess.org/about-us/media-room/press-releases/indian-supreme-court-delivers-verdict-novartis-case">hailed the decision</a> [press release] as "a major victory for patients' access to affordable medicines in developing countries." Novartis' case is the most recent in a long line of pharmaceutical patent disputes between western drug companies and India. In March an Indian patent appeals board <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/04/us-india-bayer-idUSBRE9230LC20130304">upheld a decision</a> [Reuters report] to allow a domestic company to produce a generic version of the <a href="http://www.bayer.com/">Bayer AG</a> [corporate website] cancer drug Nexavar. Last year, India <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444223104578038111744300822.html">revoked patents</a> [WSJ report] for <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/home/">Pfizer Inc's</a> cancer drug Sutent and <a href="http://www.roche.com/index.htm">Roche Holding AG's</a> [corporate websites] hepatitis C drug Pegasys. Both companies have appealed the decisions. Issues around patents on pharmaceutical products are not limited to India.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The attacks were the result of ongoing clashes between Muslims and majority Buddhists in Meiktila. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/HRW_Meiktila_Damages_Presser_2013.03.pdf">analyzed satellite images</a> [report, PDF] which reveal the scale of destruction, including the total destruction of around 828 buildings and the majority of residences.

HRW Asia Director Brian Adams said: "Burma's government should have learned the lessons of recent sectarian clashes in Arakan State and moved quickly to bolster the capacity of the police to contain violence and protect lives and property." HRW said that government action is necessary to ending the "tide of attacks" among religious groups.

<p>The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/index.htm">UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar</a> [official website], Tomas Ojea Quintana, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">expressed serious concerns</a> [JURIST report] in a report on Thursday over growing violence between Muslim and Buddhist communities in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that government inaction has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country. In March Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-expert-urges-myanmar-to-address-remaining-issues.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the country of the possibility that the current reformation process may be endangered by leaving areas of importance untouched, especially related to the states of Rakhine and Kachin.

The three men, a Saudi national, a Pakistani national and a stateless <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kuwait-criticized-for-treatment-of-bidun-minority.php">Bidun</a> [JURIST report] man, were convicted on separate murder charges before being hanged outside the Central Prison on Monday. This marks the first execution in Kuwait since 2007 when a Pakistani man was executed on drug charges. AI has sternly opposed the use of the death penalty in all cases. Ann Harrison, AI's Deputy Programme Director for the Middle East and North Africa, stated that "[i]n a region where executions are sadly all too commonplace, Kuwait marked a beacon of hope by declining to execute people for almost six years. That hope has been extinguished today. We deplore this resumption of executions, regardless of the crime." Official photographs were taken and journalists were invited to witness the executions. Kuwait currently has 44 people on death row. According to AI, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq account for 99 percent of the reported executions in the region.

<p>The high execution rate in the Middle East and North African region has remained under international scrutiny. In March Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-legislature-approves-bill-banning-death-penalty.php">abolished death penalty</a> [JURIST report] within its borders in a 82-56 vote. A month earlier, the UN SG <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-chief-calls-for-abolition-of-death-penalty.php">reiterated</a> his call for global support against the use of death penalty. Also that month, two UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-death-sentence-imposed-in-bangladesh.php">expressed concern</a> over the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-member-to-death.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST reports] imposed by the International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh (ICBT) on Abdul Kalam Azad for crimes during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The experts argued that the trial failed to provide for guarantees of a fair trial and due process. In March AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE23/011/2013/en/60520fc4-9fa2-4a26-bc18-dc99962978ef/mde230112013en.pdf">reported</a> [PDF, press release] that seven men, two of which are thought to be juveniles, were publicly executed in Saudi Arabia.

In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/No.-12-__-Pet-App-Ok-to-Print-Locke-Lord-LLP.pdf.pdf">Atlantic Marine Construction Co. v. United States District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [cert. petition, PDF; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-929.htm">docket</a>] the court will consider whether its decision in <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=487+U.S.+22&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=3788072370221202936&scilh=0">Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.</a> [opinion] changed the standard for enforcement of clauses that designate an alternative federal forum, limiting review of such clauses to a discretionary, balancing-of-conveniences analysis under <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1404">28 USC &#167; 1404(a)</a> [text] and whether district courts should allocate the burdens of proof among parties seeking to enforce or to avoid a forum-selection clause. In the case, <A href = "http://www.amccinc.com/">Atlantic Marine Construction</a> [corporate website] contracted with J-Crew Management, Inc. on a construction project in Texas, providing a forum-selection clause in their agreement that disputes "shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division." The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22701+F.3d+736%22&hl=en&num=1&as_sdt=2003&case=3133606312639426114&scilh=0">ruled</a> [opinion] that the forum selection clause in the contract was proper, although advised the parties to petition for <em>certiorari</em> due to the murkiness of the issue. "Absent some compelling countervailing factor (something J-Crew does not even argue is present here), forum-selection clauses such as this one should be and should have been enforced by transfer or dismissal." 

<p>The court also issued a <em>per curiam</em> <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-382_4h25.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] granting a summary reversal of a US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=10-55816&hl=en&num=1&as_sdt=2003&case=18218494814769581211&scilh=0">decision</a> [opinion]. In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-382.htm">Marshall v. Rodgers</a> [docket], a defendant represented himself for most of his hearings on felony charges and then requested appointment of counsel to draft a motion after the trial. The California Court of Appeal "concluded that his history of vacillating between counseled and self-representation, the lack of support for his motion, his demonstrated competence in defending his case, and his insistence that he 'c[ould] do the motion [him]self' but 'just need[ed] time to perfect it,' justified the trial court's denial of his post-trial request for counsel." The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found this violated the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] right to counsel. The Supreme Court's opinion refuted this, and stated that the Ninth Circuit made a ruling out of its own precedents, but not clearly established Federal law:<blockquote>It is unnecessary for present purposes to judge the merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for post waiver requests of appointment of counsel. All this case requires&#8212;and all the Court of Appeals was empowered to do under &#167;2254(d)(1)&#8212;is to observe that, in light of the tension between the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of "the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,"and its concurrent promise of "a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when [a criminal defendant] voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so," it cannot be said that California's approach is contrary to or an unreasonable application of the "general standard[s]" established by the Court's assistance-of-counsel cases.</blockquote>The court did not foreclose the possibility of hearing a similar case on the merits in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

We can't thank you enough for the donations, support, and feedback we've received over the past month. It is heartening to know that so many of our readers value JURIST!

<p>If you were unable to contribute financially this time around, fear not. First, I'd like to invite everyone to <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/testimonials.php">share your JURIST experiences</a> by sending an email to <a href="mailto:testimonials@jurist.org">testimonials@jurist.org</a>. Tell us what you get from reading JURIST, what makes JURIST unique, and why you think we should keep doing what we do. Be sure to include your name and your location. If you've got no objections, we'll share your thoughts with your fellow JURIST fans! </p>

<p>Second, to crib a famous catchphrase, we'll be back. As we're coming into our own as an independent non-profit, we will occasionally be asking for your support again. While we may not relish the idea of interrupting your access to news and commentary, reader support is the best way to keep JURIST free of advertisements and registration.</p>

<p>Third, we are happy to <a href="http://jurist.org/supportjurist/donate-now.php">accept donations</a> at any time, not just during fundraising drives. So, keep JURIST in mind if you win the lottery, sell your startup, or inherit a sizable fortune from a long-lost relative. We accept donations year round!</p>

<p>Once again, thank you for your show of support over the last month. While we ended up short of our goal for the drive, we appreciate our readers doing their part to keep JURIST chugging along. </p>

<p>And with that, I'm happy to say, we return you to your regularly-scheduled programming.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, BP <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-bp-spill-appeal-idUSBRE92E12Y20130315">appealed</a> [Reuters report] the court's earlier ruling upholding the way the compensation was being paid to business claimants wanting recompense. BP claims that administrator Patrick Juneau's methods give him too much leeway to make "absurd" payments for inflated or fictitious claims. Lawyers for Juneau <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/us-bp-spill-payouts-idUSBRE9300IT20130401">assert</a> [Reuters report] that his decisions regarding the payouts should have judicial immunity, claiming this immunity encourages "principled and fearless decision making" without the threat of interference from unhappy litigants. Even if Juneau were not entitled to immunity, Juneau's attorneys say that he has performed his official functions as claims administrator exactly as outlined in the settlement agreement. 

<p>Juneau's request comes as the court prepares to resume the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bp-gulf-oil-spill-trial-opens.php">non-jury trial to determine liability</a> [JURIST report] for the April 20, 2010, rupture of the Macondo well and explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">accepted a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] for the company's criminal liability in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Earlier in January, <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Ltd.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [EPA summary] and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. In December a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] BP to share partial liability with Transocean in oil spill claims in January 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill provides that if a county clerk is unable to verify the voter's registration, then the voter may vote a provisional ballot that would only be counted upon verification the individual's voter status, and that the Secretary of State must provide voter ID cards at no cost to individuals upon request.

ReDigi's online service allowed customers to use its platform to buy and sell "used" digital music originally purchased from <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Inc.'s</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> [official website] service. Judge Richard Sullivan had in February <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2012/02/redigiruling1.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF] an initial injunction request by Capitol to shut down ReDigi. In his decision, released Monday, however, he held that the case was distinguishable from the recent Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf">Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &#38; Sons Inc.</a> [text, PDF] and found that ReDigi, as a purveyor of digital products, was not protected from infringement liability by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109">first sale doctrine</a> [17 USC &#167; 109(a)]. The doctrine usually allows for the resale of copyrighted materials that have already been put in the market by creators or publishers. In refusing to apply it to this situation, Sullivan stated that, "here, the Court cannot of its own accord condone the wholesale application of the first sale defense to the digital sphere, particularly when Congress itself has declined to take that step." The court granted both Capitol's injunction against ReDigi and attorney's fees.

<p>Music piracy and copyright infringement have been controversial issues in recent years. In September the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-damage-award-in-file-sharing-lawsuit.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] a $220,000 jury verdict in a music file-sharing case against Jamie Thomas-Rasset for downloading 24 copyrighted songs. That case went through a long appeals process, as the award had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-reduces-15-million-jury-verdict-in-music-file-sharing-case.php">reduced to $54,000 from $1.9 million</a> [JURIST report] in 2011. The Supreme Court has since declined to rule on the case. In 2008, following much controversy between the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php?content_selector=about-who-we-are-riaa">Recording Industry Association of America </a>(RIAA) [official website] and Internet websites, the RIAA stated that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue its policy</a> [JURIST report] of suing suspected file-sharers and instead would seek cooperation with major Internet service providers to cut off access to repeat offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Sidney Stein <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/452512/20130402/citigroup-sidney-stein-bondholder-settlement-lawsuit-toxic.htm">requested</a> [IBTimes report] that Citigroup and its shareholders, the bank's opponents in this case, revisit the elements of the settlement, raising concerns over the reasonableness of legal fees and expenses, as well as the method of allocating the settlement funds. Specifically, the judge asked for more information on legal costs in light of the fact that <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/uk-citigroup-settlement-idUKBRE9300MI20130401">attorneys' fees amounted to $97.4 million</a> [Reuters report], approximately 16.5 percent of the settlement amount, and expenses reached $2.8 million. Stein made this request just days before a fairness hearing scheduled for April 8, in which he will decide whether to sign off on the settlement agreement. 

<p>Citigroup's shareholders <a href="http://securities.stanford.edu/1038/C_01/2008819_r01k_0709901.pdf">filed</a> [docket, PDF] this class action suit against the investment bank in 2007, in which they accuse it of making false or misleading statements regarding tens of billions of dollars of toxic mortgage assets. Citigroup filed a motion to dismiss in 2011 upon removal of the action to federal court, but Stein <a href="http://clients.oakbridgeins.com/clients/blog/citierisa111411.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] it. In the same month, Judge Jed Rakoff, sitting on the same court as Stein, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-citigroup-sec-settlement.php">blocked a proposal</a> [JURIST report] by Citigroup to settle with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] for $285 million in another case because he said the SEC failed to set forth any facts as to what Citigroup did that was against the public interest, a decision <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/2011-265-notice.pdf">appealed</a> [notice of appeal, PDF] by the SEC. Rakoff had also <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rejects-sec-citigroup-subprime-mortgage-settlement.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Citigroup's initial settlement agreement of $75 million with the SEC a year earlier. Some critics have <a href="/sidebar/2012/01/bondi-fischer-sec-citigroup.php">cautioned against the growing practice</a> [JURIST op-ed] of judicial settlement blocking, warning that if defendants force the SEC to prove its allegations at trial as opposed to attempted settlement, the SEC might become more selective in bringing enforcement actions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The countries claim that 13 months ago when Google merged 60 separate privacy policies, including email, video, social-networking and additional services, that Google failed to inform customers about how much information the company has about them and how long the information is kept. In 2012, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/">European Commission Article 29 Data Protection</a> [official website] Working Party reported that Google's privacy policy did not meet the Commission's data protection standards. Google was then given a four-month timeline to meet the recommendations required to bring the policy into line with European law. Google has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-02-28/google-to-appear-before-eu-data-watchdogs-over-privacy-concerns">commented that its privacy policy</a> [Bloomberg News] "respects European law and allows [it] to create simpler, more effective services."

<p>Google has faced various privacy lawsuits recently. Earlier this month Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">agreed to settle a $7 million</a> [JURIST report] settlement for its collection of improper data during its Street View campaign. Last December an Italian appeals court overturned the conviction of three Google executives for <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">violating Italian privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by posting a video on Google of a handicapped child being bullied. Last November a judge in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] approved the $22.5 million fine levied by the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> [official website] against Google for itss <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php">alleged privacy misrepresentations</a> [JURIST report] concerning Apple's Safari internet browser.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the new law, Putin will have the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-04-02/putin-approves-law-allowing-regions-to-abolish-direct-elections">ability to submit three candidates</a> [Bloomberg News report] to legislature for approval for any of the country's 83 regions. This structure can be used to circumvent direct elections. While Putin and the legislature maintain that the law is necessary to prevent unrest and protect the rights of minorities, the law has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/02/us-russia-elections-idUSBRE9310GR20130402">criticized as a setback for democracy</a> [Reuters report] and a method of promoting Putin's United Russia Party. Putin abolished popular election of governors in 2004, but that rule was reversed last year amid widespread <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18405306">protests</a> [BBC report] in Russia. 

<p>The new election law is merely the latest in a string of controversial laws enacted in Russia recently. In January, it was announced that Russia would <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-delays-enforcement-of-us-adoption-ban-law.php">delay enforcement</a> of a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">law that would prohibit adoption</a> [JURIST reports] to the US. Also in January, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/putin-signs-new-education-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] new education legislation which, among other things, requires courses that teach the fundamentals of religion. In November, a law which gives Russian authorities significant latitude to regulate the internet <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report]. In July of last year, Putin <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that labels all non-governmental organizations that engage in political activities  as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry before receiving any foreign funding. That same month, Russian politicians <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-politicians-ask-constitutional-court-to-review-protest-legislation.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the country's constitutional court to review a law that increases penalties against protestors who violate regulations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The treaty, which regulates trade of conventional weapons, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-approves-global-arms-treaty/2013/04/02/66867b2e-9bb7-11e2-9bda-edd1a7fb557d_story.html">passed</a> [Washington Post Report] with 154 member states voting in favor of the treaty. Only 3 states voted against the treaty on the basis that it is too restrictive of the self-defense interests of smaller countries. Twenty-three countries abstained from voting, including Russia and China. The treaty prohibits states from exporting conventional weapons to governments in violation of UN arms embargos, and from exporting conventional weapons which may be used in genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or terrorism. It also requires that states prevent conventional weapons from reaching the black market. The treaty does not control the use of domestic weapons. Restrictions on ammunition were considered, but the US struck down the idea. The treaty was praised by arms-control advocates, but critics fear that the treaty <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/02/un-general-assembly-passes-arms-treaty">will be ineffective</a> [Guardian report] because countries that are large arms dealers, including the US, UK, France and Russia, are given an unfair advantage. The <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] has pledged to fight ratification of the treaty on the basis that it will weaken Second Amendment gun rights in the US. The treaty will take effect 90 days after 50 countries <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/un-adopts-arms-treaty-global-weapons-trade_n_2999505.html">ratify it</a> [Huffington Post report].    

<p>The UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-votes-to-negotiate-international-arms-treaty.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to re-enter negotiations over an international arms treaty in December. Previous negotiations had fallen apart, and many blamed the political climate in the US and the substantial pressure from the NRA to veto any international arms treaty. In July, the UN had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/deadline-for-un-arms-treaty-passes-without-consensus.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the deadline for an arms treaty to pass without reaching a consensus.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Simbikangawa was <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130402/france-orders-first-trial-rwandan-genocide">arrested</a> [AFP report] pursuant to an international arrest warrant. He was the head of Central Intelligence under the Hutu Rwandan government during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder] that killed an estimated 800,000 people.

Sumbikangawa has been held by the French government sine 2009.

<p>Courts in many parts of the world have attempted to try those responsible for the genocide.

Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. Also in December, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-extends-terms-of-rwanda-criminal-tribunal-justices.php">unanimously adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to extend the term of office of five judges of the ICTR.

The court <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/343782/constitution-court-won-t-stop-parliament">refused to grant an injunction</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] on the existing petitions before parliament, as the senator who brought the challenge was seeking. The key provision before parliament would change <a href="http://www.samuiforsale.com/law-texts/thai-law-translations-constitution-of-thailand.html#15">Article 68</a> [text] of Thailand's constitution to prevent individuals from directly petitioning the high court and would instead need to go through the attorney general. Because the court did not grant the injunction on the vote, it will be held Wednesday night. In the meantime, senators have been given 15 days to respond to Senator Somchai Sawaengkarn's petition against the amendment process. The court's ruling is expected to follow. Supporters of the process claim it is essential for the separation of powers. Opponents claim the court merely accepting Sawaengkarn's petition overstepped their power. 

<p>Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's Puea Thai party is attempting to amend the constitution which was drafted by a military-appointed government after the 2006 coup which forced her brother, former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+Shinawatra">news archive</a>] into exile. Last July the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/thailand-court-rules-on-constituional-amendment-case.php">dismissed opposition party petitions</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Puea Thai party's ability to amend the country's constitution. The court ruled that the parliament could amend the constitution on a piecemeal basis by amending separate articles, but that a national referendum would be required to rewrite the entire charter. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] was passed in the Alabama <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Senate</a> [official website] by a <a href="http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/04/house_approves_change_to_abort.html">22-10 vote</a> [AL.com report] after having been <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-tightening-regulation-of-abortion-clinics.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the state's <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/house.html">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in February by a 73-23 margin. The legislation imposes new restrictions on abortion providers such as the requiring the practitioner to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and the clinic facilities to meet certain design criteria which require minimum widths of corridors and sinks. Supporters of the Women's Health and Safety Act say the act is intended to require that abortion clinics meet the same health standards as hospitals, thus better securing safety for women who choose to undergo an abortion. Critics of the act claim the measure will effectively close many abortion clinics in Alabama. The bill now goes to Republican <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] for final approval. Also on Tuesday, the Indiana House of Representatives <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/indiana-house-passes-bill-regulating-druginduced-abortions-47490/">passed</a> [Indiana Public Media report] <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2013/PDF/ES/ES0371.1.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] which would require that clinics which offer the drug commonly called the "abortion pill" or "RU486" must also meet certain design and equipment standards as clinics which provide surgical abortions.

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Last month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hungary is estimated to currently have 30,000 homeless individuals. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/SRExtremePovertyIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights</a> Magdalena Sepulveda and the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/HousingIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on adequate housing</a> [official websites] Raquel Rolnik stated that the amendment was an attempt to circumvent a ruling by the Hungarian Constitutional Court last year to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12881&LangID=E">decriminalize homelessness</a> [press release]. Rolnik stated that there are not currently enough homeless shelters in the country to handle the number of homeless people and that the amendment "is contrary to Hungary's international human rights obligations of equality and non-discrimination." Sepulveda said that the previous legislation, which was overturned by the Constitutional Court, resulted in more than USD $125,000 fines against Hungarian homeless people.

<p>The Hungarian Constitutional Court has recently had a contentious relationship with the Hungarian Parliament. Last month the Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-controversial-constitutional-amendments.php">approved several constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] that had previously been struck down by the country's Constitutional Court. In February Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hungary-constitutional-court-strikes-down-church-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that outlines how churches are given official designation, finding that it was too political. In January the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hungary-top-court-declares-new-electoral-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down an electoral law</a> [JURIST report] requiring voters to register to vote at least two weeks before elections in 2014.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsudan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A group of US policymakers and advocates on Wednesday <a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/reports/architects-atrocity-sudanese-governments-war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity-and-torture">alleged in a new report</a> [press release] that Sudan's government has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture near the border of South Sudan since June 2011. Titled <a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/files/Architects_of_Atrocity.pdf"><em>Architects of Atrocity</em></a> [text, PDF], the report was released by the <a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/">Enough Project</a>, a group committed to ending genocide and crimes against humanity, and the <a href="http://www.satsentinel.org/">Satellite Sentinel Project</a> (SSP) [advocacy websites], who, over the course of nearly two years, used ground research and satellite imagery from <a href="http://combination.digitalglobe.com/">DigitalGlobe</a> [corporate website] to gather information that may serve as evidence of the government's potential violations of international law in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. In particular, the report alleges that the government intentionally burned, bombed and looted civilian villages as part of the ongoing fight with the <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?mot147">Sudan People's Liberation Army-North</a> (SPLA-N) [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> backgrounder], and that officials are also responsible for torturing and killing civilians. The Enough Project contends that this ongoing fight between the Sudanese government and the SPLA-N constitutes a non-international armed conflict, thus obligating the government to abide by well-established law under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II</a> [ICRC materials], which sets out the rules for non-international armed conflicts, and the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/genocide.html">UN Convention on Genocide</a> [text]. The group bolstered its claims by also asserting that international custom established under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] similarly bind Sudan, and thus the government should be held accountable. In addition to referring the situation in Sudan to the ICC, the group also asked the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] to establish an impartial commission of inquiry to carry out its own investigation into war crimes, crimes against humanity, and torture in the two states.

<p>Tension in Sudan and South Sudan has remained high since the end of of a 23-year civil war that led to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">South Sudan's separation</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011, and the Sudanese government has consistently endured human rights criticisms. In response to lengthy negotiations, Sudanese <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16010445">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile] this week said that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/sudan-to-release-all-political-detainees.php">release all political detainees</a> [JURIST report] and renew a commitment to maintain an open dialogue with South Sudan. In February, the UN urged Sudan security forces to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-sudan-security-forces-to-strengthen-human-rights-efforts.php">strengthen human rights efforts</a> [JURIST report] and expressed concern regarding the arrest and detention of political opposition figures. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-calls-on-sudan-to-end-crackdown-on-political-groups.php">urged Sudan</a> [JURIST report] to end its crackdown against political and cultural groups. Al-Bashir similarly remains a controversial figure in international politics for his actions during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In June 2011, then-ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said that al-Bashir has continued to commit crimes against humanity [JURIST report] in Darfur. Although the ICC charged him with <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">three counts of genocide</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010, al-Bashir still has yet to be arrested. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Barahira was <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=15316&a=65598">arrested</a> [<em>New Times</em> report] pursuant to an arrest warrant issued in Rwanda, in the French city of Toulouse. Barahira was leader of Commune Kabarondo, and is alleged to be connected to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder] that killed an estimated 800,000 people. It is unclear whether the French will extradite Barahira. To date, French government has refused to extradite prisoners to Rwanda, fearing they will not receive a fair trial. This move follows closely behind a French court's decision this week to order Pascal Simbikangwa, a former Rwandan Army Captain, to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-court-orders-trial-for-rwanda-genocide-suspect.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity committed during the genocide.

<p>Courts in many parts of the world have attempted to try those responsible for the Rwandan genocide. In January, Rwandan genocide suspect Innocent Musabyimana was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in France on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In December, the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-former-minister-in-final-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan minister <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=7&mnid=2">Augustin Ngirabatware</a> [case materials], sentencing him to 35 years in prison and concluding the tribunal's final trial. Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. Also in December, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-extends-terms-of-rwanda-criminal-tribunal-justices.php">unanimously adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to extend the term of office of five judges of the ICTR. Since its founding in 1994 following the Rwandan genocide, the ICTR has indicted 91 individuals and, thus far, finished 50 trials with 29 convictions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires that in order to qualify for these lowered rates, students must have attended high school in Oregon for at least three years, must have attended school in the US for at least five years, and must show proof of intent to become a US citizen. The subsidized tuition rate will save undocumented immigrants an estimated $20,000 per year, though they will still be ineligible to apply for state and federal financial aid. The bill will go into effect in July.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have became a hot button issue over the past few years when many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving their state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Last month, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-blocks-key-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">permanently blocked</a> [JURIST report] a key provision in Georgia's immigration law that criminalized knowingly transporting or harboring an undocumented immigrant during the course of any other crime. In January, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/alabama-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to overturn a recent decision striking down provisions of Alabama's controversial <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law </a>[HB 56, PDF]. In December Thrash lifted a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-on-part-of-georgia-immigration-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking part of a Georgia immigration law that allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. Thrash's order was in line with an August ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] that provision of the law, but it remains to be seen how police will enforce the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This was Lutsenko's last opportunity at an appeal in national courts, leaving an appeal to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] as his final option. Similar to the case against Tymoshenko, this case has been looked upon suspiciously by the European Union as an attempt by current <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovich</a> [official website] to contain his opposition.

<p>The trials of Tymoshenko and her supporters have been the subject of much controversy recently. In February Tymoshenko was fined USD $2,000 for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jailed-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-fined-for-contempt.php">contempt</a> [JURIST report] of court after a hearing in Kiev. In January the state <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/lawyer-for-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-under-criminal-investigation.php">began investigating</a> [JURIST report] her lawyer for several criminal charges. Tymoshenko has already been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced to seven years</a> in prison on corruption charges and is currently awaiting trial on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">tax evasion</a> [JURIST reports]. In September the <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov/">US Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. Last July, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/europe-rights-court-rules-ukraine-officials-detention-was-arbitrary.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that the arrest and detention of Lutsenko violated the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/CONVENTION_ENG_WEB.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state law characterizes same-sex intercourse as a "crime against nature," and violation of the law carries a possible five-year prison sentence. The lawsuit was filed in the <a href="http://www.nvd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nevada</a> [official website] on behalf of an anonymous plaintiff who was arrested last year on juvenile felony allegations under the controversial law. The complaint asks the court to find the law unconstitutional and issue a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the law. 

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain controversial throughout the US.

A 2012 report from the National Commission of Inquiry found both pro-Gbagbo and pro-Ouattara forces responsible for serious international crimes. However, of the 150 individuals arrested and charged, none was of the pro-Ouattara forces. HRW urged Ouattara to fulfill his "repeated promises that all of those involved in serious crimes&#8212;regardless of political affiliation or military rank&#8212;will be brought to justice ... [because] the costs of ignoring justice, despite the real challenges that exist, is too high." While the Ivorian government has increased the national budget amount allocated to the justice sector from 2 to 3 percent, the report asks the government to develop a more comprehensive prosecutorial strategy, establish a witness protection program and provide security for judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers.

The report included detailed accounts of the alleged torture and inhumane treatment of political and ethnic prisoners, including members of Gbagbo's family. Also in February, Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ivory-coast-ex-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to determine whether the case against him will proceed to trial. <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profiles/profile/1058/action/show/controller/Profile.html">Charles Ble Goude</a> [Trial Watch backgrounder], the former Ivory Coast Minister for Sports and Youth and close political ally of Gbagbo, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ally-of-ivory-coast-ex-president-charged-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes and murder in January.

One of the most far-reaching gun control laws in the country, the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/s/pdf/2013SB-01160-R00-SB.pdf">Gun Violence Prevention and Children's Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] adds 100 firearms to the state's assault weapons ban, prohibits the sale or purchase of magazines holding more than 10 rounds and creates the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry. The bill was drafted by the leaders of both major political parties in response to the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 that took the lives of 20 first graders and six educators. The 139-page bill was passed by the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/">Connecticut General Assembly</a> [official website] early Thursday morning with bipartisan support after 13 hours of debate. Parts of the legislation, including background checks for all firearm sales, will be effective immediately. 

<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] prompted a national <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST comment]. Last month, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to pass three bills which would require background checks for all private gun sales, renew a grant to improve schools security programs and make the act of buying a weapon for someone barred from owning one a federal crime. Several states have also taken steps to apply stricter gun laws in the wake of the shooting. Last month, Colorado Governor Hickenlooper <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] three bills mandating background checks for gun transfers and prohibiting the sale of large magazines. Also last month, the Maryland state senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would impose tougher restrictions on obtaining a license to buy a firearm.

There are roughly six million Roma throughout the EU, many of whom face abject poverty, substandard education, violent attacks and other forms of discrimination. In a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/wake-call-giant-eu-must-end-discrimination-against-roma-2013-04-04">press release</a> [text], AI said that the EU is not doing enough to protect Roma across member states and called upon the EU to "implement immediately the considerable measures at its disposal to sanction governments that are failing to tackle discrimination and violence against Roma." AI's press release comes on the eve of International Roma Day, which will take place on April 8 and has been recognized by a number of prominent figures <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/04/187589.htm">including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [State Department press release]. 

<p>Thursday's press release by AI is the latest in a series of reports which call for the end of discrimination against Roma. In January, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/euorpe-rights-court-condemns-hungary-segregation-of-roma-students.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Hungary for segregating Roma students and wrongly placing them in remedial schools. In September of last year, AI urged Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-still-discriminating-against-roma.php">change its discriminatory policies</a> [JURIST report] against the country's Roma. In August, AI <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ai-hungary-must-do-more-to-protect-roma-communities.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Hungary to protect the nation's Roma communities from attacks. The same month, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-experts-urge-wider-acceptance-of-roma-communities.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to end discrimination against Roma. In May, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) implored the government of Moldova to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/moldova-pushed-by-un-to-adopt-anti-discrimination-law.php">adopt a comprehensive anti-discrimination law</a> [JURIST report] that protects, among other groups, the Roma people.

In denying the motion to dismiss, Judge William Collette of the <a href="http://cc.ingham.org/">Thirtieth Judicial Circuit Court</a> rejected Shuette's argument that challenges to the laws must be brought in the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/coa/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Court of Appeals</a> [official website] rather than the lowest courts, as potential violations of the OMA are the most important legal issues to be considered. The suit was brought by Michigan's <a href="http://miaflcio.org/">State AFL-CIO</a>, its <a href="http://mea.org/">Education Association</a>, and its <a href="http://michiganbuildingtrades.org/index.html">Building and Construction Trades Council</a>, as well as the union coalition <a href="http://www.changetowin.org/">Change to Win</a> [advocacy websites] and several Democratic legislators. Together, the labor advocates contend that although the legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/michigan-enacts-freedom-to-work-bill.php">debated and passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28yhezkbnx4fbrgpmdjbbyqo45%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=home">Michigan Legislature</a> [official website] in December, the public was prohibited from entering the Capitol Building through the public entrance by Michigan state police in violation of the OMA, the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28grp45b453iu5pr552sl1b355%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> [materials], and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1toc_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. An evidentiary hearing on the allegations is expected this summer. 

<p>Michigan currently stands as the twenty-fourth state to enact "right-to-work" legislation. The state's right-to-work laws have been controversial since their passage and rapid approval by Republic <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder">Governor Rick Snyder</a> [official website] approximately four months ago. While JURIST Guest Columnist Karla Swift of the Michigan AFL-CIO has contended that the laws <a href="/hotline/2013/03/karla-swift-michigan-right-to-work.php">violate the OMA</a> [JURIST comment], Columnist <a href="http://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=tstanton">Theodore J. St. Antoine</a> [academic profile] of the University of Michigan Law School has nonetheless concluded that courts will <a href="/forum/2013/03/st-antoine-michigan-right-to-work.php">uphold the laws' core provisions</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In January, Snyder <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/michigan-governor-seeks-advisory-opinion-on-right-to-work-law.php">requested an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] on the constitutionality of the laws. Earlier that month, JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?prof=8">Susan Bitensky</a> [academic profile] of the Michigan State University College of Law <a href="/forum/2013/01/susan-bitensky-rtw-michigan.php">criticized Michigan's right to work law</a> [JURIST op-ed] as a bill that will "weaken the people and families who depend upon the benefits and protections negotiated by labor unions." In September, the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure was ultimately <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">defeated</a> [AP report] by a 57-43 margin. </p>]]></content:encoded>

BP is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-03/bp-appeals-spill-court-s-approval-of-claims-official-s-payouts.html">claiming</a> [Bloomberg report] that the administrator of the fund, Patrick Juneau, has wrongly awarded settlements to entities with only "absurd" and "imaginary" losses, referring to businesses which may have lost revenue as result of the spill but weren't directly impacted by the spill itself. The appeal follows just days after BP filed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/bp-settlement-administrator-urges-judge-to-dismiss-lawsuit-over-damages-determination.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Juneau for the administrator's awarding of settlement funds.

<p>The BP appeal comes as the court prepares to resume the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bp-gulf-oil-spill-trial-opens.php">non-jury trial to determine liability</a> [JURIST report] for the April 20, 2010, rupture of the Macondo well and explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. In January a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-judge-accepts-bp-guilty-plea-approves-4-billion-oil-spill-settlement.php">accepted a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] for the company's criminal liability in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Earlier in January, <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean Ltd.</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/transocean-agrees-to-14-billion-settlement-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to "negligently discharging oil into the Gulf of Mexico," in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/cwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [EPA summary] and will pay $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties for its role in the Deepwater Horizon spill. In December a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-approves-final-class-settlement-order-in-bp-oil-spill-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a final class settlement between BP and those who experienced economic and property loss stemming from the spill. In November BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges stemming from the oil spill. Earlier that month BP <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">agreed to pay</a> [JURIST report] $4.5 billion in penalties for felony misconduct for its role in the spill.

The bill came before the upper house of parliament after <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/france-lawmakers-approve-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approval</a> [JURIST report] in February by France's lower house of parliament. The bill is controversial, despite the fact that both houses of parliament are under the <a href="http://www.necn.com/04/04/13/Frances-senate-takes-up-gay-marriage-deb/landing_nation.html?&apID=497f2d62acc44eacb438366460fa4549">control</a> [AP report] of Socialist <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French; BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15311645">profile</a>] and his party. Those opposed to the bill protested outside of the upper house of parliament in Paris. While a narrow majority of French citizens support same-sex marriage, fewer favor allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. The French Senate is expected to debate the bill until April 13. If the bill is approved, France will be among about a dozen European countries that allow same-sex marriage. 

<p>Same-sex marriage has been controversial globally in recent years. On Tuesday, Uruguay's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted 23-8</a> [JURIST report] in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill creates one law covering marriage for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Last Wednesday, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the second of two cases the court heard this week on same-sex marriage.

Younis Masih has been in prison for six years. The charges against him stemmed from a incident in which allegedly interrupted a gathering of Sufi singing to <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/531352/blasphemy-case-court-acquits-christian-on-death-row/">make blasphemous remarks </a>[AFP report] in 2005. Masih is expected to be <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/pak-court-acquits-christian-man-death-row-blasphemy-054030147.html">released in several days</a> [ANI report]. According to article 295 of Pakistan's Criminal Code, 295-Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet, "Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine."  

<p>Pakistan's blasphemy legislation is highly contentious. In November 2012 a Pakistani court ordered police to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/pakistan-court-drops-blasphemy-charges-against-christian-girl.php">drop blasphemy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a 14-year-old girl. In August Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said that the country's blasphemy laws would not be misused to persecute religious beliefs. Zardari's comments came after the young girl's arrest. Police said after the girl's arrest that she may have Down syndrome. Blasphemy laws are currently in effect in several countries around the world. In July the US Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-state-department-releases-religious-freedom-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual International Religious Freedom Report, documenting threats to religious freedom throughout the world. The report documents current international threats to religious freedom&#8212;particularly laws that punish religious traditions and blasphemy laws that are often used to punish religious tolerance. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An online statement from the court said that <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/content/6619">Wang Quanzhang</a> [Human Rights in China backgrounder], a lawyer representing Falun Gong practictioner Zhu Yanian, had been detained for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/lawyers-in-china-protest-after-rights-lawyer-detained-after-defending-falun-gong-practitioner/2013/04/05/c31b5f02-9de3-11e2-9219-51eb8387e8f1_story.html">violating a court order</a> [AP report] but did not provide further details. <a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/li-fangping/">Li Fangping</a> [CDT backgrounder], one of the lawyers who signed the letter, said the court's decision has created a climate of fear in China's legal community. Three years ago, China <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/China-disbars-rights-lawyers .php">disbarred two lawyers</a> [JURIST report] for defending Fulan Gong members.

<p>China has come under international scrutiny recently regarding its human rights record. Last week police in China <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/china-authorities-arrest-brother-in-law-of-nobel-winner-liu-xiaobo.php">arrested and detained</a> [JURIST report] the brother-in-law of Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], which may have been retaliation for allegedly subversive activities by the Liu family against the Chinese government. In January China's Communist Party Politics and Law Committee head <a href="http://www.chinavitae.com/biography/Meng_Jianzhu%7C273">Meng Jianzhu</a> [China Vitae backgrounder]  notified Chinese media sources of the nation's plan to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/china-vows-to-reform-forced-labor-camps.php">end its 56 year-old "re-education through labor" program</a> [JURIST report], which authorizes government entities to legally detain citizens for as long as four years without trial. In December China adopted new rules which <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/china-adopts-strict-new-rules-on-internet-providers-and-users.php">impose new restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on the country's Internet Service Providers and individual users. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=navi+pillay">news archive</a>] called on China to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-china-to-address-human-rights-situation-in-tibet.php">remedy long-held frustrations in Tibet</a> [JURIST report] that have led to extreme protest tactics, including self-immolation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Scheduled to go into effect October 1 of this year, the new law will limit magazines to 10 bullets and will ban 45 types of semiautomatic rifles. The law also introduces a stricter licensing process that will require fingerprinting, passing classroom and range training and undergoing more extensive background checks. The bill received initial <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-strict-gun-control-bill.php">senate approval</a> [JURIST report] last month. The bill will now proceed to Governor Martin O'Malley for approval. O'Malley has <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=8562">publicly supported the bill</a> [press release] and is expected to sign the legislation soon. 

<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] sparked a national <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST comment]. Also Thursday Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a comprehensive gun control bill into law, placing new limits on the sale of firearms. Last month, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to pass three bills which would require background checks for all private gun sales, renew a grant to improve schools security programs and make the act of buying a weapon for someone barred from owning one a federal crime. Also last month, Colorado Governor Hickenlooper <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] three bills mandating background checks for gun transfers and prohibiting the sale of large magazines.

In January Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">signed 23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sabir K. was arrested in 2011 in Pakistan based on suspicions of plotting a suicide attack against American soldiers in Afghanistan, possession of guns and "destructive material" during attacks on US troops, and also for allegedly aiding <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-qaida">news archive</a>] between 2004 and 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of the 166 detainees in Guantanamo, about <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/05/us-usa-guantanamo-un-idUSBRE9340IU20130405">half have been cleared for transfer</a> [Reuters report], either to home countries or third countries for resettlement, while only nine of them have actually been charged or convicted of crimes. Pillay stressed that those who have been cleared for release must be released immediately, claiming the US government's continued detention of these individuals is a violation of the <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20999/volume-999-I-14668-English.pdf">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [PDF]. The High Commissioner also expressed concern about the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text">National Defense Authorization Act of 2013</a> [text], which she says has created obstacles for the closure of Guantanamo as well as for the trials of detainees in civilian courts.

<p>Last month the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] and defense lawyers for detainees held in the prison camp <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Rear Admiral <a href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/bios/navybio.asp?bioID=577">John Smith Jr.</a> [official profile] describing the harsh conditions faced by the detainees and indicated that the detainees have begun to protest the conditions, including participating in a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-human-rights-attorneys-on.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report]. In February lawyers for the US Navy <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-lawyers-say-surveillance-devices-did-not-breach-detainee-attorney-client-privileges.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that surveillance equipment deployed throughout the Guantanamo Bay detention center was not used to breach attorney-client privilege. Earlier in the month a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-orders-stop-to-911-hearing-censoring.php">ordered the removal</a> [JURIST report] of any monitoring system that censors the public broadcast of the hearings. In September a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on the ability of lawyers representing detainees who have had their <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges denied or dismissed to access their clients. In February 2012 the chief US military tribunal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/chief-guantanamo-judge-protects-confidentiality-of-attorney-client-mail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the content of attorney-client mail inspected at the Guantanamo Bay prison is confidential and may not be released.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website], Rupert Colville, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13211&LangID=E">briefed media sources</a> [press briefing notes] Friday, asserting that most executions violate "international norms and standards" of due process. Colville stressed that many alleged crimes leading to execution do not meet the "threshold of most serious crimes," execution often occurs after a long period on death row and many nations fail to provide adequate consular services to foreign nationals facing execution. Colville also expressed concern specifically about Asian and Middle Eastern nations reinstating the death penalty after years of moratorium and despite a "overwhelming global trend towards abolishing" the practice. According to Colville, the UN is particularly concerned about "massive" increases in executions in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Iraq, and continued contravention of fair trial standards, including convictions based on forced confession and trial proceedings falling short of international standards. Colville called on "all Governments concerned" to take measures to establish "an official moratorium on all executions" in accordance with General Assembly resolutions. According the UN, the moratorium, although not legally binding, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44570&Cr=death+penalty&Cr1=#.UV76tb81ZFI">carries moral and political weight</a> [press release], and approximately 150 countries have agreed to it.

<p>Application of the death penalty has remained a controversial issue around the globe, and the UN in particular has fought to abolish it for years. In March, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions Christof Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-restrict-use-of-death-penalty.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to restrict the use of capital punishment to comply with international human rights obligations. Also in March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-executions-in-saudi-arabia.php">condemned</a> [JURIST] the executions of seven people in Saudi Arabia as a violation of international safeguards on the use of the death penalty. The men were executed by firing squad after convictions for theft, looting and armed robbery. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reiterated his call for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-chief-calls-for-abolition-of-death-penalty.php">global support against the use of death penalty</a> [JURIST report], stressing that its application is inconsistent with the most fundamental human right principle: the right to life. A moratorium on the death penalty was first <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the UN General Assembly in 2007 and, as of December 2012, has gained the support of 111 countries, with 41 against and 34 neither supporting nor opposing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 30 days women of all ages can access the over-the-counter (OTC) emergency contraceptive. According to the court, the standards for aspirin, contraceptives and any other OTC drugs are the same. Availability is dependent upon whether the consumer understands hows to use the drug "safely and effectively." Evidence exhibited that adolescents aged 13-16 were capable of understanding and using the contraceptive correctly, therefore making the age requirement unnecessary. The court further stated that "the obstructions in the path of those adolescents in obtaining levonorgestrel-based emergency contraceptives under the current behind-the-counter regime have the practical effect of making the contraceptive unavailable without a doctor's prescription." A study revealed that misinformation and difficulty finding a doctor impeded young women and low-income women from obtaining the drug. 

<p>The Plan B contraceptive has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/fda-approves-over-counter-sale-of.php">winning approval</a> [JURIST report] from the FDA in 2006. In 2009 the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the FDA's decision to limit Plan B to women 18 years or older. The court ordered the FDA to make Plan B available to 17-year-olds without a prescription. In March 2008, a federal judge in the US District Court of the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians' group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the OTC sale of Plan B. In November 2007, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a Washington state law that would have required pharmacists to dispense the Plan B pill. In October 2007, Illinois pharmacists considered a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral objections to the contraception. Plan B contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that immobilizes sperm, reduces the number of sperm cells in the uterine cavity and prevents further sperm from entering the uterine cavity. The hormone can delay or prevent ovulation from occurring and is most effective when taken immediately after unprotected intercourse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU alleges that this practice is used in seven of the 11 counties investigated. The report claims that "there is no evidence that any of these people were given hearings to determine whether or not they were financially able to pay their fines, as required by the law." The report calls on the Ohio Supreme Court "to institute administrative rules to ensure that all courts properly determine whether a person can afford to pay her criminal fines, in order to ensure that those who are unable to pay are not incarcerated for these debts." 

<p>Thursday's brief reflects the findings of an ACLU investigation launched in 2012. In 2010, the ACLU released a report entitled <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/InForAPenny_web.pdf">"In for a Penny: The Rise of America's New Debtors' Prisons"</a> [text, PDF] profiling five states, including Ohio, which participate in the practice of so-called "debtors' prisons." Under this system, individuals who fail to pay their sentenced fines and court costs are assigned a monthly payment plan. If he or she does not make these payments, an arrest warrant will be issued, and the individual will be incarcerated for 10 days without bond. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of the <a href="http://lhc.gov.pk/new/">Lahore High Court</a> [official website] issued the ruling in the wake of Returning Officers, who are primarily lower court judges, asking candidates to recite specific passages in the Quran or <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pakistan-court-orders-poll-officials-to-stop-intrusive-questions/1098579/">asking inappropriate questions about candidates' personal lives</a> [PTI report]. Justice Shah proclaimed that his order was necessary to maintain the integrity of Pakistan's judiciary: "[T]he judiciary is there to achieve fair and free elections and not to carry out a witch hunt and demean the politicians of our country." In his decision, Justice Shah also ordered all election officials to forbid the broadcast of courtroom proceedings.

<p>Pakistan's judiciary has been the subject of international scrutiny recently. Earlier this week, the Lahore High Court acquitted a Christian man who was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-overturns-blasphemy-conviction-of-man-on-death-row.php">sentenced to death for blasphemy</a> [JURIST report].

Earlier in March the <a href="http://www.sindhhighcourt.gov.pk/index.shtml">High Court of Sindh Karachi</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-pakistan-leader-musharraf-granted-protective-bail-on-eve-of-return.php">granted protective bail</a> [JURIST report] to Musharraf.<big></big></p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNMISS report detailed the findings of a human rights investigation into the killing of 85 cattle herders in South Sudan's <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/perspective/2013/04/04/Rebellion-and-revenge-in-South-Sudan-s-Jonglei-state.html">Jonglei state</a> [AFP backgrounder], a majority of whom were women and children. The report found that the 85 victims were attacked by a group of armed men while taking their cattle to a grazing area. In the report, UNMISS called on the South Sudanese government to increase its protection of civilians and bring the perpetrators of these killings to justice: <blockquote>[South Sudan should] take all necessary steps to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators. A prime concern is the need to expand the long-term presence of security and rule of law institutions in areas most prone to violence in order to strengthen the protection of civilians. The widespread availability of weapons and ammunition in Jonglei State should also be reduced. Additionally, there is a need to strengthen appropriate mechanisms to determine the identities and the whereabouts of the people unaccounted for to facilitate their possible return to their families.</blockquote> The report also called for UNMISS to collaborate more closely with the South Sudan authorities to prevent violence.

<p>South Sudan has repeatedly been criticized for its human rights abuses since becoming an independent nation. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website]  urged South Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-south-sudan-to-reverse-expulsion-of-human-rights-officer.php">reverse an expulsion order</a> [JURIST report] against a UNMISS staff member, claiming the government has given no good reason to support the order. Earlier in November <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/south-sudan-urged-to-abolish-death-penalty.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to a government official urging the country to abolish the death penalty and stating that its executions do not even meet the minimum international standards provided by law. After a visit to the country in May, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-human-rights-chief-comments-on-visit-to-south-sudan.php">noted concerns</a> [JURIST report] with the country's detention procedures, impunity among security forces, discrimination against women and minorities and capital punishment practices. <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-south-sudan-to-prosecute-those-responsible-for-ethnic-violence.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the country's government in February 2012 for its failure to timely prosecute those responsible for an attack on ethnic minorities that killed thousands. South Sudan is still a new country, only officially being <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">recognized as an independent nation</a> [JURIST report] in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/04/20134661058364976.html">protest</a> [Al Jazeera report] was alleged to have sparked in response to bloggers criticizing conservative religious parties, although both secular and religious protesters have been in a state of violent unrest over the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=war+crimes+bangladesh">war crimes trials</a> [JURIST news archives] of JI leaders. On Wednesday, Home Minister <a href="http://www.mha.gov.bd/index5.php?category=104">Muhiuddin Khan</a> [official profile] said the government identified 11 bloggers who had "hurt the religious sentiments" of Bangladesh's Muslim population, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/bangladesh-bloggers_n_3009137.html">four individuals were arrested</a> [Huffington Post report] on those charges. The government has blocked many websites and blogs to stem the unrest, and has set up an intelligence panel to monitor for blasphemy on social media. Under the country's current cyber laws, a blogger can face up to ten years in prison for defaming a religion.

<p>Although the "Long March" protest of Saturday was religiously charged, violent protests have wracked Bangladesh since February in response to unpopular rulings by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page]. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-stop-violence-over-war-crimes-tribunal.php">UN rights experts</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-bangladesh-and-jamaat-e-islaami-must-encourage-end-to-recent-violence.php">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [JURIST reports] urged all parties involved to encourage an end to the violence in favor of peaceful protests. In February, the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">Bangladesh parliament</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-parliament-approves-amendments-to-war-crimes-law.php">report</a>] and the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-cabinet-approves-changes-to-war-crime-laws.php">Bangladesh Cabinet</a> [JURIST report] approved amendments to the country's war crimes laws to allow prosecutors to appeal sentences given to defendants convicted of war crimes. These amendments were a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">response to protests</a> that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, a JI leader, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">given a life sentence</a> [JURIST reports] for war crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The protesters believed a life sentence was too lenient and that Mollah, who was convicted of charges including murder, rape and torture, should have been given the death penalty. The law passed by parliament will be <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladeshs-parliament-amends-war-crimes-law-18523564">effective retroactively</a> [AP report] to July 2009, allowing prosecutors to appeal Mollah's sentence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's decision came in response to the request of Portugal's President <a href="http://www.presidencia.pt/?idc=3&idl=2">Anibal Cavaco Silva</a> [official website] for the court to determine whether retirees and public workers were being treated unfairly under the terms of the country's constitution. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22048169">finding</a> [BBC report] will deprive the country of approximately 1.5 billion euros in savings necessary to meet the terms of the 78 billion euro bailout granted to Portugal by the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and the <a href="http://www.esm.europa.eu/">European Stability Mechanism</a> (ESM) [official websites] in 2011, which requires Portugal to strictly control its spending. In order to meet the appropriate savings, the government must either find alternate savings and submit them as a supplementary budget to the parliament, or seek to renegotiate the terms of the bailout.

<p>Portugal is one of many European states struggling to recover from financial crisis of 2008.

The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports].

The lawyer, a member of the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website], supporters of President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohamed+morsi">Mohamed Morsi</a> [JURIST news archives], <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/04/07/egyptian-court-drops-lawsuit-to-ban-comedy-show/">filed the complaint</a> [AP report] earlier this week against Youssef, who hosts <a href = "http://www.albernameg.com/">Bernameg al-Bernameg</a>, a satirical news program similar to <a href = "http://www.thedailyshow.com/">the Daily Show</a> [official websites], asking the court to ban his show for allegedly insulting Morsi and containing sexual innuendos. In his opinion, Judge Hassouna Tawqif stated that he believed the president's office would not file a complaint against Youssef or anyone else practicing freedom of expression. Tawqif's opinion may serve as precedent to dismiss any charges against Youssef if they are filed. Egyptian authorities also brought Youssef in for questioning earlier this week as part of an investigation to determine whether criminal charges should be filed. The president's office, however, has publicly proclaimed that it is <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=435133706578977&set=a.390822984343383.93429.389032124522469&type=1&theater">not involved</a> [press release] in any of the legal actions against Youssef. Youssef was <A href = "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/68553/Egypt/Politics-/Court-saves-Youssef-from-Brotherhood-attempt-to-sh.aspx">released</a> [Ahram report] on bail Saturday.

<p>Egypt has been struggling to become more democratic and deal with human rights issues like freedom of speech ever since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-overturns-presidents-removal-of-prosecutor-general.php">overturned a decision</a> [JURIST report] by Morsi to remove the prosecutor-general because it was an abuse of his power under the country's constitution. Weeks earlier, a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] the country's scheduled upcoming elections so that it could review amendments to the election laws. In February, human rights groups in the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-rights-groups-ministry-of-interior-responsible-for-abuses.php">blamed the Ministry of Interior</a> [JURIST report] for police brutality and the deaths of protestors that have occurred since January. Days earlier, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized Egypt's new demonstration law</a> [JURIST report], which requires that protesters inform the government days before a planned protest and gives the government a right to reject these plans, saying that it violates international standards of freedom of assembly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protesters were speaking out against Montreal's <a href="http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=3620,4034187&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&params_recherche=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/sel/sypre-consultation/recherchereglement?params=type_regl=999**critere=**source=**type_recherche=0**total=0**crement=10**start_pos=1**acces=0**langue=en**instances=901**expression=**etendue=titre**statut=1**no_reglement=P-6**no_regl_cond=**applic_territ=0**bro_orderdate=2001-02-02**bro_endorderdate=2001-02-02**utilisateur=&has_been_there=1">Municipal Bylaw P-6</a> [materials], which allows the police to declare illegal any demonstration where participants failed to provide government authorities a copy of the itinerary in advance. The police said that three people were <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/story/2013/04/05/montreal-anti-police-brutality-protest.html">arrested for assault</a> [CBC report], and most of those arrested were processed and subsequently released. P-6 also prohibits protesters from wearing masks at demonstrations, and as a result police <a href="http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/montreal-protest-mascot-anarchopanda%E2%80%99s-head-seized-by-police-1">took the head of Anarchopanda</a> [CBC Canada report], a costume panda that was a popular icon at <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/06/quebec-students-seek-injunction-on-law-limiting-demonstrations.php">student protests in Quebec</a> [JURIST report] last year, as a possible exhibit to be used in court. The man who was inside the costume is a philosophy professor at <a href="http://www.cmaisonneuve.qc.ca/cegep-montreal-dec-preuniversitaire-technique-accueil">Maisonneuve College</a> [official website, in French] and received $1,274.00 in fines.

<p>Canada has been dealing recently with some controversial constitutional and civil rights issues. In February, the country's high court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/canada-supreme-court-upholds-hate-speech-laws.php">restrictions on hate speech</a> [JURIST report] do not violate the constitutional guarantees of free speech. Earlier that month, the high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld the country's ban on marijuana use</a> [JURIST report], overturning a lower court ruling that the ban was unconstitutional because it hindered citizens' ability to obtain the drug for medical use. In January, the high court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/quebec-common-law-couples-do-not-have-same-rights-as-married-couples.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that common law couples do not have the same rights as married couples in a challenge to Quebec's Civil Code. In August, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/canada-court-orders-judicial-review-of-prison-grievance-system.php">ordered a judicial review</a> [JURIST report] of the country's prison grievance system, stating that failure to address prisoners' complaints in a "fair and expeditious manner" violated the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C-44.6.pdf">Corrections and Conditional Release Act</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Joseph Romano was security chief of northern Italy's Aviano air base where Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was abducted <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/italy-pardons-us-air-force-officer-cia-case-18890335#.UWG7G5PEolM">prior to being flown to Egypt</a> [AP report]. Nasr was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. The US Department of Defense on Saturday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15916">welcomed</a> [press release] the news of Napolitano's pardon.

<p>The rendition of Nasr has resulted in several trials in Italy. In February, a Milan appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/milan-court-convicts-italian-spy-chief-for-role-in-cias-extraordinary-rendition-program.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Niccolo Pollari, the former Italian spy chief, to 10 years in prison for his role in the kidnapping of Nasr as part of the CIA's extraordinary rendition [JURIST news archive] program. Earlier that week a Milan appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/italy-court-convicts-3-americans-for-2003-rendition-kidnapping.php">convicted three Americans</a> [JURIST report] for their role in Nasr's kidnapping and rendition. Due to diplomatic immunity, all three men had been acquitted in the original <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-judge-convicts-23-former-cia.php">2009 conviction 23 former CIA agents</a> [JURIST report], including Romano. In September 2012 Italy's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of the 23 former CIA agents, whose sentences <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/italy-appeals-court-increases-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents.php">had been increased</a> [JURIST report] in December 2010 by an Italian appeals court.

The court held that FOIA requires agencies to review responsive documents and to tell requesters what documents the agency will produce, what it will withhold, and why, within 20 days of receiving the request. Otherwise the agency risks incurring a challenge in federal district court. There is an option for an agency to extend that deadline from 20 days to 30 days under certain unusual circumstances. The opinion found that an agency cannot rely on the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/oip/courtdecisions/exhaustion-admin-remedies.html"> exhaustion requirement</a> [DOJ backgrounder] to keep cases from being challenged in court. "[T]his scheme provides an incentive for agencies to move quickly but recognizes that agencies may not always be able to adhere to the timelines that trigger the exhaustion requirement." The DC Circuit reversed the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">DC District Court's</a> [official website] grant of a motion for <a href="http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=2&xmldoc=In%20FDCO%2020111230A87.xml&docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR&SizeDisp=7">summary judgment</a> [text] in favor of the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website] against a FOIA request challenge filed by <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW) [official website]. CREW <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/blog/entry/d.c.-circuit-hands-crew-a-big-win-on-foia-why-it-matters">declared the ruling to be a "big win"</a> [press release].

<p>The US Supreme Court has dealt with two major FOIA cases recently. On January 19, 2011, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-freedom-of-information-act.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether exemption 7(c) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) applies to corporations in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1279">FCC v. AT&#38;T</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The exemption allows for an agency to withhold information in response to a FOIA request if the agency reasonably believes that information would violate the individual's privacy. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-rules-corporations-lack-personal-privacy.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in March 2011 that the exemption did not apply to corporations. Also in March 2011, the Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-rules-against-government-in-freedom-of-information-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 8-1 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1163">Milner v. Department of the Navy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the government may not withhold certain information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This case <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-freedom-of-information-act.php">originated</a> [JURIST report] when petitioner Glen Scott Milner filed an FOIA request with a US Navy magazine relating to the explosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) of explosives stored in a naval magazine near Milner's home. </p>]]></content:encoded>

available to other persons, citizens and residents" of the state. The bill prohibits the state from funding abortion services and from granting tax credit for any sales incurred for an abortion. The bill also prohibits abortion providers from participating in public school sex education classes and delineates what information must be provided to patients seeking abortions. The Kansas House voted 90-30, and the Kansas Senate voted 28-10 to approve the bill. The bill will become law and take effect July 1 if it is signed by <a href="http://www.kansas.gov">Kansas Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website], who has <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">supported anti-abortion legislation</a> [JURIST report] in the past.

<p>Iraq set up a De-Baathification Commission in 2003 with the approval of the US-run Coalition Provisional Authority, and its early agenda was removing members of Hussein's Baath party from positions of power in the Iraqi government, prompting the <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/iraq-court-bans-100-former-baath.php">forced removal</a> [JURIST report] of nearly 30,000 Baathists from public life.

Defendants were scheduled to deliver <a href="http://www.abcnews4.com/story/21906649/thousands-protest-turkish-coup-plot-trial">closing statements</a> [AP report] on Monday, but mass protests outside the courtroom caused delays, as police used water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the thousands of demonstrators. Among those accused include retired generals, academics, politicians and journalists. Defendants are accused of being part of a secular terror group that allegedly plotted attacks as part of a military coup to overthrow the government, known as the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ergenekon">Ergenekon plot</a> [JURIST news archive]. The prosecution sought sentences as high as life in prison, while all of the defendants have maintained their innocence, rejecting all charges against them. The trial is scheduled to resume Thursday.

<p>In September a Turkish court convicted more than 300 people for their roles in the 2003 <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/haber/darbenin-adi-balyoz.htm">Balyoz Security Operation Plan</a> [Taraf report, in Turkish; Al Jazeera <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">backgrounder</a>], or <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sledgehammer">"Sledgehammer" plot</a> [JURIST news archive], which included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane in order to undermine the government. In June Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/turkish-police-arrest-6-former-military-officials-involved-in-1997-coup.php">arrested six former military officials</a> [JURIST report] for involvement in the 1997 coup that caused Turkey's Islamist-led government to resign. In April Turkey's Ankara 12th High Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/turkish-court-begins-trial-of-1980-military-coup-leaders.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of the last two surviving leaders of the 1980 coup that led to three years of military rule. Former president Kenan Evren faces a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-ex-president-faces-possible-life-sentence-for-1980-military-coup.php">possible life sentence</a> [JURIST report] in that trial. In 2010 a Turkish court also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of 33 retired and active naval officers who allegedly planned to overthrow the government and implement military rule. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdallah has been <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/supreme-judicial-council-calls-prosecutor-general-leave-office">criticized</a> [Egypt Independent report] by the liberal opposition who accuse him of targeting critics of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>], the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website], and independent media, including the popular television satirist Bassem Youssef who was recently <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/03/egypt-questions-comedian-over-satirist-show/">arrested</a> [Daily News Egypt report] for allegedly insulting Islam and Morsi. Abdallah was appointed after Morsi dismissed the former Prosecutor-General Abdel-Meguid Mahmoud last November in a controversial declaration that also immunized Morsi's own decisions from judicial appeal. Presidential spokesman Omar Amer said last week that Abdullah will remain in office despite an Egyptian appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-court-overturns-presidents-removal-of-prosecutor-general.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] last month that stated that the Prosecutor-General post is not subject to presidential dismissal.

<p>Egypt has been the seat of political unrest since the <a href="/feature/2012/09/egyptian-revolution.php">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] began two years ago. In a controversial move last month, Abdallah <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/top-egypt-prosecutor-issues-arrest-warrants-for-5-activists.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] arrest warrants for five activists for their alleged involvement in an opposition campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood and President Morsi. To quell the growing violence and unrest that resulted in the deaths of at least 50 Egyptians, President Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a state of emergency in January, giving military the authority to arrest and detain instigators. During the same month, rights group <a href="http://eipr.org/en">Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-rights-group-says-police-violence-continues.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that police abuse and torture has not improved since the abuses experienced under former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera Profile].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The allegations stem from Musharraf's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">1999 military overthrow</a> [BBC backgrounder] of democratically-elected prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] and his subsequent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistans-top-court-orders-former-president-musharraf-to-appear-in-treason-case/2013/04/08/bebd342e-a024-11e2-bd52-614156372695_story.html">suspension</a> [AP report] of the nation's constitution. Pakistani authorities also alleged that Musharraf was involved in the assassination of former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> [JURIST news archive], who was killed in 2007 in a suicide attack at a rally in Rawalpindi after returning from exile in Great Britain and Dubai. Musharraf returned to Pakistan in late-March to be a candidate in the nation's May 11 parliamentary elections, ending a four-year self-imposed exile. While many local districts have reportedly rejected his nomination, he was recently given approval to run in a remote district in northern Pakistan. However, the treason allegations may complicate his election bid and a hearing on the matter has been scheduled for Tuesday. If convicted of treason, Musharraf may face execution. 

<p>Musharraf's return to Pakistan is fraught with controversy. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. Months earlier, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after his failure to respond to multiple subpoenas related to the assassination investigation. In 2011 Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve</a> [JURIST report] it on him because he was living in London at the time. That warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto on the day that she was assassinated. Musharraf has dealt with treason charges stemming from the 1999 coup in the past as well. In August 2009 the Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pakistan-high-court-refuses-musharraf.php">rejected a petition</a> [JURIST report] seeking treason charges against Musharraf, finding that the applicant lacked standing and that the Supreme Court was not the appropriate forum for such a petition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4038803.stm">BBC profile</a>] signed a <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/27345.html">decree</a> [press release] on Sunday pardoning Yuriy Lutsenko, a former interior minister and a close ally of the imprisoned former prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>]. Lutsenko was serving a four-year sentence on charges of abuse of office and embezzlement, while Tymoshenko is serving a seven-year sentence on charges of abuse of office. The EU has warned that it will <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/ukraine-yanukovych-lutsenko-pardon/24950001.html">not sign a cooperation agreement</a> [RFE/RL report] with Kiev until these two cases are resolved, as many believe the cases are politically motivated. This pressure, along with petitioning from the country's human rights official, prompted the president to pardon Lutsenko. Upon being released, Lutsenko said he intends to remain politically active. He advocated for Tymoshenko's release as well, but she has other charges pending and has not exhausted all legal options. The pardon comes just a week after a Ukrainian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ukraine-court-dismisses-tymoshenko-ally-appeal.php">dismissed Lutsenko's appeal</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Critics have labeled these cases as an attempt for Yanukovych to control his opposition. In February Tymoshenko was fined USD $2,000 for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jailed-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-fined-for-contempt.php">contempt</a> [JURIST report] of court after a hearing in Kiev. In January the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/lawyer-for-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-under-criminal-investigation.php">state began investigating</a> [JURIST report] her lawyer for several criminal charges.

As Monday was International Roma Day, UN Independent Expert on Minority Issues <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Minorities/IExpert/Pages/RitaIzsak.aspx">Rita Izsak</a> [official profile] commended the international community for its efforts in protecting the Roma people but stated that "political and legislative commitments must be implemented in reality to bring the so much needed changes into the lives of Roma." It is estimated that 12 million Roma live in Europe, with sizable populations residing in Latin America, spanning all ages, regions and populations. The UN reported that most of them live in the margins of society and are forced daily to deal with struggles such as forced sterilization, discrimination in employment, deportation and inability to obtain identification documents. Izsak called on the European nations to "go beyond words and take action" to punish and prevent these types of discrimination.

<p>Izsak's statement is the latest in a series of reports advocating for more support for the Roma people and an end to discriminatory practices by European countries and populations. Last week, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] claimed that the EU was not doing enough to protect Roma across member states and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rights-group-urges-eu-to-end-discrimination-aginst-roma.php">demanded that sanctions be implemented</a> [JURIST report] for failing to address the discrimination and violence. In January, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_en/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/euorpe-rights-court-condemns-hungary-segregation-of-roma-students.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Hungary for segregating Roma students and wrongly placing them in remedial schools. In September, AI also urged Italy to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-still-discriminating-against-roma.php">change its discriminatory policies</a> [JURIST report] against the country's Roma. AI had <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-still-discriminating-against-roma.php">voiced a similar sentiment</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier to the government of Hungary. In August, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-experts-urge-wider-acceptance-of-roma-communities.php">urged</a> the international community to end discrimination against Roma, while advocating for a <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/moldova-pushed-by-un-to-adopt-anti-discrimination-law.php">comprehensive anti-discrimination law</a> [JURIST reports] to be adopted in Moldova that would protect the Roma people as well as a number of other groups. More than a year ago, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/human-rights-watch-releases-report-on-minority-discrimination-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina to stop discriminating against Roma. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-house-approves-bill-to-legalize-medical-marijuana.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the state's House of Delegates in a 108-28 vote last month. The bill would establish the Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Marijuana Commission, which would function within the <a href="http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/16dhmh/html/dhmh.html">Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a> [official website] to authorize medical centers to distribute marijuana to patients who meet the criteria for compassionate use. The commission could license up to five medical marijuana growers in the state for each approved program and would be required to provide an annual report to the governor. If signed by <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website], the bill will become law and take effect on October 1. 

<p>If HB 1101 is approved, Maryland would join several states with laws that allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. The sale and use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive], however, remains a hot-button issue in the US and abroad. Last month, the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the private sale of <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. The top court in Ontario also <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban</a> [JURIST report] on marijuana a week earlier. In December, an Arizona judge ruled that the state's law permitting <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">use of medical marijuana is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November, lawmakers in Uruguay proposed legislation for <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">state-regulated sale and use of marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month, <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] and <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] for both medical and recreational use via state ballot initiatives. Medical marijuana was also <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts</a> [Harvard Crimson report] for the first time that month when more than 60 percent of voters <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">approved a similar referendum</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF]. The Oregon electorate, however, <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">rejected a cannabis initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] by a <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">vote of approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Section 337A of the law outlaws intercourse between men in both public and private settings, and imposes punishments of up to two years in prison. While the provision has not been enforced actively by Singapore authorities against men who engage in consensual sex in private, same-sex couples in Singapore seek to have the law overturned so they are not identified as a criminal class. The plaintiffs in the case challenged the law on the basis that they are not treated equally under the law as required by the Singapore Constitution. In his ruling Friday, Justice Quentin Loh Sze-On asserted that the decision of the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/">Parliament of Singapore</a> [official website] to <a href="http://160.96.186.104/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00072427-ZZ&currentPubID=00075232-ZZ&topicKey=00075232-ZZ.00072427-ZZ_1%2B%2B">retain the law</a> [Parliament report] in 2007 was not "undeniably wrong," and so it is not the place of the court to substitute its own views for that of the parliament. In an analysis running back to the creation of a similar Constitutional provision by the US, the ruling stated classifications are inevitable and are permissible as long as they are reasonable.  

<p>Same-sex rights have been a hotly debated topic around the world in recent years, including topics ranging from the right to marry to adoption and even to health care coverage for same-sex spouses. Last week, France's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-senate-debates-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption.php">commenced debate</a> [JURIST report] of a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage and allow same-sex couples to adopt children. That same day, the <a href="http://www.aclunv.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada</a> (ACLU-NV) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/aclu-challenges-nevada-law-criminalizing-samesex-intercourse-for-teens.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging a state law criminalizing consensual sex between same-sex teenagers. Additionally, Uruguay's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report], creating one law covering marriage for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Last month, Vermont's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/vermont-house-health-care-for-same-sex-spouses.php">approved a bill</a> requiring out-of-state employers to provide the same health care coverage to same-sex couples as it would for employees with an opposite-sex spouse. Also in March, the Tribal Chairman of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, a northern Michigan Native American tribe, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-the-little-traverse-bay.php">signed into law</a> a measure approving same-sex marriage [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking at <a href= http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Pages/default.aspx>The Hague</a> [official website] during a press conference held jointly with the Dutch foreign minister, Ban emphasized the value in solidifying the relationship between the UN and the Netherlands. <a href= http://www.un.org/sg/offthecuff/index.asp?nid=2776>In his statement</a> [transcript], Ban emphasized the role the Netherlands plays in international issues:<blockquote>The Netherlands is one of the biggest donor countries to UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and all the Specialized Agencies and has generously contributed to humanitarian assistance for Syrian refugees and also Mali. We sincerely hope that the Netherlands will continue to do so, despite the current economic situation in European eurozone areas.</blockquote>Ban also praised the Netherlands as "a champion of human rights and gender equality."

<p>Last year a Dutch court ruled that three Congolese witnesses who testified in an <a href= http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx>International Criminal Court</a> [official website] (ICC) case against militia leader Germain Katanga must be allowed to remain in the Netherlands to seek asylum.

Kenyatta, who is the son of Kenya's first president <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">was elected</a> [JURIST report] in a closely contested race with 50.07 percent of the vote. Kenyatta is currently facing <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] charges of crimes against humanity for his alleged involvement in violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">2007 election</a> [JURIST news archive]. Unlike the 2007 election where <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] led to more than a thousand deaths in ethnic clashes following the election, this election cycle was relatively calm.    

<p>Kenyatta's election has been surrounded by controversy. In March Kenyan <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appealed the results</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">Kenya's 2013 election</a> [JURIST report] to Kenya's <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/the-supreme-court.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Later that month Kenya's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the results of the country's presidential election were valid. Earlier in March Kenyatta's lawyer asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him for lack of evidence, but the prosecution refused. Kenyatta's request was based on the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1568411.pdf">withdrawal</a> [decision, PDF] of charges against co-defendant Francis Muthaura for lack of evidence. Kenyatta's lawyers claimed the evidence against Muthaura and Kenyatta was the same, but the prosecution disagreed. Kenyatta's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php#">previously postponed</a> [JURIST report], and it will begin on July 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf is also accused of being involved in the assassination of former Pakistani prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> [JURIST news archive]. Following a four year self-imposed exile, Musharraf returned to Pakistan in March to be a candidate in Pakistan's parliamentary elections.

<p>Musharraf's return to Pakistan has been controversial. In March, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharrf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011, Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve the warrant</a> [JURIST report] because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Less than two years after the uprising that overthrew dictator <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Moammar Gadhafi</a> [BBC obituary], Libya's new government has continued its efforts to rein in the country's armed militias. These militias have been known to capture and torture citizens, including the Chief of Staff of Prime Minister Ali Zidan, who was kidnapped last week and released on Monday. The relationship between the government and the militias has been codependent since 2011, with the militias filling in the gaps in security as Libya works to build its new government. The government has begun to try to control the militia's tactics. Despite the kidnapping and torture laws, many <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/09/uk-libya-law-idUKBRE9380WU20130409?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews">doubt that the government has the strength</a> [Reuters report] to enforce its new laws. The militias have reacted to criticism with force and threats. 

<p>This is the latest in the ongoing efforts to ensure a properly-functioning justice system and promote reconciliation in Libya after the 2011 conflict. In March, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-libya-government-to-ensure-protection-of-civilians.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Libya government to ensure the protection of civilians. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/libya-court-begins-trial-of-gaddafi-era-officials.php">trial</a> [JURIST report] of 40 former Libyan officials began earlier in March, in al-Zawiya. The charges included inciting the killing of protesters during the revolution, wasting public funds, embezzlement and abuse of power. In February, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">called on Libya</a> [JURIST report] to extradite former Gaddafi intelligence chief <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profile]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In its <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/sites/impact.amnesty.org/files/PUBLIC/2012DeathPenaltyAI.pdf">annual review of death sentences and executions</a> [report, PDF], AI concluded that at least 682 individuals were executed in 2012. Twenty-one countries carried out the death penalty in 2012, down from 28 in 2003. The countries employing the death penalty most frequently in 2012 were China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the US. Iran saw a dramatic increase in executions, and India, Japan and Pakistan resumed capital punishment after execution-free periods. Methods of executions included hanging, beheading, firing squad and lethal injection. AI publishes estimates of death penalty statistics for some nations because several governments do not record or publish data on death sentences and executions. AI does not include an estimate of executions carried out in China where the data is kept secret, though the advocacy group believes that thousands of people are executed there. AI opposes capital punishment in all circumstances and campaigns for the complete abolition of the death penalty.

<p>Application of the death penalty has remained a controversial issue around the globe. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/gashc4058.doc.htm">approved a draft resolution</a> [press release] urging all nations to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-calls-for-worldwide-death-penalty-moratorium.php">establish a moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty with a view towards abolishing its application worldwide. In March, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions Christof Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-restrict-use-of-death-penalty.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to restrict the use of capital punishment to comply with international human rights obligations. Also in March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-executions-in-saudi-arabia.php">condemned</a> [JURIST] the executions of seven people in Saudi Arabia as a violation of international safeguards on the use of the death penalty. The men were executed by firing squad after convictions for theft, looting and armed robbery. In February, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reiterated his call for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-chief-calls-for-abolition-of-death-penalty.php">global support against the use of death penalty</a> [JURIST report], stressing that its application is inconsistent with the most fundamental human right principle: the right to life. A moratorium on the death penalty was first <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-rights-committee-approves-death.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the UN General Assembly in 2007 and, as of December 2012, has gained the support of 111 countries, with 41 against and 34 neither supporting nor opposing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kaplan said the start date would be <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/10/abu-ghaith-trial-delayed-sequester">delayed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] because of the US budget sequester forcing lawyers to be furloughed for several weeks. Abu Ghaith has been charged with conspiring to kill Americans in his role as al Qaeda's chief propagandist. Abu Ghaith was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] in Jordan on February 28 and brought to the US on March 1. He <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bin-laden-son-in-law-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-of-al-qaeda-involvement.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] on March 8. Abu Ghaith's lawyers, Martin Cohen and Philip Weinstein, have said they intend to file several pretrial motions challenging the prosecution, including requests that the trial moved from a courthouse several blocks from the World Trade Center complex and that a statement Ghaith provided to US authorities be suppressed.

<p>Many cases involving al Qaeda operatives are making their way through the US judicial system. In January the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href=/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php>vacated the conspiracy conviction</a>[JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, Osama bin Laden's media secretary. In October Egyptian-born Muslim cleric Abu Hamza Al Masri <a hre=/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php>pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges. His charges include taking hostages, providing material support to terrorist groups, including al Qaeda, and conspiring to do such acts. He made his first appearance in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York after being extradited from the UK. Osama Bin Laden was <a href=/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php>killed</a> [JURIST report] by US military personnel in 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Act requires clinics that provide abortions to meet the same standards as ambulatory care centers, requires doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals, and includes strong enforcement against doctors or clinics that do not comply. Alabama's Congress <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> the legislation last week, after an <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/alabama-house-approves-bill-tightening-regulation-of-abortion-clinics.php">initial approval</a> [JURIST reports] by the state's <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/house.html">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in February. Planned Parenthood has <a href="http://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/04/Planned-Parenthood-Southeast-Denounces-Anti.pdf">denounced</a> [press release] the bill, stating that it will lead to "an almost certain legal challenge" as the provisions "do not support women's health and would be difficult for nearly all providers to meet." Bentley said that "[a]s a physician, and as a governor, I am proud to sign this legislation."

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Also last week, the Indiana House of Representatives passed <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2013/PDF/ES/ES0371.1.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] which would require that clinics which offer the drug commonly called the "abortion pill" or "RU486" must also meet certain design and equipment standards as clinics which provide surgical abortions. Last month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2011 the criminal <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/guatemala-ex-president-begins-embezzlement-trial.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report] against Portillo were thrown out by the lower court, which found that prosecutors had failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that Portillo was personally involved in the embezzlement of Guatemala's <a href="http://www.mindef.mil.gt/">Ministry of Defense</a> [official website, in Spanish] funds. The appeals court <a href="http://www.elperiodico.com.gt/es/20130410/pais/226770/">rejected</a> [<em>El Periodico</em> report, in Spanish] the government's appeal, finding that the lower court ruling was not in error.

Nadim Houry, deputy director for Middle East and North Africa at HRW, released the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/10/egypt-address-recurring-sectarian-violence">statement</a> [press release] in response to violence between Muslims and Coptic Christians in the town of Khosus that resulted in the deaths of five Christians and one Muslim. HRW claims this type of sectarian violence is rarely investigated adequately. Because of this, Houry called on Morsi to recognize the core issues that cause the violence and do more to address the problem before it escalates. According to HRW, an important part of addressing this problem is reforming Egypt's laws that discriminate against Christians. Houry continued in calling for Morsi to force the police to carry out proper investigations to insure those responsible are found and dealt with justly. 

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing protests and violence since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">2011 Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder].

Earlier in February, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-office-criticizes-egypt-draft-demonstration-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's draft law on demonstrations for failure to adequately protect freedom of assembly. In late January the UN High Commission for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-chief-voices-concern-over-increasing-violence-in-egypt.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the growing violence and rising death toll in Egypt stemming form ongoing protest throughout the country. On January 28, 2013 President Mohamed Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] in an attempt to quell growing unrest and violent political protests in several cities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Madoff victims had argued that the SEC was liable under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> (FCTA) [28 USC &#167; 1346(b)] for failing to detect Madoff's Ponzi scheme and the resulting financial damages. The FTCA is an exception to the US government's sovereign immunity. The court found that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2680">Discretionary Function Exemption</a> (DFE) [28 USC &#167; 2680], an exception to the FTCA exception, applied and thus barred the Madoff victims' suit. The DFE applies where the allegedly negligent acts are discretionary and the judgment in choice is grounded in consideration of public policy or susceptible to policy analysis. Since the SEC's decision whether to pursue a case is discretionary and the decision was due to a policy consideration of allocation of SEC resources, the DFE applied. Although the court dismissed the Madoff victims' complaint, the court referred to the SEC's conduct as "regrettable inaction" and stated that was forced to make this ruling "[d]espite our sympathy for Plaintiffs' predicament (and our antipathy for the SEC's conduct)." A <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-affirms-dismissal-of-madoff-victim-lawsuit-against-sec.php">similar decision</a> [JURIST report] was made in the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in January in another lawsuit of Madoff victims against the SEC. 

<p>Madoff's scheme is believed to have defrauded investors of over $65 billion. Last July the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> (SDNY) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved the first payouts</a> [JURIST report] to Madoff's victims. Madoff trustee Irving Picard <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">filed almost 60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010, including suits against large banks like JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. Judge Louis Stanton made Picard the trustee of Bernard L Madoff Securities, LLC in December 2008. Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison for securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud in March 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/11/11-2242.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that a New Mexico school district acted constitutionally when it prohibited five students from distributing two-inch rubber fetus dolls with pro-life cards attached. Writing for the unanimous three-judge panel, the Honorable Scott Matheson, Jr. opined that the school's restrictions on handing out the dolls and its policy requiring the principal's preapproval to engage in promotional activities on campus did not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights of the students. Specifically, the court held the students' free speech actions, though normally protected even if private and not school-sponsored, "reasonably forecasted that the distribution of the rubber dolls would lead to a substantial disruption," thus justifying the school's restrictions. In January 2010, the religious group of students, known as "Relentless," distributed 300 dolls at <a href="http://www.risd.k12.nm.us/schools/high/ghs/index.cfm">Goddard High School</a> [official website] in Roswell, New Mexico. The size of the dolls, two inches, was meant to suggest the size of a fetus at 12 weeks of gestation, as indicated by the card's description of the doll as a "12-week old baby." While the group planned to distribute a total of 2,500 dolls between Goddard High and <a href="http://www.risd.k12.nm.us/schools/high/rhs/index.cfm">Roswell High School</a> [official website], teachers at both schools complained that their students' preoccupation with the dolls disrupted classroom discussion, prompting school administrators to quickly end the dolls' distribution. The Tenth Circuit reasoned:<blockquote>The sheer number of items ... created strong potential for substantial disruption. Furthermore, these fetus dolls were made of rubber, a material that could easily be, and was, pulled apart, bounced against walls, and stuck to ceilings. The dolls' small size made them tempting projectiles and toilet-clogging devices. This scenario carries more potential for disruption than the passive, silent act of wearing a T-shirt or a black armband. And that potential quickly came to fruition.</blockquote>Although this disruption was caused by those receiving the dolls rather than the group, the court further reasoned that "the government has a compelling interest in protecting the educational mission of the school and ensuring student safety."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a controversial issue across the country. Similar to the fetus doll dispute, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nced.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina</a> [official website] in December <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-strikes-down-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that North Carolina could not offer specialty pro-life license plates without offering a pro-choice alternative. There, the court found that the "Choose Life" license plates were an expression of private speech rather than government speech which would have allowed the North Carolina General Assembly to regulate the message. In November 2011, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">ordered an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to prevent North Carolina from issuing the same license plates. The lawsuit was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-north-carolina-pro-life-license-plates.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://acluofnc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website] in September 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation criminalizes blasphemy, including the public insulting and humiliating of religious rites and groups, as well as the desecration of religious objects. The bill proposes penalties of up to three years in prison and fines of 300,000 rubles. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22090308">legislation was created</a> [BBC report] partially in response to the Russian feminist rock band <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] after a "guerrilla performance" of a protest song last year at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.

<p>Free speech has been a contentious issue in Russian politics recently.

The court ruled that the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government was "extremist" and President Vladimir Putin argued that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population. In July the Duma <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russian-parliament-adopts-controversial-internet-regulation-bill.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to a controversial Internet regulation bill, which gives the Russian government the ability to completely block access to certain websites, is described by its authors as a means of protecting children from harmful content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manning has pleaded guilty to several other charges, but is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/10/bradley-manning-trial-wikileaks-suspect">contesting</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the most serious charge of aiding the enemy. Lind ruled that to meet the standard of proof for the charge, the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Manning knowingly dealt with and helped an enemy of the US, including al Qaeda, by releasing classified information. The prosecution will reportedly seek to prove this in part by showing documents leaked by Manning actually reached the enemy. This will be done through an anonymous witness that recovered pieces of digital media from Osama bin Laden's compounded that were leaked to <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wikileaks">news archive</a>] by Manning. The defense is protesting the use of an anonymous witness that restricts their access to discovery and cross-examination.

<p>Since his arrest in 2010, Manning's case has been controversial. In February Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against him for providing classified materials to WikiLeaks.

In January Lind <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/wikileaks-judge-prosecutors-must-prove-defendant-knew-he-was-aiding-enemy.php">ruled</a> that prosecutors must prove that Manning knew he was aiding the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports].

In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict.

The law provides that the People's Assembly, Egypt's lower house of parliament, will consist of 546 seats, and it will also divide the country's electoral map into 129 electoral districts. Members of the current Assembly, particularly those of the leftist National Salvation Front, have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-egypt-elections-law-idUSBRE93A0J720130411">objected</a> [Reuters report] to the laws as a mechanism to suit Islamist politicians to the detriment of secular advocates. The Islamist-led upper house will now send the lower house election law and a revised political rights law to the the country's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> (SCC) [official website], which will rule on the legality of the bills to govern the vote. This year's parliamentary elections will replace the lower house, which was led by members of the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [party website], that was dissolved by a court ruling last year.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month, the country's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed electoral law to the SCC for review, thereby delaying parliamentary elections originally set to begin on April 22. The court's decision was said to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-egypt-elections-court-idUSBRE9250S320130306">based on technical grounds</a> [Reuters report], namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral law to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was amended in five key areas, as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">demanded by the high court</a> [JURIST report] in February. Also in March, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution. Specifically, the complaints challenged the method for selecting the assembly's members, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report] by liberals and Christians as a misrepresentation of all Egyptians. In February, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-postpones-ruling-on-constitutional-assembly.php">postponed ruling</a> [JURIST report] on whether the assembly was legitimate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-eu-google-idUSBRE93A0HK20130411">recent proposal</a> [Reuters report] has revised the initial proposal that was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/global/google-submits-proposals-to-resolve-european-antitrust-concerns.html?_r=0">submitted in January</a> [NYT report]. The January proposal came after the EU's competition commissioner warned the company to change its business practices or be subject to antitrust charges. The investigation has been focused on whether the company unfairly used its dominance of the Internet search market to benefit its other services. The commission will now review the proposal and determine whether it will accept a settlement without fine.

<p>In January the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] held that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ftc-finds-google-did-not-violate-antitrust-or-anticompetition-laws.php">Google did not violate</a> [JURIST report] antitrust or anticompetition laws. The claims in the case were similar to those currently pending in the EU: Google's practice of favoring its own services in search results, to the detriment of its competitors. Google has faced other numerous allegations regarding its business practices over the past several years internationally. In December an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a conviction against Google executives for privacy violations. In November a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $22.5 million fine against Google for privacy misrepresentations. In February of last year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Google's privacy changes by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website].

The debate was <a href="https://www.un.org/en/ga/president/67/letters/pdf/Thematic%20Debate_Role%20of%20International%20Criminal%20Justice%20in%20Reconciliation%20-%2011%20February%202013.pdf">orchestrated</a> [organic letter, PDF] by General Assembly President <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/67/about/">Vuk Jeremic</a> [official website] who claimed during the opening of the debate the "the paramount question is how international criminal justice can help reconcile former adversaries in post-conflict, transitioning societies." Jeremic, a Serb from the former Yugoslavia also claimed that "Reconciliation will come about when all the parties to a conflict are ready to speak the truth to each other. Honouring all the victims is at the heart of this endeavour. That is why it is so critically important to ensure atrocities are neither denied, nor bizarrely celebrated as national triumphs." Jeremic continued on to say that "Reconciliation is in its essence about the future, about making sure we do not allow yesterday's tragedies to circumscribe our ability to reach out to each other, and work together for a better, more inclusive tomorrow."

<p>Despite the outward tone of unity coming from the debate, some have claimed that the real purpose of the debate was to serve as a criticism of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. The US, Canada and Jordan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-serbia-un-boycott-idUSBRE93A02O20130411">boycotted</a> [NYT report] the session claiming it was a "thinly veiled" attack on criminal tribunals. In a statement from Erin Pelton, spokeswoman for the US mission to the UN, the position of the US is that "ad hoc international criminal tribunals and other judicial institutions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone and Cambodia have been critical to ending impunity and helping these countries chart a new, more positive future." Pelton went on to claim the debate failed "to provide the victims of these atrocities an appropriate voice."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="/feature/2013/03/the-syrian-civil-war.php">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has lasted for nearly two years, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence.

Uruguay's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] last week. The bill passed the lower house of congress with <a href="http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/votacion-de-matrimonio-igualitario-empezo-con-polemica-por-bandera.html">71 of 92 lawmakers voting in favor</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish], despite strong <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22102740">opposition from the Catholic Church</a> [BBC report] in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. The bill, which is expected to be signed into law by <a href="http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/presidente">President Jose Mujica</a> [official profile, in Spanish], clarifies rules for adoption and in-vitro fertilization, eliminates "husband and woman" in marriage contracts by replacing those terms with "contracting parties," and allows same-sex couples to chose the order of surnames of the children they adopt. Thursday's vote is the latest in a series of steps towards equality for same-sex couples in Uruguay, with same-sex civil unions, adoption by gay couples and allowing homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces all being approved in recent years. If the bill is ultimately signed into law, Uruguay will be the twelfth country in the world, and the second in Latin America, to legalize same-sex marriage.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial globally in recent years. Last week, France's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-senate-debates-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption.php">commenced debate</a> of a bill, which was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] by the National Assembly in February, that would allow same-sex couples to get married and adopt children. Last month, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)[text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">report</a>], which defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes, and <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">report</a>], which amends the California constitution to only recognize marriages between one man and one woman. Also in March, a Native American Tribe in northern Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-the-little-traverse-bay.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a measure recognizing same-sex marriage. In February, the UK parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill. In June of 2012, Denmark <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/denmark-parliament-passes-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage law, making it the eleventh country to do so. In May of 2012, the City of Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/argentina-district-recognizes-same-sex-marriage-for-foreigners-tourists.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to recognize same-sex marriages for non-citizens. That same month, the Israeli Knesset <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-parliament-rejects-civil-marriage-bill.php">rejected a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have legalized civil marriages not approved by Jewish Law, including same-sex marriages. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Thursday called on the Ukrainian government to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/EUR50/004/2013/en%20">investigate police abuses</a> [report; <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news/ukraine-make-police-accountable-and-stamp-out-torture-2013-04-11">press release</a>] and strengthen mechanisms to hold police accountable for brutality and torture. In a report, AI alleged that reports of police abuse and torture have been widely ignored. The rights group encouraged the Ukrainian government to take advantage of its new penal code, approved last year, which affords more rights to the accused and suggests the creation of a commission to investigate allegations of police brutality. AI's report stated that out of 114,474 reports of police abuse in 2012, only 1,750 were investigated, and less than 500 were subsequently prosecuted. AI called on the Ukrainian government to create an independent commission to investigate allegations of police abuses and to hold officers accountable for misconduct. 

<p>The Ukraine has faced worldwide criticism for its handling of the criminal trials of former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST news archive] and her supporters. Although Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ukraine-president-pardons-tymoshenko-ally.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] a former interior minister and a close ally of Tymoshenko earlier this month, Tymoshenko remains in prison facing numerous charges. Critics have labeled these cases as an attempt for Yanukovych to control his opposition. In February Tymoshenko was fined USD $2,000 for <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jailed-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-fined-for-contempt.php">contempt</a> [JURIST report] of court after a hearing in Kiev. In January the state began <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/lawyer-for-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-under-criminal-investigation.php">investigating her lawyer</a> [JURIST report] for several criminal charges. Tymoshenko has already been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> on corruption charges and is currently awaiting trial on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">tax evasion</a> [JURIST reports]. In September the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a resolution calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. Last July, the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/europe-rights-court-rules-ukraine-officials-detention-was-arbitrary.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that the arrest and detention of Lutsenko violated the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The class action lawsuit, brought in 2004, accused the defendants of conducting an illegal bid-rigging scheme, as well as making false statements about accounting issues that led to the company's restatement of earnings in 2005. The settlement money is intended to cover those who bought stock in the company between 1999 and 2005.

<p>This settlement is the latest among many lawsuits that have been brought against AIG in recent years. In September 2010 a class-action case moved forward against former AIG chief executive Martin Sullivan, former executive for AIG's subsidiary Joseph Cassano and multiple other former chief and senior executives among accusations of <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-aid-fraud-suit.php">fraudulent intent to mislead the market</a> [JURIST report] and failing to disclose to its shareholders the risks the company was taking in issuing sub-prime mortgages. In May 2010 the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] decided <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/doj-drops-criminal-probe-of-aig-exec.php">not to file charges</a> [JURIST report] against Cassano, ending a two-year criminal investigation of several executives from AIG's Financial Products subsidiary, which played a large role in constructing complex contracts known as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1723152,00.html">credit-default swaps</a> [TIME backgrounder] that insured bond losses tied to the US housing market. The <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] investigation was undertaken to determine whether AIG officials deceived investors and auditors in 2007 by misrepresenting the accounting value of a credit default swap portfolio, which nearly bankrupted the company. In 2009, former AIG executives <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/former-aig-executives-settle-sec.php">agreed to settle</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21170.pdf">suit </a>[complaint, PDF] brought by the SEC alleging their involvement in inflating the company's reported financial records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Independent Expert Rita Izsak explained that the African Commission needs to implement a systematic solution for ensuring that the concerns of minorities across Africa are addressed. Izsak urged governments to act and protect the most vulnerable segments of the population in Africa. Izsak discussed her work as the head of the UN Forum on Minority Issues and also encouraged non governmental organizations (NGOs) to take part in future meetings and forums. Izsak stated that linguistic and religious minorities are entitled to protection under the UN Declaration on Minorities. The expert stated that "The ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity must be recognized as enriching the society and its historical heritage and be protected and promoted to the full extent possible." She explained that protecting the rights of minorities will reduce tension in the region and promote stability.

<p>In January, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon told an African Union summit that the leaders in Africa must <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-sg-urges-africa-countries-to-lower-poverty-and-violence-accelerate-development.php">increase efforts</a> [JURIST report] to lower poverty levels, end cycles of violence and accelerate development. Ban noted that while many countries have made strides to achieve the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), he expressed concern about the millions of Africans living in poverty and urged African leaders to reach the MDGs before the 2015 deadline. Regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/mali-security-forces-killing-civilians-in-small-town-hrw.php">ongoing crisis</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13881370">Mali </a>[BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">news archive</a>], Ban said the international community had a "moral imperative" to assist civilians in need. To obtain results, Ban said Africa needed resources for high-impact interventions; innovative technologies and integrated services; increased investments in women and girls; advance all the MDGs; improve education; address hunger; and overcome poverty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The artifacts include painted masks and headdresses that are said to be sacred among the Hopi tribe. Historians, along with many Hopi tribe members, believe that the items were illegally obtained, though the auction house insists that they were purchased legally over decades by a US collector. An additional last-minute appeal was made to Council of Sales, the regulator for the French auction market, but they declined to intervene. After the ruling, the action house, <a href="http://www.neret-tessier.com/index.jsp?setLng=en">Neret-Minet</a> [website], proceeded to organize what is to be one of the largest sales of Hopi artifacts, and is expected to bring in an estimated $1 million. 

<p>Courts continue to grapple with many Native American legal issues, in addition to the repatriation of artifacts. In June 2009, US authorities charged 24 individuals with <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/us-authorities-charge-24-with-theft-of.php">looting Native American artifacts</a> [JURIST report] from public land in violation of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf">Archaeological Resource Protection Act </a>(ARPA) [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nagpra/MANDATES/25USC3001etseq.htm">Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act</a> (NAGPRA) [text] in connection with the theft of 256 artifacts worth $335,685.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Islamabad High Court also ordered Musharraf to post bond for Rs 500,000, or just over USD $5,000, and to <a href="http://dawn.com/2013/04/12/ihc-approves-interim-bail-for-musharraf/">appear for his next hearing</a> [Dawn report] scheduled for April 18. Musharraf has been named as a suspect in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassination</a> [JURIST report] of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>] in 2007. He is also wanted in connection with the murder of a Baluch tribal leader Nawab Akbar Bugti in 2007. 

<p>This is the latest development in Musharraf's continued legal troubles in Pakistan. This week the Pakistan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-supreme-court-delays-musharraf-treason-hearing.php">delayed his treason hearing</a> [JURIST report] until early next week to give Musharraf's lawyers enough time to prepare a response to the allegations. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011 Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for the former president but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve the warrant</a> [JURIST report] because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2008 then-govenor Wulff reportedly <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-04-12/ex-german-president-charged-with-corruption/">accepted</a> [AP report] approximately &#8364;4000 (USD $5000) from German film producer David Groenewold to cover hotel bills during a holiday visit to the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich. In return Wulff allegedly lobbied for financial support from German-company <a href="http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/">Siemens AG</a> [corporate website] on Groenewold's behalf before being selected as president in 2010. In 2012 Wulff resigned from office in the midst of further corruption accusations. According to media sources, Wulff <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22125592">denies the allegations</a> [BBC report] and seeks to disprove the charges in court after rejecting an offer in March to settle the case by paying fines. Groenewold has also been charged with bribery.

<p>German <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/De/Homepage/home.html">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website, in German] selected Wulff to fill the largely ceremonial role of president in 2010. In 2011 German media sources accused Wulff of accepting a &#8364;500,000 (USD $650,000) low interest home loan from the wife of German businessman Egon Geerkens. Wulff reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17072479">gave false statements</a> [BBC report] about the loan in front of parliament, leading to his resignation in February 2012. Corruption has been an issue in Germany in the past. In January 2007 Germany <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/germany-to-toughen-anti-corruption-law.php">introduced draft legislation</a> [JURIST report] to tighten anti-corruption laws on the heels of scandals at Volkswagen AG and Siemens AG. The law sought to increase public prosecutors' power to investigate corruption of a broader range of implicated employees, and to allow employees of foreign corporations to be indicted in Germany. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Through the amendments Turkey will <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/thomson-reuters/130412/turkey-passes-anti-terrorism-law-reform">narrow its definition of terrorism propaganda</a> [Reuters report]. Amendments to Article 6 envisage punishment for people who propagate or publish declarations of an illegal organizations only if the content legitimizes or encourages acts of violence, threats or force, and also clarify that publishers of such declarations are not automatically deemed members of the illegal organization making the declaration. Over the years, Turkey has <a href="http://www.kolotv.com/news/internationalnews/headlines/Turkey-Amends-Anti-Terror-Laws-to-Amend-Rights-202586061.html">prosecuted numerous politicians, reporters and activists</a> [AP report] through its broad-reaching terrorism legislation. 

<p>In February, the Council of Europe <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/council-of-europe-urges-turkey-to-speed-up-legislation-reform.php">urged Turkey to move more quickly</a> [JURIST report] in its efforts to reform the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism, and the pressing need for action. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website] criticized Turkey in November for <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST report] under the country's vague counterterrorism law. In March 2011 a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Turkish officials to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-urges-turkish-government-to-respect-freedom-of-expression.php">respect journalists' freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2010 a Turkish Magistrate Court in Ankara <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/turkish-court-reinstates-ban-on-youtube.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] the nearly three-year ban on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [media website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=youtube">news archive</a>] only days after the ban had been lifted. The court ordered access to YouTube blocked after video of former opposition leader Deniz Baykal in a bedroom with a female aide surfaced on the site. In September 2010 the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/europe-rights-court-rules-turkey-failed-to-protect-murdered-journalist-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey failed to protect the life of well-known Turkish-Armenian writer and journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>] and failed to adequately investigate his murder and infringed on his right of freedom of expression.

Prior to his death, Dink was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/turkish-editor-gets-six-month-jail.php">tried</a> and then put on <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/journalist-faces-retrial-for-insulting.php">retrial</a> [JURIST report] for "insulting Turkishness" by writing about the killing of Armenians during the Ottoman Empire.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/">Executive Office for Immigration Review</a> [official website] issued the ruling in August, ordering the deportation of Vides for crimes against humanity. He is accused of participating in extrajudicial killings during El Salvador's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder]. A judge found last April that Vides <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-immigration-judge-rules-former-el-salvador-general-may-be-deported.php">could be deported</a> [JURIST report] based on the charges leveled against him. The ruling released on Friday confirms the earlier decision and orders Vides' removal from the US to El Salvador.  

<p>The Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged Vides</a> [JURIST report] in April 2012 with human rights crimes and sought to deport him. He had been living in Florida since the conclusion of his term as defense minister in 1988. In 2006, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">upheld a $55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against him and another former Salvadoran general, Jose Guillermo Garcia, in a civil suit for torture and human rights violations. The verdict had previously been thrown out for failure to file within the 10-year statute of limitations but was reinstated because of "extraordinary circumstances." In 2000, however, the US <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">lost in a jury trial</a> [NYT report] when attempting to prosecute Vides and Garcia for the killing of the four American women in 1980. After that case, one juror explained that they did not believe the generals were directly responsible for the killings or that they could have done anything to stop them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.senat.fr/espace_presse/actualites/201302/le_mariage_ouvert_aux_couples_de_personnes_du_meme_sexe_examen_au_senat.html">bill</a> [text, in French] will return in May to the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/">National Assembly</a> [official website] for final approval, and would then become law this summer. The approval comes just a week after the Senate's <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-senate-debates-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption.php">debate commenced</a> [JURIST report]. The Socialist party of <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French] holds a strong majority in the lower house, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/france-lawmakers-approve-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an earlier version of the text in February. This legislation was a keynote campaign pledge by the president and is one of France's most prominent social reforms. France would join 12 countries, half of which are in Europe, where same-sex marriage has been legalized. The bill has not come without opposition, however, as France remains largely Roman Catholic with strong conservative convictions. Many opponents are rallying under a movement called <a href="http://www.lamanifpourtous.fr/">La Manif Pour Tous</a> [advocacy website, in French], with hundreds of thousands of people marching and protesting in Paris and throughout the country. Most opposition is against same-sex couple adoption rather than marriage. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue across the globe recently. Last week, Uruguay's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted 23-8</a> [JURIST report] in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill creates one law covering marriage for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Last month the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the second of two cases the court heard that week on same-sex marriage. In that argument, the court considered the validity of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law that recognizes only opposite-sex marriages for federal benefits purposes, despite state law on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and life sentence and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, although their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">were charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud, using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill amends the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s2038pcs/pdf/BILLS-112s2038pcs.pdf">Stop Insider Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act</a> (STOCK Act) [S 2030, PDF] to remove many senior government officials from the reporting requirements on the grounds that the posting of financial information <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/293597-congress-quietly-repeals-financial-transparency-rules-for-government-officials">could be a national security risk </a> [The Hill report].

The bill, which passed unanimously in both the House and Senate, now goes to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile]. 

<p>The STOCK Act has been the subject of legal controversy since it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/president-obama-signs-bill-banning-insider-trading-by-lawmakers.php">signed into law in April 2012</a> [JURIST report]. In September a judge for the <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of Maryland</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-blocks-congressional-insider-trading-law.php">blocked the enactment of the STOCK Act</a> [JURIST report], ruling that it violated government officials' right to privacy. The challenge to the act was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/aclu-challenges-congressional-insider-trading-law.php">filed in August</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the senior federal executives and various professional organizations by the <a href="http://aclu-nca.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of the Nation's Capitol</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The complaint notes that the financial information at issue is "precisely the information that foreign intelligence services and other adversaries spend billions of dollars every years to uncover" and that the "complete personal financial information of all senior officials on the Internet would be a jackpot for enemies of the United States intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit." The legislation was originally introduced by <a href="http://www.louise.house.gov/">Congresswoman Louise Slaughter</a> [official website] in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Burkina Faso is particularly vulnerable due to its geographical proximity to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">conflict in northern Mali</a> [JURIST news archives], with which it shares a border. Emmerson described the country's role in peace negotiations within the region, stating: <blockquote>Burkina Faso plays a critical role in promoting peace and dialogue within the sub-region. It will almost certainly occupy an important mediating position in the forthcoming negotiations concerning the future of Mali, and will significantly contribute to the maintenance of any settlement that is reached.</blockquote> There are additional sources of tension within the country which could contribute to radicalization and extremism, high unemployment and poverty in particular. The country faces unemployment rates reaching <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2129rank.html">as high as 77%</a> [CIA world factbook], and nearly half the population falls beneath the poverty line. 

<p>The primary source of concern for Burkina Faso is the ongoing conflict in northern Mali. Mali has drawn international scrutiny recently as more reports of political violence and human rights abuses come to light. In March, Malian Tuareg rebels called on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mali-rebels-call-for-icc-investigation.php">investigate alleged war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed by Malian government forces during the conflict. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the Malian government to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mali-should-prosecute-soldiers-for-abuses-hrw.php">prosecute soldiers</a> [JURIST report] who have allegedly participated in torture, summary executions and enforced disappearances against suspected Islamist rebels and their supporters. Earlier that month, the UN deployed a fact-finding mission to Mali to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-sends-team-to-investigate-human-rights-violations-in-mali.php">investigate potential violations</a> [JURIST report] of humanitarian law in the form of retaliatory violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was approved by the North Dakota Senate by a margin of 30-17 in February, and <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/governor-jack-dalrymple">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] has indicated that he <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/apr/12/us-xgr-abortion-north-dakota/">intends to sign</a> [AP report] the so-called "fetal pain" bill. Dalrymple has already signed into law <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-restrictive-abortion-laws.php">several measures restricting abortions</a> [JURIST report], including: banning abortions as soon as a heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks into a pregnancy; banning abortions for the purpose of gender selection or genetic abnormalities; and requiring that any physician performing an abortion have admitting and staff privileges at a nearby hospital.

<p>A number of other states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier, Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://rt.com/news/guantanamo-bay-hunger-strike-399/">hunger strike</a> [RT timeline], which has been ongoing since February, is a protest against indefinite detainment and the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/us-guantanamo-hunger-strike-824/">confiscation and unreasonable searches</a> [RT report] of detainees' personal items. A US <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/04/08/3330181/guantanamo-notifying-lawyers-for.html">military official said</a> [AP report] that the government's policy previously was to avoid discussing any prisoner by name, but lawyers said they are now being notified if their clients are among those being force-fed through a tube to prevent dangers to their health from weight loss. The government reported that as of Monday that 42 prisoners were participating in the hunger strike and 11 were being force-fed, but prisoners' lawyers report that these numbers are much higher. The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] also reported on Sunday that detainees are <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119772">being moved to single-cell living</a> [press release] in order for the government to increase monitoring of them, and will be medically assessed in response to the hunger strike.

<p>The hunger strike has stoked controversy between human rights lawyers and Guantanamo officials about whether prisoners are being provided with sufficient necessities to avoid health issues. Last month, lawyers for one Guantanamo detainee filed an <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-human-rights-attorneys-on.php">emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] alleging that Guantanamo guards were failing to provide prisoners with sufficient drinking water and clothing. The lawyers alleged that this treatment was being used to undermine the inmates, and attached a report by a psychiatrist concluding that the hunger strike combined with a lack of sufficient water could have serious health implications. Earlier that month, lawyers for some inmates along with the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to a rear admiral describing invasions of privacy and harsh conditions suffered by detainees, as well as the means of protest they have used, including the hunger strike. The lawyers just learned of these conditions after a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php">ruled that they could visit</a> [JURIST report] their clients at the camp for the first time in February.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This ruling allows the Indian government to continue a trend toward use of execution that began in November after a de facto moratorium on its use since 2004. The government had a policy beginning in 2004 of only using the death penalty in <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/executions-on-the-rise-as-india-walks-away-from-nineyear-moratorium-20130413-2hs7s.html">extremely rare cases</a> [Sydney Morning Herald report], which led to its not being used at all until last year. Bhullar was convicted of planting a bomb in 1993 which killed nine people and injured 25 in New Delhi, and the court ruled that this met the criteria of being an extremely rare case which warranted use of the death penalty. He will be the third prisoner to be executed since the moratorium ended.

<p>India's return to use of the death penalty has been controversial. In February Afzal Guru, who was convicted of participation in an attack on India's parliament in 2001, became the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/india-parliament-attack-plotter-executed-after-president-refuses-to-grant-clemency.php">second prisoner to be executed</a> [JURIST report] since its end. Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving shooter in the 2008 <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+terror+attack">Mumbai terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], became the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/india-executes-sole-surviving-gunman-from-2008-mumbai-attacks.php">first in November</a> [JURIST report]. The country's high court had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/india-high-court-affirms-death-sentence-for-gunman-in-mumbai-attacks.php">upheld his sentence</a> in August, despite concerns that he had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/india-court-rejects-mumbai-terror.php">not received a fair trial</a> [JURIST reports]. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] had urged the government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/india-urged-to-stop-executions.php">stop his execution</a> [JURIST report] months earlier, stating that it would cause India to move backward in a trend toward abolition of the death penalty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The SEC alleges that London's insider tips allowed Shaw to make more than $1.2 million in illicit profits. In exchange for the tips, Shaw paid London at least $50,000 in cash, a Rolex watch and other jewelry, meals, and event tickets. The SEC's complaint charges London and Shaw with violations of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint asks for London and Shaw to return ill-gotten gains and pay prejudgment interest and financial penalties, and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/">U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California</a> [official website] the same day <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/cac/Pressroom/2013/049.html">announced</a> [press release] criminal charges against London for conspiracy to commit securities fraud through insider trading, which carries a statutory maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

<p>This is not the first time a current or former KPMG employee has been under fire. In 2007 US District Judge Lewis Kaplan <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissed charges</a> against 13 of 16 defendants in a <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/new-criminal-indictments-filed-against.php">criminal tax shelters case</a> [JURIST reports] against former employees of the accounting firm KPMG, ruling that federal prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/federal-prosecutors-violated-kpmg.php">violated the constitutional rights of the defendants</a> [JURIST report] by pressuring KPMG not to pay for the defendants' legal fees. KPMG had admitted the tax shelters were illegal and has taken full responsibility for the <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/kpmg-to-pay-153-million-to-former.php">unlawful conduct</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2005 KPMG agreed to pay the US <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] a <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/kpmg-reaches-456-million-settlement-to.php">$456 million fine</a> [JURIST report] to avoid criminal prosecution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The attack, resulting in at least <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/death-toll-rises-35-somalia-court-attack-091204255.html">35 deaths</a> [AP report], was one of the worst attacks in years for the country's capital of Mogadishu. According to the Somali government, nine men were involved in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22153911">attack</a> [BBC report] against the court, six of whom detonated explosive vests. Al-Shabab retained control over most of Somalia's capital before Somali forces and the <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] forced al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu in 2011. Since being forced out of the capital, al-Shabaab has carried out a series of bomb attack in the city, with Sunday's coordinated attack amounting to the largest one since 2011. The Somali government reported that all of the attackers died, with some killed by security forces.

<p>Recently, Somalia has come under criticism for human rights violations. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported last month that displaced people in Somalia face the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/displaced-people-in-somalia-face-abuse-and-rape-hrw.php">risk of physical abuse</a> [JURIST report] and rape. HRW noted that the threat of beatings and rape from internal security forces was significant and called for the practices to end. According to HRW, "Instead of finding a safe haven from fighting and famine, many displaced Somalis who came to Mogadishu have found hostility and abuse." Earlier in March, a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICJ <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4871.pdf">awarded</a> [judgment, PDF] the temple to the Cambodian city of Phnom Penh in 1962. However, parts of the Cambodia-Thailand border have never been formally demarcated, resulting in violent military clashes since 2008. Cambodia's ownership of the temple itself has never been <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/345501/cambodia-thailand-begin-argument-before-icj-on-disputed-area-near-preah-vihear">contested</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report], but both nations lay claim to a 4.6 square kilometer patch of land on the joint border reportedly not covered by the ICJ's ruling. Thailand has long argued that the ICJ does not have jurisdiction to decide the border dispute. However, in April 2011 the Cambodian government <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/cambodia-asks-icj-to-review-disputed-temple-on-thailand-border.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to clarify the 1962 ruling in order to "peacefully and definitely settle the boundary problem..." after a series of violent clashes left 28 dead. In response, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5218">stressed</a> [statement] that the dispute could not be resolved through military force and urged both sides to work towards a ceasefire. In July 2011 the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ICJ-orders-thailand-cambodia-to-withdraw-troops-from-world-border-temple.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] both nations to immediately withdraw military personnel from the disputed area, however, both nations delayed replacing soldiers with police and security guards until July 2012. The ICJ is expected to rule on the dispute in October. 

<p>The area surrounding the Temple of Preah Vihear has been <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=284&code=ct&p1=3&p2=3&case=45&k=46&p3=5">contested</a> [ICJ backgrounder] for more than a century, dating back to maps drawn after French colonial disengagement in the early 1900's. The temple, now partially in ruins, stands on a promontory of the Dangrek mountain range, which generally constitutes the boundary between Cambodia and Thailand. The dispute first arose between French settlements involved with Indo-China, and the Siam government. The parties entered into various treaties attempting to delimit the border along the mountain range, one of which placed the temple itself in Cambodia. By the 1950's, the Thai government had yet to contest the delimitation, and continued to publish maps placing the temple in Cambodia. The ICJ thus affirmed Cambodia's sovereignty over the temple in 1962. Cambodia's border with Vietnam has also been a point of controversy. In 2011, Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy lost his final appeal in the Cambodian Supreme Court on <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-group-criticizes-cambodia.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of intentionally destroying posts marking the Cambodia-Vietnam border and inciting racial discrimination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW's concerns are in response to UAE authorities' crack-down on domestic dissent and freedom of expression, as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uae-begins-trial-of-94-activists-charged-in-alleged-coup-plot.php">ongoing mass trial</a> [JURIST report] of 94 peaceful critics of the government.

<p>Last month the UAE began the trial of 94 people charged with plotting to overthrow the government. The group of defendants includes <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/04/uae-trial-coup-plot">unnamed doctors, academics, lawyers and other professionals</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] arrested over the past year and accused of forming a secret network with ties to the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">news archive</a>] and designs to raise money in a plotted coup against Emirati ruling families. UAE authorities began arresting al-Islah members last March, when security forces arrested Ahmed al-Zaabi, a former judge, and Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi together at a Dubai gas station. They detained the chairman of al-Islah, Sheikh Sultan Bin Kayed al-Qasimi, on April 20. Since last year both Amnesty International and HRW have called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-calls-on-uae-to-investigate-claims-of-torture.php">investigate allegations of torture</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST reports] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, he will <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/04/2013415134713761409.html">remain in custody</a> [Aljazeera report] until his fraud charges are adjudicated. Mubarak was originally sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] after being found guilty of charges related to the killing of protesters during a 2011 uprising.

The judge did not state his reasoning for a new trial, however the initial trial judge made it clear during the trial in June that the prosecution lacked hard evidence to support the conviction. The new trial began on Saturday and ended just minutes later when Judge Mostafa Hassan Abdallah <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">recused himself</a> [JURIST report], further delaying the justice process and aggravating citizens who are already suspicious of the justice system. 

<p>Mubarak and members of his former government have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the start of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and life sentence and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million.

The controversial case focused on several comments Say made through <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> [media website]. Say's lawyers contend that Say did not intend to insult religion and that he made no open call to violence. The court was unconvinced and hinged their decision on the public forum Say used to share his opinions. The court suspended the sentence and allowed Say to remain free, but he will be subjected to prison time if he commits a similar offense within five years. 

<p>Say's conviction has incited reactions from artists and human rights groups around the world. Turkish author <a href="https://twitter.com/Elif_Safak">Elif Safak</a> [media profile] responded to Say's conviction on Twitter, saying "I am deeply surprised and saddened to hear about the sentence given to well-known pianist Fazil Say." <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/turkey-time-remove-shackles-freedom-2013-03-27">statement</a> [press release] last month that said "the right to freedom of expression is under attack in Turkey.

Myriad Genetics, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-gene-patent-case.php">report</a>], which deals with the issue of whether human genes are patentable. <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website] patented two genes, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/brca">BRCA1 and BRCA2</a> [NCI backgrounder], which are isolated genes&#8212;different from native genes because the process of extracting them changes their molecular structure but not their genetic code. Counsel for the <a href="http://www.amp.org/">Association for Molecular Pathology</a> (AMP) [advocacy website] argued that Myriad has not invented anything: "the genes themselves, ... where they start and stop, what they do, what they are made of, and what happens when they go wrong are all decisions that were made by nature, not by Myriad." AMP argued that although isolated or extracted natural products are patentable, there must be some further manipulation of the product so that it is no longer as it exists in nature. Myriad, AMP asserts, has not done any further manipulation and is simply trying to patent a natural product of nature. AMP also argued against the idea that if companies could not patent genes, then they would not invest the required amount of money to further research:<blockquote>the whole point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from innovating and&#8212;and making new discoveries. That's the reason we have the product of nature doctrine, is because there may be a million things you can do with the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is allowed to look at it and that is impeding science rather than advancing it.</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that all Myriad had done was take a sequence of naturally occurring molecules snipping off the top and bottom. In response, Myriad analogized its process of isolating genes was akin to a baseball bat. A baseball bat does not exist until it is "isolated" from the tree and it takes human ingenuity and intervention to decide where to start and stop cutting the tree to form the bat. Similarly, the isolated genes exist only as a part of a whole DNA genome and deciding where to start and stop cutting the DNA so as to isolate the gene involves the requisite level of human intervention to qualify for patent protection. Commentators have suggested that counsel for Myriad <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/04/argument-recap-analogies-to-the-rescue/">struggled</a> [SCOTUSblog report] to properly analogize Myriad's product to other patentable products.

<p>The Supreme Court also heard oral arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-167-asc7.pdf">United States v. Davila</a> [transcript, PDF], which addresses whether any degree of judicial involvement in plea negotiations merits automatic reversal in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_11">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCRMP) Rule 11(c)(1)</a> [text], regardless of whether the judicial involvement actually prejudiced the defendant. Davila was charged with filing over 130 false tax returns in the name of Florida inmates. During an ex parte hearing with the judge where Davila was seeking to discharge his lawyer, the judge urged Davila to plead guilty to the charges. FRCRMP Rule 11(c)(1) specifically forbids judges from participating in plea negotiations, but commentators thought that the court would <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/04/should-judicial-participation-in-plea-discussions-be-automatically-reversible-no-pressure-if-the-justices-stick-to-the-question-presented/">likely rule against Davila</a> [SCOTUSblog report]. Some of the justices expressed concern that if Rule 11(c)(1) was applied maximally, then minor actions of the judge could be used as an argument that the judge was influencing the negotiations and therefore be a basis for voiding a guilty plea. Counsel for the US argued that significant violations of Rule 11(c)(1), such as a judge pressuring the government outside of the defendant's presence to offer a plea, must be distinguished from minor violations, such as a judge indicating too strongly what type of new plea deal he would be willing to accept after rejecting the initial plea deal. Counsel for the US further argued that applying the rule too rigidly would trap judges in a corner where they couldn't guard against later ineffective assistance of counsel claims by discussing plea deals with the defendants because it would risk automatic reversal as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation. Counsel for Davila argued that this was not a trivial matter and that the judge had "abandoned his role as neutral arbiter and fundamentally distorted the pretrial process." Because of the judge's unique position as a alleged neutral arbiter, any influence that he has on the plea negotiation process is magnified and it puts an incredible amount of pressure on defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 46 of the <a href="https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Bhunreacht_na_hEireann_web.pdf">Irish Constitution</a> [text, PDF] provides that any major constitutional change must be ratified by the electorate. Presently, civil partnerships are recognized and afforded some rights under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/pdf/2010/en.act.2010.0024.PDF">Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010</a> [text, PDF] but are not equal to civil marriage. Article 41 of the Irish Constitution "recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law," and guarantees its protection by the state, but these rights and protections are not extended to single parents, unmarried opposite-sex co-habiters, and same-sex couples.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue across the globe recently. Last week France's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/french-senate-backs-same-sex-marriage.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a same-sex marriage bill that would allow same-sex couples to wed and adopt children. The bill will return in May to the National Assembly for final approval, and could become law this summer. Earlier this month, Uruguay's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted 23-8</a> [JURIST report] in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage. The bill creates one law covering marriage for both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Last month the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the second of two cases the court heard that week on same-sex marriage. In that argument, the court considered the validity of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law that recognizes only opposite-sex marriages for federal benefits purposes, despite state law on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">unanimously upheld the results</a> [JURIST report] last month but just released its reasoning, finding that the process was flawed but not illegal. The results of the March 4 election, in which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21544245">President Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Uhuru+Kenyatta">news archive</a>] won by 50.7 percent of the vote, were challenged by former prime minister <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. The court held that the evidence did not show "any profound irregularity in the management of the electoral process" or that Kenyatta had not obtained the basic vote-threshold. According to the court's ruling:<blockquote>We take judicial notice that Kenya, thanks to the relentlessness of the people's democratic struggles, has recently enacted for herself the current Constitution, which assures for every citizen an opportunity for personal security and for self-actualization in a free environment. The Judiciary in general, and this Supreme Court in particular, has a central role in the protection of that Constitution and in the realization of its fruits so these may inure to all within our borders; and in the exercise of that role, we choose to keep our latitude of judicial authority unclogged: so the Supreme Court may be trusted to have a watchful eye over the play of the Constitution in the fullest sense.</blockquote>The court concluded that this was a unique case at a crucial historical moment.

<p>In March Odinga <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appealed the results</a> of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">Kenya's 2013 election</a> [JURIST reports] to Kenya's Supreme Court. Later that month Kenya's Supreme Court ruled that the results of the country's presidential election were valid. Kenyatta is currently facing charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for violence during the 2007 election. Earlier in March Kenyatta's lawyer asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him for lack of evidence, but the prosecution refused. Kenyatta's request was based on the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1568411.pdf">withdrawal</a> [decision, PDF] of charges against co-defendant Francis Muthaura for lack of evidence. Kenyatta's lawyers claimed the evidence against Muthaura and Kenyatta was the same, but the prosecution disagreed. Kenyatta's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php#">previously postponed</a> [JURIST report], and it will begin on July 9.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October after a public speech was found to contain remarks detrimental to the "social and political balance of the country." The remarks came during a boycott movement led by Barrak <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/kuwait-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-for-emir-insult/2013/04/15/5de552ce-a5a3-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html">against a controversial election law</a> [AP report] that the opposition claims is illegal and will establish a rubber stamp parliament. Violent protests erupted after Barrak was arrested last October, and there is concern that the verdict will again spark unrest. Barrak's sentencing comes a week after a report that the Kuwaiti government has begun to <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-04-10/business/38415063_1_emir-traditional-media-online-posts">consider a media law</a> [AP report] that could bring fines up to one million US dollars for insulting the Emir or the ruling family.    

<p>Kuwait's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/kuwait-constitutional-court-upholds-controversial-election-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the election law in September. In August, leaders of the political opposition in Kuwait <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kuwait-opposition-leaders-criticize-government-challenge-to-election-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the government's efforts to change the country's election law through the Constitutional Court, saying the government was attempting to seize power through the court in violation of the constitution. The government announced in August that they had asked the national Constitutional Court to review the legality of the country's election law. In June the Constitutional Court ruled that last year's election for the new parliament was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kuwait-court-invalidates-current-and-reinstates-former-parliament.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and the previous parliament of 2009 should be reinstated, thereby removing the opposition-controlled parliament and restoring a more government-friendly body.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appellate tribunal threw out his nomination because he <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/04/2013416103441625181.html">violated the constitution</a> [Al-Jazeera report] in 2007 by imposing emergency rule on the nation. Musharraf plans to appeal the ruling in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>This is the latest development in Musharraf's continued legal troubles in Pakistan. Last week, a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended the bail</a> [JURIST report] granted to Musharraf, who faces charges of detaining judges during his time in office. Also last week, the country's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-supreme-court-delays-musharraf-treason-hearing.php">delayed his treason hearing</a> [JURIST report] until early next week to give his lawyers enough time to prepare a response to the allegations. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>  [advocacy website]<a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Pakistani authorities last year <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] him for his alleged involvement in the assassination of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>].

Under the legislation, an undocumented immigrant would have the opportunity to become classified as a "Registered Provisional Immigrant" on the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/16/senate-immigration-bill/2086369/">path to legal status or citizenship</a> [USA Today report] if he or she has maintained a physical presence in the US since December 31, 2011, passes a criminal background check and pays $500 plus any outstanding taxes. The bill also allocates approximately $3 billion to increase manpower and resources along the nation's 1,969-mile southwest border and an additional $1.5 billion to add to the 651 miles of existing fencing along that border. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Tuesday called the bill a step forward, but <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights-technology-and-liberty/aclu-lens-aclu-responds-gang-8-immigration-plan">criticized the legislation</a> [press release] for having too many obstacles for those who committed minor crimes or cannot afford the fines required to start the path to legal status or citizenship. Republican members of Congress have also criticized the bill for allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain citizenship before securing of the border is accomplished.

<p>Immigration reform has been a recent focus for the US government. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> [official website] and unions <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/Bipartisan-US-senate-group-reaches-agreement-on-immigration-reform.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] regarding the guest worker program, which would provide a pathway for undocumented immigrants to become US citizens. The bill was allowed to proceed to its final stages of drafting following this agreement. In February, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">White House</a> [official website] drafted a proposal that would allow immigrants to become <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/white-house-immigration-reform-draft-would-create-new-path-to-citizenship-report.php">legal permanent residents</a> [JURIST report] in eight years and reportedly would also increase security funding, require business owners to check the immigration status of new hires within four years and create a new "Lawful Prospective Immigrant" visa program. Under this bill, if approved for the new visa, immigrants could also apply for the same status for spouses and children who live outside the US. Approved immigrants would be allowed to reside legally in the US for four years, obtain work and leave the country for brief time periods.</p>

<p>4/17/13 ~ The <a href="http://www.schumer.senate.gov/forms/immigration.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] was released early Wednesday morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttorture.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US authorities have engaged in the torture of detainees, and the nation's "highest officials" bear some of the responsibility, according to a <a href="http://detaineetaskforce.org/pdf/Full-Report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released on Tuesday by the <a href="http://www.constitutionproject.org/">Constitution Project</a> [advocacy website], a bi-partisan legal advocacy and watchdog group. The <a href="http://detaineetaskforce.org/">Task Force on Detainee Treatment</a> [advocacy website] was established after US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] announced in 2009 that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/white-house-opposes-independent-truth.php">opposed</a> [JURIST report] a proposal by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/biography/">Patrick Leahy</a> [official profile] to set up a "truth commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/senate-judiciary-chair-leahy-calls-for.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] controversial actions of the Bush administration, including justifications for the Iraq War, warrantless wiretapping and detainee treatment. The task force members reached their conclusions after a two-year process, which included examination of public records and interviews with former detainees, military and intelligence officers, interrogators, and policymakers. 

<p>The first conclusion by the task force, that the US engaged in torture, is based on historical and legal precedents as to what constitutes torture. According to the UN <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> (CAT) [text], which has been ratified by the US, torture is any act "by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes of obtaining ... information or a confession." Though the Bush administration <a href="http://media.luxmedia.com/aclu/olc_08012002_bybee.pdf">concluded</a> [memo, PDF] that certain acts, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and facial slapping, do not constitute torture, the commission pointed to US court cases that determined such acts to constitute torture and to instances where the US has defined those acts as torture when performed by other governments around the world.</p>

<p>The second conclusion, that the US officials at the highest levels are partially responsible for "allowing and contributing to the spread of torture," is based on a number of decisions made by the Bush administration following the 9/11 attacks. One is an order <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/38727.htm">issued</a> [press release] by President George W. Bush in 2002, which found that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the conflict with al Qaeda. According to the commission, this decision, along with authorization of enhanced interrogation techniques and the establishment of numerous detention facilities, contributed to inhumane treatment of detainees. The commission concluded that these decisions, without subsequent clarification as to what rules would apply to al Qaeda detainees, resulted in an attitude among many lower-level troops that "the gloves were off" regarding treatment of prisoners and ultimately contributed to the use and spread of torture.</p>

<p>Since the attacks of <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder], the US has engaged in a number of controversial policies with respect to the conflict with al Qaeda. The increased use of unmanned drone strikes against suspected terrorist suspects by the Obama administration has been criticized by US <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">lawmakers</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-expert-pakistan-condemns-us-drone-strikes.php">foreign countries</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">international organizations</a> [JURIST reports]. Additionally, the treatment of detainees at the <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been controversial. Recently, the practice of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guantanamo-prisoners-lawyers-notified-of-force-feeding.php">force-feeding detainees</a> [JURIST report] participating in a hunger strike in order to protest indefinite detention and inhumane treatment has come under public scrutiny. In 2011, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/patriot-act-extended-through-2015.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a four-year re-authorization of the the Patriot Act, which allows the government to use roving wiretaps on electronic devices and to gain access to certain records relevant to investigations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gamma International is a software company whose <a href= http://www.finfisher.com/FinFisher/en/index.php>FinFinisher software</a> [official website] has been used in 25 countries including Bahrain. FinFisher is a Trojan horse program that evades anti-virus utilities and monitors the user's keystrokes, data and Skype calls. Privacy International claims <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HM Revenue &#38; Customs</a> (HMRC) [official website] <a href= https://www.privacyinternational.org/press-releases/privacy-international-calls-on-hmrc-to-investigate-gamma-internationals-potential>acted unlawfully</a> [press release] by either misinterpreting the law to permit its activity or refusing to release the information without caution to the facts. For months, Privacy International lobbied for an investigation into Gamma International's activity. HMRC has opted not to comment on the suit due to legal reasons. Gamma International has denied selling FinFisher to Bahrain. 

<p>Bahrain's use of FinFisher software comes amid international scrutiny against Bahrain regarding its treatment of political prisoners. Last month, a court in Bahrain <a href=/paperchase/2013/03/bahrain-court-acquits-human-rights-activist.php>acquitted</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist <a href= https://twitter.com/SAIDYOUSIF>Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafda</a> [official Twitter] on charges of spreading false news to harm the country's security on <a href= https://twitter.com>Twitter</a> [media website]. In February, the Bahrain Higher Criminal Court acquitted two police officers in the shooting death of a Shiite protestor during the nation's pro-democracy protests in Manama that began in February 2011. The court concluded that the <a href=/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-court-acquits-2-policemen-in-protester-death.php>two police officers fired shots</a> [JURIST report] at Fadhel Matruk but did not intend to kill him. In December, Bahrain's High Criminal Court of Appeals <a href=/paperchase/2012/12/bahrain-appeals-court-overturns-jail-sentences-of-protestors.php>commuted death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two protestors, instead sentencing them to life imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A license revocation hearing with the state Department of Health was scheduled to take place 3 days after the ruling to hear arguments on the clinic's inability to attain the necessary admitting privileges. As a result of the ruling, the hearing will no longer be held. The ruling by <a href= http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/content/district-judge-daniel-p-jordan-iii>Judge Daniel P. Jordan III</a> [official website] also notes that the clinic sought the injunction because it had "exhausted all available avenues to comply" with the law prior to the hearing. The injunction also prohibits Mississippi from closing the clinic while a federal lawsuit challenging House Bill 1390 is still pending.

<p>The controversy surrounding House Bill 1390 and Mississippi's only abortion clinic has persisted for several years. In 2005, the Mississippi federal district court ruled that <a href=/paperchase/2005/06/federal-judge-declares-mississippi.php>Mississippi's law restricting abortions</a> [JURIST report] performed after the first-trimester violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Last June, the same abortion clinic in Mississippi filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href=/paperchase/2012/06/mississippi-abortion-clinic-sues-to-block-strict-abortion-law.php>challenging the regulation</a> [JURIST report] that was scheduled to go into effect. Last July, a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href=/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-blocks-mississippi-abortion-law.php>issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

McCutchen</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the terms of a contract in a health benefit plan should not be overturned through the application of equitable principles. The decision vacated and remanded the decision of the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/103836p.pdf">held</a> [opinion text] that Section 502(a)(3) of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-erisa.htm">Employee Retirement Income Security Act </a> (ERISA) [Department of Labor backgrounder] authorizes courts to use equitable principles to rewrite contractual language, even where the plan's terms give the employer an absolute right to reimbursement. The ruling today came nearly five months after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-erisa.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] were heard in November.

<p>The case centered around a US Airways employee whose medical expenses were paid by the airline after he was injured in a car accident. The terms of his health plan required that he reimburse US Airways for what it had paid if he recovered from a third-party. He did recover from the driver of the other car involved in his accident, but after paying attorneys fees, his net gain was less than US Airways had paid for his medical expenses. Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA allows the court to grant "appropriate equitable relief." The decision of the lower court granted equitable relief by refusing to require the employee to reimburse US Airways, but the Supreme Court held that the terms of the plan should govern. This ruling is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/11-1285">predicted to have the impact</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of reinforcing the viability of employee health plans, and thwarting a landslide of ERISA legislation that may have arisen if the court had upheld the lower court decision.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Symczyk</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-when-settlement-offer-moots-an-issue.php">report</a>] that the claim was <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/moot">moot</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because respondent "had no personal interest in representing putative, unnamed claimants, nor any other continuing interest that would preserve her suit from mootness." The original question presented concerned whether an issue at the center of a lawsuit is moot if an offer is made to settle with the potential plaintiff that fully covers the damages, whether or not the plaintiff accepts. The court did not rule on this question, but only settled the claim at hand, ruling that the original plaintiff, Laura Symczyk, and her colleagues, could no longer pursue class action status. Justice Clarence Thomas presented the opinion of the court:<blockquote>In this case, respondent's complaint requested statutory damages. Unlike claims for injunctive relief challenging ongoing conduct, a claim for damages cannot evade review; it remains live until it is settled, judicially resolved, or barred by a statute of limitations. Nor can a defendant's attempt to obtain settlement insulate such a claim from review, for a full settlement offer addresses plaintiff's alleged harm by making the plaintiff whole. While settlement may have the collateral effect of foreclosing unjoined claimants from having their rights vindicated in <em>respondent's</em> suit, such putative plaintiffs remain free to vindicate their rights in their own suits. They are no less able to have their claims settled or adjudicated following respondent's suit than if her suit had never been filed at all.</blockquote>The court <a href = "http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/103178p.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

<p>Justice Elena Kagan authored the dissent, criticizing the majority for not reaching the issue at question, calling the decision "the most one-off of one-offs." "The Court today resolves an imaginary question, based on a mistake the courts below made about this case and others like it. The issue here, the majority tells us, is whether a 'collective action' brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) 'is justiciable when the lone plaintiff's individual claim becomes moot.' Embedded within that question is a crucial premise: that the individual claim has become moot, as the lower courts held and the majority assumes without deciding. But what if that premise is bogus? What if the plaintiff's individual claim here never became moot?" Kagan further declared that "the Court chose to address an issue predicated on that misconception, in a way that aids no one, now or ever."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Baby Girl</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-to-hear-american-indian-adoption-case-2-others.php">report</a>] on who should have rightful custody of <A href = "http://www.saveveronica.org/">Baby Veronica</a> [adoptive parents' advocacy website; NICWA advocacy <a href = "http://www.nicwa.org/BabyVeronica/">website</a>] in light of the <a href = "http://www.nicwa.org/indian_child_welfare_act/">Indian Child Welfare Act</a> (ICWA) [text]. A non-Indian woman put her baby, who was fathered by an American Indian, up for adoption. A South Carolina couple attempted to adopt the child, but once the biological father was notified about the adoption proceedings, he attempted to gain custody. An attorney for the Adoptive Couple argued that it the courts have interpreted the ICWA too broadly in applying it to this case:<blockquote>[T]here's nothing in this Act that anyone can point to that was a basis for transferring custody to this father. At most, there is an obligation, an exhaustion obligation, that if a custodial parent has something like a drug abuse problem the State has to remediate before the family is broken up.
What is so extraordinary about this case, particularly the United States' position, is that the adoptive parents' failure to remediate a dad meant that the child got custody of the dad. So if this dad had had a drug problem, because there was no treatment of him the court held, well, that's a basis for giving the dad custody. But there's no language in the statute that even remotely suggests that it's a rights-creating provision. All of both of (d), (e), and (f) are protections that assume existing rights and then make it harder to terminate those rights.</blockquote>Paul Clement represented the appointed <a href = "http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Guardian+Ad+Litem">guardian <em>ad litem</em></a> [backgrounder], who favored Adoptive Couple's claim for custody. The attorney for Dustin Brown, the custodial father of Baby Girl, argued that ICWA allows that, barring Brown's inability to be a good father under the statute, his parental rights had to be terminated affirmatively, and as he is willing to father he should be allowed to. The Solicitor General supported Brown's claim: "What you have here are people who are citizens of two separate sovereigns. An Indian tribe is a sovereign and a State. Congress tried to accommodate those competing interests by leaving the cases in State court, letting them be subject to State law, but subject to minimum standards to protect the people who are citizens&#8212;or eligible for citizenship in the Indian tribe. That is a classic implementation of Congress's plenary responsibility in the Federal trust and guardianship for Indians, and nothing could be more at the core of tribal self-determination and tribal survival than the determination of tribal membership and the care about what happens to Indian children."

<p>The court also heard <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-798.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] in <a href = "/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-right-to-remain-silent-5-other-cases.php">American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles</a> [JURIST report] on whether the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/14501">49 USC &#167; 14501</a>(c)(1) [text] exemption permits a municipal governmental entity to take action that conflicts with the express preemption clause, if it occurs in a market in which the municipal entity does not participate, and is unconnected with any interest in the efficient procurement of services. An attorney for the <a href = "http://www.trucking.org/Pages/Home.aspx">American Trucking Association</a> [official website] argued that "[t]he Port is imposing binding standards of conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a channel of interstate commerce," impermissibly, through criminal penalties. An attorney for the city of Los Angeles argued that they were simply acting under the same standards as private entities. "They set forth conditions under which drayage trucks can enter the nonpublic portions of the Port, and they are indistinguishable, indistinguishable from contract provisions that private parties routinely impose on those who seek to enter their property. In our view, [49 USC &#167; 1450 (c)(1)] does not deal with contracts, and it doesn't deal with the right of landowners to condition those seeking entry into their Port."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/1/doc/11-3294p_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/1/hilite/">In Re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 (Asat Trust Reg., et al)</a> [opinion, PDF] the court upheld dismissals for a lack of personal jurisdiction over all but 12 of the 37 defendants. The defendants who were dismissed from the case included five relatives of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/osama-bin-laden-killed-leader-of-terrorist-group-al-qaeda-was-53/2010/09/21/AFqrZ0VF_story.html">Osama bin Laden</a> [WP obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bin+laden">news archive</a>]. The court remanded the case for the 12 defendants to whom the court found that personal jurisdiction did apply. The Second Circuit also upheld the dismissals against two defendants in <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/2/doc/11-3294f_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/2/hilite/">In Re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 (Saudi Joint Relief Comm., et al.)</a>  [opinion, PDF], as the court found that the <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/28/IV/97/1605">noncommercial tort exception</a> [text] to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> (FSIA) [text] did not apply to the defendants because the tortious acts allegedly committed by the defendants did not occur inside the USs. Finally, in <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/3/doc/11-3294r_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56cd7df3-0244-47b2-8a4d-382199a37c48/3/hilite/">In Re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001 (Al Rajhi Bank, et al.)</a>  [opinion, PDF], the Second Circuit upheld the dismissals against the defendants for a failure to state a claim for which the court could grant relief, specifically asserting that the defendants were not found to have owed a duty to the plaintiffs or to have proximately caused the harm to the plaintiffs.  

<p>Many cases involving suspected al Qaeda operatives and members of bin Laden's family are making their way through the US judicial system. Last week, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-sets-january-trial-date-for-bin-ladens-son-in-law.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, bin Laden's son-in-law, is scheduled for January 7, 2014. Ghaith <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bin-laden-son-in-law-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-of-al-qaeda-involvement.php">pleaded not guilty</a> on March 8, and was brought to the US on March 1 after his <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/son-in-law-of-bin-laden-to-appear-in-ny-federal-court.php">capture</a> [JURIST reports] in Jordan on February 28. In January the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">vacated the conspiracy conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul, bin Laden's media secretary.

The <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013">North Dakota House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-house-approves-fetal-pain-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill last Friday, and it was approved by the North Dakota Senate in February.

Dalrymple has already <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-restrictive-abortion-laws.php">signed several restrictive measures into law</a> [JURIST report], such as: banning abortions once a heartbeat can be detected, as early as six weeks; banning abortions based on gender selection or genetic abnormalities; and requiring that any physician performing an abortion have admitting and staff privileges at a nearby hospital.

<p>A number of other states have passed laws related to <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] recently. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier, Arkansas lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">voted to override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting reproductive rights are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The project is intended to provide quicker access to justice as well as a deterrent to crime in Nakivale, which is home to more than 68,000 refugees and 35,000 Ugandan nationals. Without the new pilot court program, those seeking justice would otherwise have to travel over 30 miles to the nearest courthouse to have their claim heard. According to a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/516d29359.html">statement</a> [UNHCR statement] from Adrian Edwards, UNHCR spokesperson, "Our hope is that the mobile courts will speed the rate at which cases are heard, and serve to deter crime by bringing lawyers and a magistrate directly to both refugees and Ugandans in the settlement." This is the first such court to be created in Uganda, but similar courts have been established in refugee camps in Kenya which UNHCR believes has helped reduce criminal activity in the areas.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda">Uganda</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn international criticism lately regarding its human rights record. Last October Ugandan officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uganda-official-denies-support-of-congo-rebels.php">denied UN allegations</a> [JURIST report] that Uganda had assisted rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last June Uganda's government <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-government-banning-organizations-for-promoting-gay-rights.php">banned 38 NGOs accused of promoting gay rights</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-violence-against-children-continues-un.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3462901.stm">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lord%27s+resistance+army">news archive</a>] still poses a threat to children in Uganda. Last March Uganda opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=besigye">Kizza Besigye</a> [JURIST news archive] Besigye's last prosecution gained international attention. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/jurist-1.php">arrested in 2011</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the "Walk to Work" protests. Earlier that year, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-uganda-government-for-protest-response.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Uganda's government to stop using what she called excessive force against Besigye and other protesters.

HRW was permitted earlier this week to speak to al-Senussi, who had been a powerful figure and key ally to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] during his rule of Libya. According to al-Senussi he has not been subject to physical torture or abuse and he has found the conditions of his detention to be "reasonable." According to Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at HRW:<blockquote>Libya's wish to put the people they hold responsible for gross human rights violations on trial is fully understandable. ... But to achieve true justice, they need to give al-Sanussi the rights that the previous government denied Libyans for so long. To start, that means making sure he can consult a lawyer.</blockquote>Justice Minister Salah Marghani, who is overseeing al-Senussi's detention, claims al-Senussi is permitted a lawyer to defend him but that no lawyers have offered to represent him.

<p>This news is the latest in the ongoing effort by Libya to try al-Senussi and Gaddafi's son, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile] rather than turn them over to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. In February the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Libyan officials to hand over al-Senussi to the ICC so that he could meet with a lawyer. In January the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-asks-libya-to-explain-plans-to-try-gaddafi-son.php">asked Libya to address reports</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to try Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi. Last October Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to allow the men to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. Last August Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly. Last June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained by Libyan security forces</a> [JURIST report] and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released. The ICC <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/06/20116278148166670.html">issued arrest warrants</a> [Al Jazeera report] for both men in June 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8422327/Gay-marriage-views-too-rude-to-hear">debate surrounding the controversial legislation</a> [Stuff report] was heated, but the bill was eventually passed on its third reading. Specifically, the bill amends previous legislation to prevent discrimination against same-sex couples. In the preamble to the text, parliament proclaims:<blockquote>We acknowledge that whether or not the ability to marry constitutes a human right has been a topic of much debate. Proponents of the bill have expressed the view that the right to marry freely is a human right, which is currently denied to same-sex couples and transgender people. Opponents of the bill argue marriage is not a human right. The majority of us consider that marriage is a human right, and that it is unacceptable for the state to deny this right to same-sex couples.</blockquote>To this end, the new law will allow same-sex marriage explicitly and make it illegal to refuse to recognize a lawful marriage. The amendment also addresses other aspects of the law, such as adoption. Language included in several different parts of the code has now been changed from "husband and wife" to "spouse" in order to accommodate the change to the marriage definition.  

<p>This amendment makes New Zealand the thirteenth country to legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The issue continues to be controversial both in the US and internationally. Earlier this week, Ireland announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-to-hold-same-sex-Marriage-referendum.php">hold a referendum</a> [JURIST report] on same-sex marriage. Last week, the French senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/french-senate-backs-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt. The day before, Uruguay's legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-congress-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill that is expected to be signed by the president. Last month the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the second of two cases the court heard that week on same-sex marriage. In that argument, the court considered the validity of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law that recognizes only opposite-sex marriages for federal benefits purposes, despite state law on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Also on Wednesday, a Cairo Court of Appeals announced that Mubarak's retrial for complicity in the killing of protesters would <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/04/2013417135216638310.html">begin on May 11</a> [Al Jazeera report].

Mubarak was ordered to be released in the hearing on Monday, as he served the maximum two years in temporary detention, but was kept in custody on charges of fraud. The release of Mubarak was ordered after the judge set to preside over Mubarak's retrial <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">recused himself</a> [JURIST report] days earlier, further delaying the justice process and aggravating citizens who are already suspicious of the justice system.

<p>Mubarak and members of his former government have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the start of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff. In January an Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> [JURIST report] and life sentence and ordered a retrial for the former president on the charge of failure to prevent the killing of more than 800 protesters in 2012. Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million.

Royal Dutch Petroleum</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in-corporate-liability-case-from-last-term.php">report</a>] that nothing in the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] rebuts the US presumption against extraterritoriality and that suits challenging torture and international law violations that took place overseas cannot be brought in US Court. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion. <span class = "casename">Kiobel</span> was held over from <A href = "/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rehear-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-human-rights-violations.php">last term</a> when the court decided, after <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports], that the parties should brief on the circumstance when the ATS should apply extraterritorially. On Wednesday the court held that extraterritorial disputes&#8212;disputes concerning foreign actors that violate treaties to which the US is a party&#8212;cannot be litigated in the US under the ATS, and "sufficient force" is necessary to displace that presumption. The opinion also suggested that "mere corporate presence" will not suffice to bring suit in the US:<blockquote>[N]othing in the text of the statute suggests that Congress intended causes of action recognized under it to have extraterritorial reach. The ATS covers actions by aliens for violations of the law of nations, but that does not imply extraterritorial reach&#8212;such violations affecting aliens can occur either within or outside the United States. Nor does the fact that the text reaches "any civil action" suggest application to torts committed abroad; it is well established that generic terms like "any" or "every" do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.</blockquote>The case was brought by a group of <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Kiobel">Nigerian refugees</a> [JURIST news archives] against <A href = "http://www.shell.us/">Shell</a> [corporate website] and other oil companies. The refugees allege that the respondent oil companies enlisted and aided the Nigerian government in torturing and victimizing Nigerian citizens. This alleged treatment was in response to protests by Nigerian citizens on the environmental effects of the companies' practices in Nigeria.

<p>The decision produced several concurring opinions. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote to state the majority left open many questions on the ATS and noted other provisions for international torture victims in the US Code. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, advocated for a broader reading of the ATS that would have answered some of the open questions referenced by Kennedy. Although the court was unanimous, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan concurred only in the judgment. Breyer wrote that he did not believe the case should be decided under the presumption against extraterritoriality and laid out a three-point guide for when the ATS would apply. "I would find jurisdiction under this statute where (1) the alleged tort occurs on American soil, (2) the defendant is an American national, or (3) the defendant's conduct substantially and adversely affects an important American national interest, and that includes a distinct interest in preventing the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of mankind."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Human Heartbeat Protection Act is an Arkansas law banning most abortions at the twelfth week of pregnancy, if a heartbeat is detected. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy websites] filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Arkansas doctors who provide abortions in the state. The complaint states that the new Arkansas law is "a violation of over 40 years of settled United States Supreme Court precedent" and argues that the new Arkansas law contradicts the holding of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZO.html">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion]. The Human Heartbeat Protection Act is set to take effect on July 18. 

<p>Much activity has occurred involving the abortion states laws in Arkansas in the preceding few months. In March, the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's veto of the Human Heartbeat Protection Act.

The attacks by <a href="http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/al_shabaab.html">al Shabaab</a> [NCTC backgrounder] rebels killed more than 30 people, including judges, lawyers and court personnel. UN expert Shamsul Bari said, "In order to ensure the rule of law and the fight against impunity, the judicial personnel have to be protected and allowed to do their job in a war-torn country like Somalia." Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] characterized the attacks as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/16/somalia-new-al-shabaab-attacks-are-war-crimes">war crimes</a> [press release], saying that, "The current focus on judicial reform in Somalia is critical."

<p>Somalia has recently come under criticism for human rights violations. HRW reported last month that displaced people in Somalia face the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/displaced-people-in-somalia-face-abuse-and-rape-hrw.php">risk of physical abuse</a> [JURIST report] and rape. HRW noted that the threat of beatings and rape from internal security forces was significant and called for the practices to end. According to HRW, "Instead of finding a safe haven from fighting and famine, many displaced Somalis who came to Mogadishu have found hostility and abuse." Earlier in March, a Somali appeals court judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/somalia-appeal-court-acquits-alleged-rape-victim-reduces-journalists-sentence.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against a woman who alleged she had been raped by Somali government security forces and was consequently charged with defamation against the government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

McNeely</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text; Cornell LII <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">backgrounder</a>] may require a warrant for a blood test in a drunk-driving investigation. The divided court ultimately held that "in drunk-driving investigations, the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify a blood test without a warrant." Delivering the opinion in Parts I, II-A, II-B, and IV, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that, while a warrantless search of a person is reasonable if it falls within a recognized exception of the law, the state's argument that the existence of probable cause constitutes a <em>per se</em> exigent circumstance must be rejected. Sotomayor reasoned that when officers performing a drunk-driving investigation "can reasonably obtain a warrant before having a blood sample drawn without significantly undermining the efficacy of the search, the Fourth Amendment mandates that they do so." She further reasoned that Missouri did not argue the existence of any exigent circumstances with regard to the drunk-driving investigation at issue; rather, because the State sought the imposition of a broad, <em>per se</em> rule, the record did not provide the court "with an adequate framework for a detailed discussion of the relevant factors that can be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of acting without a warrant." Sotomayor also delivered the court's opinion with respect to Part III, where she and Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan rejected Missouri's argument for a case-by-case approach to determining whether exigent circumstances exist. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed an opinion concurring in part, while Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. Justice Clarence Thomas filed the court's only full dissent.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-warrantless-blood-alcohol-tests.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January. The dispute arose out of the arrest of Tyler McNeely in the rural Missouri county of <a href="http://www.capecounty.us/">Cape Girardea</a> [official website] in October 2010. McNeely was pulled over by a state policeman after the officer observed McNeely's car cross the yellow center line of the roadway three times. After noticing that McNeely's eyes were red and glassy and that his breath smelled of alcohol, the officer administered several field sobriety tests. McNeely performed poorly on four of the tests and refused to submit to a portable breathalyzer test. The officer then arrested McNeely for driving while intoxicated and brought him to the hospital for a blood sample. Although the state policeman read McNeely the <a href="http://www.drunkdrivingdefense.com/missouri-implied-consent-law.html">Missouri Implied Consent statement</a> [official backgrounder], McNeely still refused. The officer then ordered the sample to be taken anyway, which revealed McNeely's blood alcohol content to be 0.154, nearly double the legal limit of 0.08. After Missouri charged McNeely with driving while intoxicated, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence of the warrantless blood sample. On appeal, the <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=261">Missouri Court of Appeals</a> ruled that the trial court erred, and transferred the case to the <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=27">Missouri Supreme Court</a> [official websites]. There, in January 2012, the trial court's opinion was <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/desktop/public/document/State_v_McNeely_358_SW3d_65_Mo_2012_Court_Opinion">affirmed</a> [opinion]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge panel <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_23045746/court-considers-california-ban-gay-conversion-therapy">heard arguments</a> [<em>San Jose Mercury News</em> report] on whether the First Amendment right to free speech extends to the controversial psychotherapy practice, or whether the legislature had the authority to pass such a ban as a means of regulating the state's licensed mental health professionals. Two federal judges have split on the issue, with one <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-california-law-banning-sexual-orientation-change-therapy.php">blocking</a> the law's enforcement and another <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-california-sexual-orientation-change-therapy-ban.php">refusing to issue an injunction</a> [JURIST reports]. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-appeals-court-blocks-california-sexual-orientation-therapy-law.php">temporarily blocked the law</a> [JURIST report] in December.

<p>California became the first state to enact a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">law banning conversion therapy</a> [JURIST report] in October. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> at the end of August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST reports] last May. Supporters of the bill assert that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and that therapies to reverse homosexuality have been found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> (NARTH) [advocacy website] have voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts on which the bill relies are generalizations and loose assertions. Those who oppose the ban also insist that such measures prevent teens from choosing to obtain professional help if they choose. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy have highlighted a need for <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-246-41y0.pdf">Salinas v. Texas</a> [transcript, PDF] the court considered the boundaries of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] right to remain silent prior to arrest. Genovevo Salinas was suspected of being involved in a murder. He consented to a search of his home, where police found a shotgun, and consented to questioning at the police station, but he was not arrested or given <a href = "http://www.mirandawarning.org/whatareyourmirandarights.html">Miranda warnings</a> [backgrounder]. An officer asked, "if the shotgun [his father had given them] would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder." Salinas looked down and refused to answer the question. The state then offered the refusal to answer as a key piece of evidence against Salinas, which he contends was a violation of his right against self-incrimination. The attorney for Salinas argued that using Salinas' silence in this way violates <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Griffith+v.+Kentucky&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=10858659869332197708&scilh=0">Griffith v. Kentucky</a> [opinion]:<blockquote>The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a person's silence during a noncustodial police interview against him at trial, and nothing about the specific facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from applying that rule here. To the contrary, the State's closing argument in this case urging the jury to find Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, "an innocent person would have denied law enforcement's accusations," strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule, and indeed the Fifth Amendment, is designed to prohibit. It evokes an inquisitorial system of justice. It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by conscripting the defendant as a product of his own demise.</blockquote>An assistant district attorney in Houston argued on behalf of Texas. He suggested that "absent invocation" of the right to silence, refusing to answer a question can be used as evidence against a defendant's innocence. The federal government supported this view, suggesting that <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Minnesota+v.+Murphy&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=2775994573652860905&scilh=0">Minnesota v. Murphy</a> [opinion] holds as "the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in order to claim its protection to a noncustodial interview in." Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed skeptical of this argument: "That is such a radical position, that silence is an admission of guilty. That's really what the argument is. I certainly understand that speaking can implicate you, and if you choose to speak, clearly whatever you say can be used against you unless you're in custody and unless you've invoke the right before. But this is radically different. ... [Y]ou're trying to say acts of commission and omission are the same, but statements are different than silence, because then you're making the person who is asking the question your&#8212;your admission. You are saying you're adopting their statement as true."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-418-ev39.pdf">United States v. Kebodeaux</a> [transcript, PDF] on whether the federal government can compel a convicted sex offender to register with the <a href = "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4905/text">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [text] if they have completed their sentence before <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=SORNA">SORNA</a> [JURIST news archive] was enacted. The deputy Solicitor General argued that "Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies for past violations of Federal law. The Ex Post Facto Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but no <em>per se</em> rule bars Congress from applying sex offender registration requirements, which this Court has held to be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause to past Federal criminal convictions." An attorney on behalf of Anthony James Kebodeaux argued that the situation should be analyzed under the five factors in <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">United States v. Comstock</a> [JURIST report]. She also argued that under "necessary and proper" analysis, the government's requirement of registration here is beyond the scope of that power. "I don't see any problem with them giving notice. That does not impose a Federal obligation on an individual. So there is no power being exerted on the individual."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/16/world/meast/iraq-executions/?hpt=hp_t3">convicted</a> [CNN report] under Article 4,of Iraq's anti-terrorism law, which includes the use of improvised explosive devices, assassinations of doctors and kidnapping women, and sentenced to death. Iraq has been widely criticized for the use of the death penalty, but has continued the practice. Iraq executed 129 prisoners in 2012 and has executed 50 so far this year. According to a recent <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/sites/impact.amnesty.org/files/PUBLIC/2012DeathPenaltyAI.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/death-penalty-use-declines-worldwide-ai.php">report</a>], Iraq continues to be one of the countries that uses the death penalty most frequently. 

<p>Iraq has sparked international controversy over its use of executions and other human rights concerns. Last week Iraq announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/iraq-cabinet-announces-reforms-to-de-baathification-law.php">reform</a> [JURIST report] its de-Baathification laws to allow former members of Saddam Hussein's regime to serve in the public sector. De-Baathificaiton is a controversial subject that should be <a href="/forum/2013/03/haider-hamoudi-debaathification.php">approached with caution</a> [JURIST op-ed], according to a recent JURIST op-ed by Professor Haider Ala Hamoudi.

Last November the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-strikes-down-hungary-law-lowering-retirement-age-for-judges.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Hungarian law that lowered the age of retirement for judges and prosecutors. In recent months, Hungary has taken steps towards changing its policy on forced retirement but has yet to reinstate those who have been forced out of their jobs. Reding urged Hungary to take immediate action to comply with the ECJ ruling and reinstate anyone who was forced into retirement. 

<p>Hungary has been <a href="/forum/2013/04/gabor-halmai-hungary-churches.php">criticized recently</a> [JURIST op-ed] for changes to its constitution.

Ban urged member states to precipitate the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">Rwanda genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The Secretary-General commended Rwanda for its progress towards a peaceful and just society and reiterated the UN's commitment to helping the international community prevent any future atrocities. Focusing on the growing hostilities in Syria, however, Ban urged member states to be more active in prosecuting perpetrators of genocide and war crimes:<blockquote>Human protection, human security, human dignity&#8212;these are shared responsibilities. Collectively, as a human family, we must go beyond words and effectively safeguard people at risk. States must uphold their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law, to prevent abuses and protect their populations from genocide and other crimes.</blockquote>Ban cited the international criminal system as a testament to the UN's commitment to confront the most heinous atrocities and urged member states to continue to seek justice for the victims of the Rwanda genocide. 

<p>After the Rwandan genocide that took the lives of 800,000 people, international and domestic courts have attempted to try those responsible. Earlier this month, French law enforcement officials <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-france-1.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan leader Tite Barahira for conspiracy to commit genocide. To date, it is unclear whether Barahira will be extradited or if he will stand trial in France. Last month, a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/dutch-court-convicts-woman-for-inciting-genocide-in-rwanda.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yvonne Basebya of inciting genocide after finding that she led meetings of a radical Hutu party and sang a song that called for the murder of all Tutsis. Basebya was sentenced to six years in prison. In February, a court in Norway <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/norway-court-convicts-rwandan-genocide-defendant.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] a Rwandan man living in Oslo for acting as an accomplice to the genocide.

With the arrest warrant, Judge Shaukat Siddiqui also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/pakistan-former-president-musharraf-court-arrest">canceled</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">bail</a> [JURIST report] that was granted to Musharraf last Friday. Despite the arrest order, Musharraf escaped the court premises to his home in the suburbs of Islamabad. Musharraf's supporters argued that he was not safe in jail in light of his opponents who may try to attack him. His counsel also claimed that the court's denial of bail constitutes bias and discrimination against their client. On the other hand, opponents and critics such as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned Musharraf's actions for avoiding responsibility for his crimes. In addition to the current charges, Musharraf has also been named as a suspect in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassination</a> [JURIST report] of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>] in 2007. He is also wanted in connection with the murder of a Baluch tribal leader Nawab Akbar Bugti in 2007.

<p>Last week the Pakistan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-supreme-court-delays-musharraf-treason-hearing.php">delayed Musharraf's treason hearing</a> [JURIST report] until this week to give his lawyers enough time to prepare a response to the allegations. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011 Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for the former president but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve the warrant</a> [JURIST report] because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since the <a href="http://worldwideconflicts.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/profile-seleka-coalition/">Seleka coalition forces</a> [WorldWideConflict profile] launched their offensive in December, there have been numerous reports of human rights violations, including targeted killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture, rape, disappearances, kidnappings and recruitment of children. Noting that the conflict has already caused 37,000 people to flee the country and has left tens of thousands more displaced, Pillay called on all parties to implement the <a href="http://publicinternationallawandpolicygroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comprehensive-Peace-Accord-Signed-in-Libreville-2008.pdf">Libreville Peace Agreements</a> [text, PDF] signed in 2008. 

<p>Last month, Seleka leader Michel Djotodia declared in a radio address that the country's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/central-african-republic-rebels-dissolve-constitution.php">constitution is dissolved</a> [JURIST report] and that he is now the nation's leader.

The <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website] also condemned the coup and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-centralafrica-rebels-african-idUSBRE92O0DI20130325">suspended</a> [Reuters report] the CAR from the Union and imposed sanctions against the country. The CAR has also recently been criticized for its controversial use of child soldiers. In January <a href="http://www.unicef.org/index.php">UNICEF</a> [official website] said that it had received "credible reports" of both pro-government and rebel armed groups in the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">recruiting and including children</a> [JURIST report] in its conflict.

Wade, 44, simultaneously served as Senegal's minister for infrastructure, international co-operation, energy and air transportation from 2000-2012. Wade's total budget was equivalent to one-third of the country's expenditure. He was arrested on Monday after his lawyers turned over documents relating to his assets. Wade is being held without bail until trial.

<p>Wade is among a number of former senior government officials currently being investigated for "illegal enrichment."

CCR had filed a <a href=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr-et-al-v-usa-and-lind-chief-judge">lawsuit</a> [CCR backgrounder] seeking extraordinary relief by opening "public and press access to the government's motion papers, the court's own orders, and transcripts of proceedings" from the court-martial of Manning related to his leaking confidential documents to the <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wikileaks">news archive</a>] website in 2010. In a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/press-and-public-denied-access-documents-bradley-manning-case">statement</a> [text] following the rejection of their claim, CCR spokesperson Shayana Kadidal said the decision, "flies in the face of decades of First Amendment rulings in the federal courts that hold that openness affects outcome&#8212;that the accuracy of court proceedings depends on their being open."

<p>Since his arrest in 2010, Manning's case has been controversial. In April the judge hearing the case <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] so that the state must prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. In February Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against him for providing classified materials to WikiLeaks. Also in February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a defense motion arguing that Manning should be released based on a lack of a speedy trial. In January the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/wikileaks-judge-prosecutors-must-prove-defendant-knew-he-was-aiding-enemy.php">ruled</a> that prosecutors must prove that Manning knew he was aiding the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports]. In November the judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a partial guilty plea to several of the minor charges against Manning. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June the judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly withheld from the defense during discovery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN experts want to ensure that the World Bank will respect human rights in all their practices, including but not limited to investment lending. The group of independent experts includes the Special Rapporteurs on extreme poverty and human rights, the rights of indigenous peoples, the right to food, and the Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights. The experts called on the World Bank to expand the scope of areas under the organization's human rights policies, as the organization concluded the first week of reviewing its social policies. 

<p>The UN human rights office continues to push for improvements around the globe. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-abuses-in-central-african-republic.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports of human rights violations in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13150040">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Central+African+Republic">news archive</a>]. Since the Seleka coalition forces launched their offensive in December, there have been numerous reports of human rights violations, including targeted killings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture, rape, disappearances, kidnappings and recruitment of children. Last October, the World Bank <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/world-bank-appoints-former-icc-prosecutor-to-investigate-padma-bridge-corruption.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that former International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ocampo">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [JURIST news archive] will audit an investigation conducted by the Anti-Corruption Commission of Bangladesh (ACC) into whether there are corrupt officials involved in the Padma Multipurpose Bridge project. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Wickham Corwin of the <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/counties/cass.htm">Cass County District Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.inforum.com/event/article/id/396857/">announced</a> [Inforum report] that the law creates an "insurmountable barrier" to abortion and fails to adequately protect women's reproductive rights. The abortion law, which Corwin first <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-dakota-court-temporarily-blocks-medical-abortion-law.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST report] in 2011, would prevent women from taking the abortion drug Mifeprex after seven weeks and would require women to take a second abortion drug at a clinic rather than taking it at home. The law would also increase the price of abortion drugs by 40 percent. North Dakota <a href="http://www.ag.state.nd.us/About/Wayne.htm">Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem</a> [official profile] plans to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> [official website].

Last month Dalrymple signed three laws, <a href="http://legiscan.com/ND/bill/1305/2013">HB 1305</a>, <a href="http://legiscan.com/ND/bill/1456/2013">HB 1456</a> and <a href="http://legiscan.com/ND/text/2305/id/706035">SB 2305</a> [materials], which <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-restrictive-abortion-laws.php">impose the nation's most severe restrictions on abortion</a> [JURIST report].

He <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/19/world/asia/pakistan-politics/index.html">appeared before a magistrate</a> [CNN report] after he was arrested in his home in the suburbs of Islamabad. Musharraf escaped the court premises on Thursday after an <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-musharraf.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] was issued against him on charges of detaining judges during his time in office. Musharraf will be held in custody for two days in his home and then be presented before an anti-terrorism court. His counsel stated that he will continue to appeal the decision canceling his their bail, while Musharraf called the actions against him politically motivated.

<p>Along with the arrest warrant, Judge Shaukat Siddiquialso canceled the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">bail</a> [JURIST report] that was granted to Musharraf last Friday.

Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011 Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for the former president but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve the warrant</a> [JURIST report] because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nine other defendants are also facing charges in the case. Limaj <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130418/kosovo-ex-rebel-now-mp-goes-retrial-war-crimes">pleaded not guilty</a> [AFP report] to war crimes charges stemming from his activities in the village of Klecka during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 war in Kosovo</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kosovo+War">news archive</a>]. Limaj allegedly ordered the torture and killings of Serbian detainees in 1999. He was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-kosovo-authorities-arrest-former-commander-for-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by EULEX in November. The previous trial of Limaj and his codefendants was derailed when a judge refused to allow key witness testimony. A retrial was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/retrial-ordered-for-kosovo-politician-accused-of-war-crimes.php">ordered in November</a> [JURIST report] by the Kosovo Supreme Court. The other nine individuals, also members of the KLA, pleaded not guilty. 

<p>Limaj was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/kosovo-politician-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">tried</a> in 2011 and was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/kosovo-politican-acquitted-on-war-crimes-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST reports] in May 2012. Much of the prosecution's case relied upon the testimony of a former member of the KLA, who was found hanged in September in an apparent suicide before testifying. The Kosovo Supreme Court held that the testimony would be admissible on the trial. EULEX has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008. Limaj was excluded from a cabinet position following international pressure not to include corrupt officials but was elected into the Kosovo parliament. Limaj is an ex-member of the KLA and is viewed as a liberator by many ethnic Albanians. In 2005, Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. An EU judge in September 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-judge-places-senior-kosovo-politician-under-house-arrest-on-suspicion-of-war-crimes.php">placed Limaj under house arrest</a> after EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-kosovo-authorities-charge-10-for-war-crimes.php">charged 10 former members of the KLA</a> [JURIST reports], including Limaj, with war crimes for their actions during the 1998-1999 Kosovo war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Known as the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), the legislation was <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll117.xml">approved</a> [roll call] by a vote of 288-127, with opposition expected from the Obama administration, civil liberties groups and privacy advocates. According to the statute, the Intelligence Community Inspector General would be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/04/19/house-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-bill/">required to produce an annual review</a> [WP report] of the government's use of shared information and companies would be allowed to withhold information if they choose. However, according to civil liberties organizations critical of the bill, under the new law companies will be permitted to share very sensitive and personal customer information with the government and military agencies. 

<p>The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-two-members-of-the.php">reintroduced</a> [JURIST report] in February by Michigan Republican <a href="http://mikerogers.house.gov/">Mike Rogers</a> and Maryland Democrat <a href="http://dutch.house.gov/">CA "Dutch" Ruppersberger</a> [official websites]. Last April the House <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/us-house-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">approved CISPA</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 248-168. In March Obama administration official Melanie Ann Pustay testified before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/obama-administration-seeks-new-protections-for-cybersecurity-infrastructure-information.php">urge congressional officials to amend</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> [official website] to strengthen government's ability to prevent disclosure of information related to critical infrastructure and cybersecurity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, MTV and VH1, was seeking $1 billion in damages as well as an injunction against YouTube for clips that were posted on the website without authorization.

According to Judge Patricia Flores, all actions taken on Rios Montt's case since she was recused in November 2011 are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/19/us-guatemala-riosmontt-idUSBRE93I11V20130419">invalid</a> [Reuters report]. However, Guatemala attorney general Claudia Paz y Paz  says Flores' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/world/americas/judge-in-guatemala-annuls-genocide-trial.html">ruling is illegal</a> [NYT report]. Her office plans to appeal the decision. The issue of suspension of the trial has been <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/guatemalan-judge-orders-rios-montt-trial-suspended-18993773">handed over to Guatemala's Constitutional Court</a> [AP report], which must issue a ruling within 10 days. Rios Montt came to power through a coup in 1982, and he is accused of overseeing the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2013/04/trial-efra%C3%ADn-r%C3%ADos-montt">murder of 1,771 indigenous Ixil Mayans</a> [Economist report] during his 17-month reign. Flores' decision came after defense lawyers walked out of the courtroom in protest. On April 16, a dozen former officials issued a statement saying the genocide trial was detracting from the country's ongoing peace process. 

<p>Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">lauded</a> [JURIST report] Guatemala for beginning the trial of Rios Montt and former intelligence chief Jose Rodriguez Sanchez, both of whom stand accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. Montt has been ordered to stand trial multiple times for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity, and the trial started on March 19. In January a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Rios Montt to stand trial. Last May Flores <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">issued a second order</a> [JURIST report] demanding Rios Montt stand trial after ruling that a sufficient amount of evidence had been mounted against him, necessitating his testimony before a court of law. Rios Montt was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The controversial bill, which would force Clarin to sell profitable business assets, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/argentina-president-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/">President Christina Fernandez de Kirchner</a> [official profile, in Spanish] in October 2009. Kirchner claimed that Clarin was trying to bring down her government through biased reporting. In its decision, the court said that the law would arbitrarily and unconstitutionally limit Clarin's right to hold multiple cable and broadcast television licenses, impeding the company's freedom of expression without benefiting the broader population. It further stated that the executive branch and Congress had failed to state any reasonable explanation as to how the law's effects would serve anyone's interest. The Argentinian government has indicated that it will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. 

<p>Many believe the law is another step towards <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21567387-government-prepares-grab-television-empire-messenger-shot">building a pro-government broadcasting monopoly</a> [<em>Economist</em> report]. The appeals court decision comes at a significant time, as Kirchner is pushing legislation that would reshape the justice system. Legal scholars say her plans would enhance the state's power, making it difficult for people and companies to obtain legal protection against government overreach. In 2009, Kirchner reportedly blamed her 20 percent approval rating and a mid-term election loss on Clarin, which controls 46 percent of the Argentina cable market, and wanted to pass the media law before losing her Congressional majority in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation prohibits abortions based on the baby's sex, prevents abortion providers from receiving certain tax breaks and proclaims that life begins at fertilization. The provision dealing with tax breaks is designed to prevent the state from subsidizing abortions in any way. Opponents of the bill, such as <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/">Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri</a> [advocacy website], denounced the legislation as an extreme governmental intrusion on women's reproductive rights. In a signing statement, Brownback <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/20/kansas-governor-abortion-bill/2098801/">said</a> [AP report] that the legislation is another step toward building a "culture of life." The legislation is scheduled to take effect in July.

<p>A number of states have passed restrictive abortion bills recently. Last week North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">signed a measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier this month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. Last month the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." Days earlier Arkansas lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">voted to override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF], which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.wlea.org/">Wisconsin Law Enforcement Association</a> (WLEA) [union website], a public sector union, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/union-files-lawsuit-challenging-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November, contending that the Budget Repair Bill's limitations on unions' collective bargaining rights violates unions' association, speech, petition, advocacy and equal protection rights. Wisconsin's DOJ wanted the court to <a href="http://news.investors.com/newsfeed-ap/041913-438474-judge-rejects-stay-in-wis-police-union-lawsuit.aspx">delay the ruling</a> [AP report] until appellate courts ruled on another lawsuit against the Budget Repair Bill. However, Judge John Markson rejected the DOJ's argument, saying that the WLEA's lawsuit and another lawsuit filed by school and local government workers address different parts of the Budget Repair Bill and should be dealt with separately.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill has been the subject of legal and political controversy since its passage. In January the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-controversial-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] as a constitutional exercise of power. A Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-controversial-collective-bargaining-law.php">struck down the law</a> [JURIST report] as it applies to school district and local government workers in September. Wisconsin <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-ag-appeals-ruling-striking-down-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] days later. In July the <a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused to reopen a case challenging the Budget Repair Bill because of a justice's <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">refusal to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court's upholding of Act 10 in June 2011 overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">Dane County Circuit Court's decision</a> [JURIST report] that struck down the law for violations of the open meetings rule. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pakistan's chief commissioner <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/former-pakistani-strongman-musharraf-appears-in-court-for-hearing-amid-heavy-security-presence/2013/04/20/47b859f6-a981-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html">later declared</a> [AP report] Musharraf's estate on the edge of Islamabad a temporary jail, allowing Musharraf to remain under house arrest until his trial. The ruling comes in light of Musharraf's recent actions: Musharraf escaped the court premises on Thursday after an <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-musharraf.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] was issued against him on charges of detaining judges during his time in office. He was found and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-places-musharraf-under-house-arrest.php">arrested</a> on Friday, and put under temporary house arrest after appearing before a magistrate.

<p>Along with the arrest warrant, Judge Shaukat Siddiquialso canceled the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">bail</a> [JURIST report] that was granted to Musharraf last week. Also last week the Pakistan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-supreme-court-delays-musharraf-treason-hearing.php">delayed Musharraf's treason hearing</a> [JURIST report] until this week to give his lawyers enough time to prepare a response to the allegations. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation. In February 2011 Pakistani authorities issued an arrest warrant for the former president but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-court-issues-second-warrant-for-ex-president-musharraf.php">unable to serve the warrant</a> [JURIST report] because he was in London. The warrant was issued weeks after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pakistan-investigators-accuse-musharraf-in-bhutto-assassination.php">investigations revealed</a> [JURIST report] that Musharraf had issued orders to the police officers accused of failing to protect Bhutto to remove security detail for her departure on the day of her assassination.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Patricia Flores, who was recently reinstated to the case after being recused from it since February 2012, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-former-guatemala-leader-accused-of-genocide-halted.php">ruled to suspend Montt's trial</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday, stating that all actions taken in the case since she was asked to step down were null, effectively requiring the trial to start over. Judge Barrios <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-guatemala-rios-montt-20130420,0,7327423.story">declared the ruling illegal</a> [<em>Los Angeles Times</em> report], and called the court to order anyway. However, Montt's defense counsel did not show up in court, causing the trial to be suspended, prompting the crowds of Ixil Maya witnesses and supporters to rally in protest. The judges have asked Guatemala's <a href="http://www.cc.gob.gt/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] to <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/04/20/efrain-rios-montt-trial-up-to-guatemalan-high-court/">determine if the proceedings will continue</a> [<em>Fox News</em> report]. The court has 10 days to rule on the dispute.

<p>Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">lauded</a> [JURIST report] Guatemala for beginning the trial of Rios Montt and former intelligence chief Jose Rodriguez Sanchez, both of whom stand accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. Montt has been ordered to stand trial multiple times for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity, and the trial started on March 19. In January a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Rios Montt to stand trial. Last May Flores <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">issued a second order</a> [JURIST report] demanding Rios Montt stand trial after ruling that a sufficient amount of evidence had been mounted against him, necessitating his testimony before a court of law. Rios Montt was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abu al-Khair is known for his defense of other human rights activists, including a group of a dozen men known for demanding human rights and political reform in Saudi Arabia. Abu al-Khair has been charged with offending the judiciary, trying to distort the reputation of the kingdom, obstructing justice and trying to mislead the course of an investigation. His trial began in September 2011 following criticism of the decision of a judge to jail his client for seven months without trial.  HRW criticized the charges as an affront to the rule of law: <blockquote>The Saudi government&#8217;s prosecution of Abu al-Khair is doing far more to distort the reputation of the kingdom than anything he has said or written. If Saudi authorities are truly concerned with the reputation of their judiciary, they should stop prosecuting lawyers who criticize the legal system&#8217;s failings.</blockquote>  Abu al-Khair stated that he expects he would get a long prison sentence if convicted.

<p>Abu al-Khair's trial comes during a sweeping crackdown on human rights activists in Saudi Arabia. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile]  <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-executions-in-saudi-arabia.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the executions of seven people in Saudi Arabia as a violation of international safeguards on the use of the death penalty. Earlier that month a Saudi Arabian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-human-rights-activitsts-to-10-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two human rights activists to ten years in prison. A Saudi Arabian court in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/saudi-arabia-court-convicts-egypt-rights-lawyer-of-drug-smuggling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed el-Gezawi of smuggling drugs and sentenced him to five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. In December HRW urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor who co-founded the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontusflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Saturday released a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/organization-news-and-highlights/aclu-statement-miranda-rights-boston-bombings-suspect">statement</a> [press release] reacting to statements by federal officials that the recently apprehended Boston bombing suspect will not be read his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/miranda_warning">Miranda rights</a> [LII backgrounder] before being interrogated. A <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] official announced on Friday that the government will be<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/19/miranda-rights-boston-bombing-suspect_n_3120333.html"> invoking the public safety exception</a> [AP report] to not read him his Miranda rights before interrogating him on certain topics. This exception was announced by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13717772316457971707&q=new+york+v.+quarles&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">New York v. Quarles</a> [opinion], but has been applied narrowly to allow police officers to refuse to read suspects their Miranda rights when they believe that there is an ongoing threat to public safety which requires answers to certain questions related to that threat. The ACLU, however, stated that this exception "should be read narrowly" and "is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule." ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero cited the dangers to fair application of the justice system that could result: <blockquote>Additionally, every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. We must not waver from our tried-and-true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.</blockquote>The suspect remains hospitalized in serious condition and is being <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/04/20/boston-bomb-suspect-hospitalized-under-heavy-guard/mDucECDNXBn2QN8KMvbFVL/story.html">guarded heavily</a> [AP report], but investigators have been unable to interrogate him and establish the motive for the bombing.

<p>Although the right of criminal defendants to be read Miranda warnings was established in 1966 in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0384_0436_ZS.html">Miranda v. Arizona</a> [opinion], the practice of reading defendants their rights and the exceptions that apply still create controversy. Earlier this month, JURIST guest columnists Hank Asbill, Brian Murray and Andrew Pinson of <a href="http://www.jonesday.com/">Jones Day</a> [official website] wrote an <a href="/sidebar/2013/04/asbill-murray-pinson-salinas.php">op-ed</a> [JURIST comment] arguing that allowing prosecutors to use refusal to answer pre-arrest, pre-Miranda warning questions as an admission of guilt violates the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am5.html">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. The Supreme Court has also examined two aspects of the rule in recent cases. Last month, the Court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-680.pdf">Howes v. Fields</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-declines-to-expand-miranda-privilege.php">report</a>] refused to expand the Miranda rule to apply to private questioning of prisoners about events occurring outside of prison. Last year, the Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-age-is-a-factor-in-miranda-custody-analysis.php">age is a factor</a> [JURIST report] in determining whether a suspect is considered to be in custody for the purpose of reading Miranda rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.europeanvoice.com/page/3609.aspx?LG=1&&blogitemid=1723">agreement</a> [text], negotiated in Brussels on Friday, states that both countries agree not to block each other's efforts to obtain EU membership and allows for ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo to have their own police force and appellate court. It also provides for an association of Serb majority municipalities in Kosovo that will "have full overview of the areas of economic development, education, health, urban and rural planning." Serbia still has not agreed, however, to recognize Kosovo as an independent country even though Kosovo's parliament approved a <a href="http://www.assembly-kosova.org/common/docs/Dek_Pav_e.pdf">Declaration of Independence</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">report</a>] in 2008. Ban congratulated and commended the leaders of the two nations and stated that he "hopes that the agreement will bring about a brighter future and lasting stability to the region." He also encouraged both sides to continue their cooperation in implementing the terms of the agreement.

<p>Tensions have remained high between the two nations since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, partly due to Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. Last year EU Kosovo officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/eulex-arrests-6-serbia-government-agents-in-kosovo.php">arrested six Serbian officials</a> [JURIST report] in Kosovo, alleging that they were "suspected of exerting undue pressure ... not to recognize Kosovo institutions." In 2010 Serbia's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/serbia-parliament-rejects-kosovo-independence-in-perpetuity.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] stating that it would never recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. This resolution was passed days after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icj-rules-kosovo-independence-declaration-did-not-violate-international-law.php">did not violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. The day after Kosovo signed its declaration in 2008, the US and EU member states <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/us-major-eu-states-recognize.php">all recognized Kosovo</a> [JURIST report] as an independent country. In 2007, however, Serbia's parliament officially <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/serbia-parliament-rejects-un-plan-for.php">rejected Kosovo's plan</a> [JURIST report] for autonomy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mekki's letter of resignation was made public the day after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>] <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=NCAGW&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">announced</a> [AP report] a reshuffling of this cabinet. As part of the reason for his resignation, Mekki cited the public protests against him. Mekki is a pro-reform judge who has come under public criticism for siding with Morsi in the power struggle between the president and judiciary. The judiciary has come under close scrutiny because it is the only branch of government not controlled by Morsi's Islamist party. On Friday, Morsi supporters clashed with opponents in violent protests over calls to reform the judiciary.

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month, the country's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed electoral law to the Supreme Constitutional Court for review, thereby delaying parliamentary elections originally set to begin on April 22.

The interim administration, which took office one month ago, told the Pakistani <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] that trying the former president is beyond its mandate because its sole purposes are to oversee the upcoming vote and maintain the status quo for the incoming government. Charges of treason must be initiated by the state and can be punishable by death. The temporary administration was formed to guide the country until the May 11 general election when a new elected administration will take office. Because of its temporary nature, the current government <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/asia/2013/04/22/Pakistan-government-refuses-to-try-Musharraf-for-treason-.html">cannot put into motion</a> [Al Arabya report] any processes the new administration cannot reverse.

Barrak <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kuwait-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-for-criticizing-regime.php">was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] last week to five years in prison for criticizing Kuwaiti Emir <a href="http://www.da.gov.kw/eng/hhamir/hhamir.php">Shaikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah</a> [official website], which is a crime under Kuwait's constitution. The lawyers for Barrak requested additional time to prepare arguments, and expressed concern for Barrak's life if he was to be incarcerated. Barrak has denied the charges of criticizing the regime, but not his statements during a political rally last October. An arrest warrant was issued for Barrak last week, but he has so far managed to avoid arrest, despite the efforts of police and security forces.

<p>The political controversy surrounding Barrak has led to <a href="http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/04/19/the_politics_of_transgression_in_kuwait">political unrest</a> [FP report] in Kuwait, marked by mass protests. Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in October after a public speech was found to contain remarks detrimental to the "social and political balance of the country." The remarks came during a boycott movement led by Barrak <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/kuwait-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-for-emir-insult/2013/04/15/5de552ce-a5a3-11e2-9e1c-bb0fb0c2edd9_story.html">against a controversial election law</a> [AP report] that the opposition claims is illegal and will establish a rubber stamp parliament.

In 2005 <a href="http://www.ad-international.org/adi_home/">Animal Defenders International</a> (ADI) [advocacy website] submitted to the UK Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qON_lFQE4HY">television advertisement</a> [video] with images of a girl in chains in an animal cage juxtaposed by a chimpanzee in the same position. The advertisement was part of ADI's "My Mate's a Primate" campaign against the keeping and exhibition of primates in zoos and circuses, as well their use in television advertising. The BACC refused to clear the advertisement, because the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/pdfs/ukpga_20030021_en.pdf">Communications Act 2003</a> [text, PDF] prohibited broadcasting advertisements possessing the political nature of ADI's objectives. The BACC's decision was upheld by the UK's high court in 2006 and the House of Lords in 2008, both holding the the Communication Act 2003 was not incompatible with Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights. In EHCR's judgment, the court balanced: <blockquote>[T]he right to impart information and ideas of general interest which the public is entitled to receive, with, on the other hand, the authorities' desire to protect the democratic debate and process from distortion by powerful financial groups with advantageous access to influential media.</blockquote>The court found that because ADI had access to alternative media, such as radio and television discussion programs of a political nature and print advertisements, the ban did not amount to a disproportionate interference with ADI's right to freedom of expression. In response to the ruling, ADI stated that it was <a href="http://www.ad-international.org/animals_in_entertainment/go.php?id=3118&ssi=7">"a profoundly sad day for democracy"</a> [press release] and that it deserved the right to refute companies' advertising campaigns.

<p>In November the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/europe-rights-court-upholds-ban-on-use-of-holocaust-images.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a German injunction preventing the activist group <a href="http://www.peta.org/">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> (PETA) [advocacy website] from using <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/">Holocaust</a> [USHMM backgrounder] images in an animal rights poster campaign. The campaign featured pictures of Holocaust victims alongside images of animals kept in mass stocks. PETA argued that the use of the images was governed by article 10. Under article 10 debates concerning public interest, such as animal rights, are afforded particular protection. The ECHR rejected PETA's argument, upholding the decision of a German court to bar use of the images in the campaign. In 2010 the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-strikes-down-animal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 8-1 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-769">United States v.

The <a href="http://rt.com/news/guantanamo-bay-hunger-strike-399/">hunger strike</a> [RT timeline] began in February with just a few prisoners and has grown over the past weeks to include more than half of the detainees. According to the military, while there are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22246527">no life-threatening conditions</a> [BBC report], guards are force-feeding 16 of the 84 strikers, and five are being treated in the hospital. The current hunger strike constitutes the longest protest affecting the largest number of prisoners at Guantanamo where hunger strikes have been a common form of protests. Last week, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">US Department of Defense</a> [official website] reported that detainees were being <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119772">moved to single-cell living</a> [press release] in order for the government to monitor them, and that they would be medically assessed in response to the hunger strike.

<p>The hunger strike has stoked controversy between human rights lawyers and Guantanamo officials about whether prisoners are being provided with sufficient necessities to avoid health issues. Last week, lawyers for Guantanamo prisoners said that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guantanamo-prisoners-lawyers-notified-of-force-feeding.php">US government has started to notify</a> [JURIST report] them when their clients participating in a hunger strike are being force-fed. Last month, lawyers for one Guantanamo detainee filed an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2013/03/27/15/46/g132p.So.56.pdf">emergency motion</a> [text, PDF; <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-human-rights-attorneys-on.php">JURIST report</a>] with the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] alleging that Guantanamo guards were failing to provide prisoners with sufficient drinking water and clothing. Earlier in March, lawyers for some inmates along with the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to a rear admiral describing invasions of privacy and harsh conditions suffered by detainees, as well as the means of protest they have used, including the hunger strike. The lawyers just learned of these conditions after a military judge ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/guantanamo-judge-gives-defense-lawyers-access-to-secret-detention-area.php"> they were permitted to visit</a> [JURIST report] their clients at the camp for the first time in February, although Guantanamo has long been the subject of various controversies during the <a href="/currentawareness/terrorism.php">Global War on Terror</a> [JURIST backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/Original_PDF/2013/04/22/criminal_complaint_130421_1847__1366653273_0367.pdf">criminal complaint</a> [text, PDF], Tsarnaev was charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction against persons and property within the US resulting in death, and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. Tsarnaev made his initial court appearance Monday from the hospital, where he remains in serious condition. If convicted, Tsarnaev could face the death penalty. Earlier Monday, a White House spokesperson said that Tsarnaev, a US citizen, would not be charged as an enemy combatant.

<p>Controversy arose over the weekend after federal officials said that Tsarnaev would not be read <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/miranda_warning">Miranda rights</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] before being interrogated. A US Department of Justice official announced Friday that the government would be invoking the public safety exception.

Last May Russia's <a href="http://www.anticorruption.bg/ombudsman/eng/readnews.php?id=6081&lang=en&t_style=tex&l_style=default">Human Rights Ombudsmen</a> [backgrounder], <a href="http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/People/Luk/lukin1.html">Vladimir Lukin</a> [official profile] <a href="http://rt.com/politics/citizens-results-election-contest-183/">filed a complaint</a> [RIA Novosti report] claiming that regional courts violated the constitution by dismissing citizen's lawsuits contesting the legality of December 2011 parliamentary polls. The lower courts had interpreted Russia's procedural code as only granting voting rights up until the precise moment of voting, whereafter only candidates and parties could contest results for narrow reasons. The RCC rejected the lower court's interpretation, holding Monday that Russian citizens have a constitutional right to litigate the issue of whether their votes have been adequately registered and tallied during parliamentary elections. The judge reportedly noted that election violations and fraudulent polling results undermine citizens' trust in the government, and subvert foundational tenants of democracy. The decision compels Russia's legislative assembly to promulgate guidelines for citizens seeking to contest election results as tallied by the <a href="http://www.cikrf.ru/eng/">Central Elections Commission</a> [official website].   

<p>Voting fraud has been a serious concern in Russia in the past. In December 2011 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/international-election-fraud-monitor-concerned-about-russia-election-process.php">issued findings</a> [JURIST report] that 2011 elections were "characterized by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation." The report noted that the vote count was assessed was "bad or very bad" in 34 of 115 observed polling stations, voting counts were interrupted and taken out of the view of monitors, there were indications of ballot stuffing in 17 polling stations, vote counting errors were noted in 35 polling stations and in several instances election observers were not shown marked ballots of expelled from the polling station during the counting process. Allegations of voting fraud arose in both the 2007 and 2008 Russia elections as well. In 2008 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/russia-presidential-election-observers.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Russia's presidential elections due to alleged media restrictions and polling irregularities. In 2007 election monitoring groups Transparency International [advocacy website] and Golos stated that Russia's parliamentary elections were <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/russia-parliamentary-elections-were.php">rife with fraud and corruption</a> [JURIST report]. Election observers from PACE and OSCE said the parliamentary elections were <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/fraud-claims-cloud-putin-party-win-in.php">"not held on a level playing field"</a> [JURIST report] due to strong media bias towards Putin and the United Russia party leading up to the election, widespread reports of harassment of opposition parties and a new election code that made it more difficult for smaller political parties go gain the seven percent of the vote necessary to serve on the State Duma. They also called Putin's merging of the state with the United Russia party an abuse of power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-10.pdf">Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International</a> [transcript, PDF] the court considered the only <A href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] case this term, on whether the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-83">US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003</a> [22 USC &#167; 7601 text] requires potential funding recipients to "espouse the government's views." The US government withholds funds under the act if an organization does not explicitly denounce <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=prostitution">prostitution</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Deputy Solicitor General argued that "there is a germaneness component to Congress's&#8212;the constitutionality of Congress's funding decisions in this area. And the more sweeping and the less germane the condition would be, the more it's open to constitutional attack. Now, this condition is very, very germane, because as&#8212;because as Congress found, prostitution and sex trafficking contribute to the spread of the disease." Justice Breyer countered with "[T]he people who work with the prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us that if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do if at the same time you've announced you're against all prostitution. So what they're saying is that the condition imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there is a germaneness requirement&#8212;and nobody says the opposite. ... But if everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive and the exact opposite, then can we say, well, it isn't germane." Respondents, a group of advocacy organizations, argued that although Congress has the right to choose where spending is allocated based on views, it did not do so fairly in this case.<blockquote>Congress can certainly fund a particular program and not fund others. And we have no argument with that. [T]he Spending Clause definitely comes with that ancillary power. And in fact that's what the Congress did here. It said, [w]e want to fund a fight against HIV/AIDS. We don't want to support that disease. And we want to oppose prostitution. We don't want to support that practice. What it cannot do, then, is take its viewpoint and impose its viewpoint on the grantee and make it a condition.</blockquote>Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from this case.

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1221.pdf">Hillman v. Maretta</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on if the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8705">Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954</a> (FEGLIA) [text] preempts a state domestic relations equitable remedy which creates a cause of action against the recipient of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) proceeds after they have been distributed. Jacqueline Hillman was widowed by her husband, Warren Hillman. Warren's ex-wife, Judy Maretta, was designated the beneficiary for his FEGLI proceeds. Hillman sued under  <a href = "http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+20-111.1">Va. Code Ann. &#167; 10-111.1(D)</a> [text], which the Virginia Supreme Court ruled was preempted by FEGLIA. Hillman argued that "Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so that the Federal interest ends once the insurance proceeds are paid out. FEGLIA was established to enable Federal employees to carry out their responsibilities to their families. And Congress knew that some of its employees would get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws to help make sure that these family duties and obligations were carried out, because Congress doesn't want to get into the&#8212;the business of regulating the divorce." Maretta argued that FEGLIA creates an absolute right to direct proceeds that cannot be interfered with. "[W]e are not dealing with the generally applicable body of law; we are dealing with something that is quite openly an attempt to do an end run on preemption. The only thing that triggers section D is being a former spouse and receiving the proceeds. The statute doesn't make any inquiry into intent, into whether there has been a tort or an independent contract. It simply reallocates the proceeds. It substitutes a new beneficiary."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The debate over the bill has sparked a wave of violent protests throughout the country. The bill must still be cleared by that nation's <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/">Constitutional Council</a> before reaching the desk of President <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">Francois Hollande</a> [official websites, in French] who has stated he would sign the measure into law.

<p>This law will make France the fourteenth country to legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The issue continues to be controversial both in the US and internationally. Last week, Ireland announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-to-hold-same-sex-Marriage-referendum.php">hold a referendum</a> [JURIST report] on same-sex marriage. Earlier in the month, Uruguay's legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-congress-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill that is expected to be signed by the president.

The appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-and-state-courts-each-order-stay-of-execution-of-georgia-death-row-inmate.php">halted the execution</a> [JURIST report] in February to allow time to consider whether a federal court can reconsider Hill's case. In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court found that Hill's claim of mental retardation was already presented and that his claim does not address his actual guilt or innocence, meaning that it cannot be further reviewed. Judge Rosemary Barkett dissented:<blockquote>The Supreme Court has said unequivocally that it is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to execute a mentally retarded person. ... Despite the Supreme Court's command "that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution 'places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take the life' of a mentally retarded offender," ... the state of Georgia will execute a mentally retarded man when it carries out the
execution of Warren Lee Hill. There is no question that Georgia will be executing a mentally retarded man because all seven mental health experts who have ever evaluated Hill, both the State&#8217;s and Hill&#8217;s, now unanimously agree that he is
mentally retarded.</blockquote>Hill's lawyer said they are <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Appeals-court-lifts-stay-of-execution-for-Ga-man-4455987.php">exploring their next options</a> [AP report].

<p>Hill was sentenced to death for the 1990 murder of a fellow inmate while serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend in 1986. His execution has been stayed several times. The Eleventh Circuit granted the latest stay in February, hours after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-campaign-finance-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hills' petition for <em>certiorari</em>. Hill's appeal to the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/georgia-supreme-court-rejects-death-row-inmates-appeal.php">denied</a> earlier that month. In July the Supreme Court of Georgia unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-supreme-court-halts-warren-hill-execution.php">granted a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] 90 minutes before Hill was scheduled to be executed, in order to consider the state's new single-dose lethal injection protocol. In a separate order the court also denied Hill's request to hear his appeal of a Butts County Superior Court ruling, which held that Hill had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/georgia-court-declines-to-halt-execution-of-mentally-disabled-death-row-inmate.php">failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt</a> [JURIST report] that he is mentally disabled, and that the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard itself is constitutional. The US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2043469055777796288&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">Atkins v.

A three-judge panel ruled in January that the military tribunal that convicted Al Bahlul of conspiracy in 2007 erred because a Guantanamo prisoner could not be convicted of conspiracy unless his crime took place after 2006. The court explained that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] codified conspiracy as a war crime, but did not apply to crimes committed before the MCA was passed. The The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-the-us-department-of-2.php">asked the DC Circuit to reverse the conviction</a> because the court is bound by its decision last October to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-vacates-hamdan-conviction.php">dismiss the case</a> [JURIST reports] against bin Laden's former driver, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. With Tuesday's decision, the entire DC Circuit can now review both cases. Oral argument is set for September 30.

<p>In September 2011 the <a href="http://www.mc.mil/">US Court of Military Commission Review</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/military-court-upholds-sentence-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled in a 7-0 vote</a> that Al Bahlul had been properly convicted of being a propagandist and should <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-sentences-yemeni.php">spend the rest of his life in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. He previously boycotted much of his trial proceedings. Al Bahlul, a 39-year old Yemeni citizen, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/second-guantanamo-detainee-goes-on.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2008. He is alleged to have been bin Laden's personal assistant and media secretary and was charged in February 2008 with conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and attacks on civilians, and providing material support for terrorism. He is accused of researching the financial impact of the 9/11 attacks and also releasing the "martyr wills" of 9/11 hijackers Muhammed Atta and Ziad al Jarrah as propaganda videos. Al Bahlul was the second detainee to go on trial at Guantanamo since the prison there opened in 2002 and is the only convicted criminal currently held at the facility. JURIST Guest Columnist Shane Kadidal of the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/hotline/2013/03/shane-kadidal-guantanamo-bahlul.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] last month that even if the government's petition for <em>en banc</em> review of had failed, it would nonetheless succeed in maintaining the political status quo of the Obama administration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-appeal-to-deport-radical-islamist-cleric-dismissed.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to deport Qatada last month, fearing he would face torture if returned to Jordan. Qatada is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-govt-loses-court-challenge-to-deport-radical-muslim-preacher-abu-qatada/2013/03/27/73e6c648-96d5-11e2-a976-7eb906f9ed9b_story.html">wanted in Jordan</a> [AP report] on <em>in absentia</em> convictions of organizing and encouraging bomb attacks in 1999 and 2000. Qatada has successfully fought deportation in UK and European courts. Qatada was first detained under British anti-terrorism laws in 2002. <a href="http://www.tmay.co.uk/">Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official site] can still petition the Supreme Court directly.

<p>Palestinian-Jordanian Qatada has fought terrorism charges and extradition in court for more than a decade. In December UK authorities challenged a UK immigration decision that effectively blocked Jordanian extradition requests for Qatada. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/special-immigration-appeals-commission">UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> (SIAC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada that May. In early February 2012 he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uk-court-sets-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] but was arrested again in April to begin deportation proceedings. Qatada was granted political asylum by the UK in 1994. He was arrested in 2001 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989 and later that year went into hiding to avoid being arrested and detained under the then-proposed Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He was arrested again in 2002 and held until March 2005. In February 2009 the ECHR ordered the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">pay 2,500 in damages</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada after determining that his imprisonment violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Despite his previous grant of asylum and fears of torture and persecution, UK Law Lords in February 2009 ruled that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be returned</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan to face terrorism charges. The February decision overruled an April 2008 Court of Appeal decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking his deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The USITC concluded that the concept at issue was too obvious to merit patent protection. Although Apple is based in the US, it outsources production of its mobile units to factories in China and Brazil, making it vulnerable to a challenge in the USITC.

The USITC ruled that three of these complaints were illegitimate, and Motorola willingly dropped the other two.

<p>The USITC has been involved in smartphone patent litigation recently. In December Swedish telecom company <a href="www.ericsson.com/us">Ericsson</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/ericsson-seeks-to-ban-import-of-samsung-products.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the USITC against <a href=" https://www.samsung.com">Samsung</a> [corporate website] seeking an import ban on Samsung's Galaxy line of products. Last July the USITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kodak-loses-patent-lawsuit-appeal-against-apple-and-rim.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Apple and Research in Motion did not illegitimately use digital image preview technology patented by <a href="www.kodak.com">Eastman Kodak</a> [official website]. In October the USITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four intellectual property patents held by Apple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">report</a>] that noncitizens have not committed an "aggravated felony" if they are convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana, and are eligible for discretionary review of their immigration case. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that an alien "who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227">deportable</a>" [8 USC &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)]. A state law offense may constitute an "aggravated felony" if it is the equivalent of a "felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act." Under the Controlled Substances Act, a person commits a felony if he possesses with intent to distribute "less than 50 kilograms of marihuana," except that a person whose offense involves "distributing a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration" commits only a misdemeanor. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held for the misdemeanor argument but emphasized the narrowness of the ruling:<blockquote>The Government fears the consequences of our decision, but its concerns are exaggerated. The Government observes that, like Georgia, about half the States criminalize marijuana distribution through statutes that do not require remuneration or any minimum quantity of marijuana. As a result, the Government contends, noncitizens convicted of marijuana distribution offenses in those States will avoid "aggravated felony" determinations, purely because their convictions do not resolve whether their offenses involved federal felony conduct or misdemeanor conduct, even though many (if not most) prosecutions involve either remuneration or larger amounts of marijuana (or both). Escaping aggravated felony treatment does not mean escaping deportation, though. It means only avoiding mandatory removal. Any marijuana distribution offense, even a misdemeanor, will still render a noncitizen deportable as a controlled substances offender. At that point, having been found not to be an aggravated felon, the noncitizen may seek relief from removal such as asylum or cancellation of removal,assuming he satisfies the other eligibility criteria. But those forms of relief are discretionary. The Attorney General may, in his discretion, deny relief if he finds that the noncitizen is actually a member of one "of the world's most dangerous drug cartels," post, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.), just as he may deny relief if he concludes the negative equities outweigh the positive equities of the noncitizen's case for other reasons.</blockquote>Adrian Moncrieffe, a native of Jamaica, pleaded guilty to possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, and the Department of Homeland Security sought to have him removed. Moncrieffe had been in the US legally since he was 3 and was caught at a traffic stop with 1.3 grams of marijuana in his car, "the equivalent of about two or three marijuana cigarettes," as Sotomayor estimated in her opinion.

<p>Justice Samuel Alito authored a dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. "Under the Court's holding today, however, drug traffickers in about half the States are granted a dispensation. In those States, even if an alien is convicted of possessing tons of marijuana with the intent to distribute, the alien is eligible to remain in this country. Large-scale marijuana distribution is a major source of income for some of the world's most dangerous drug cartels, but the Court now holds that an alien convicted of participating in such activity may petition to remain in this country. The Court's decision also means that the consequences of a conviction for illegal possession with intent to distribute will vary radically depending on the State in which the case is prosecuted. Consider, for example, an alien who is arrested near the Georgia-Florida border in possession of a large supply of marijuana. Under the Court's holding, if the alien is prosecuted and convicted in Georgia for possession with intent to distribute, he is eligible for cancellation of removal. But if instead he is caught on the Florida side of the line and is convicted in a Florida court&#8212;where possession with intent to distribute a small amount of marijuana for no remuneration is covered by a separate statutory provision, the alien is likely to be ineligible. Can this be what Congress intended?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-357.pdf">Sekhar v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-right-to-remain-silent-5-other-cases.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on whether an attorney's "recommendation" is intangible property that can be gained through bribery, and thus under the jurisdiction of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875">federal extortion law</a> [18 USC &#167; 875(d)], including the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/131mcrm.htm">Hobbs Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 1951 (a)]. Paul Clement, the attorney representing Giridhar Sekhar, argued that extortion and blackmail can only apply to tangible property:<blockquote>The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act, like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime. Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the scope of the basic criminal prohibition. The Government has offered you a definition of property that only a prosecutor could love: Any intangible right with economic value, but that definition is fundamentally incompatible with this Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State&#8212;New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York crime of coercion.</blockquote>An assistant to the Solicitor General argued that the influence is not the property, but depriving New York's citizens of how its money is spent by exerting influence is the property. In this case, Sekhar allegedly threatened the attorney of New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli to gain a government contract through DiNapoli's attorney's recommendation of Sekhar.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-889.pdf">Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-to-hear-american-indian-adoption-case-2-others.php">report</a>] on to what extent a state can go into another state's territory to utilize a river that flows through both states. The attorney for the Tarrant Regional Water District, out of Texas, argued that the <A href = "http://www.owrb.ok.gov/rrccommission/rrccommission.html">Red River Compact</a> [materials] clearly allowed Texas to use the Red River as it saw fit, and "Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain." An attorney for Rudolf John Herrmann, representing the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, stated that through a strip called Shawnee Creek, all of the Red River in Texas, and Lake Texoma, "Texas users draw water, quite a lot of water," and thus should not need to dip into Oklahoma territory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, however, requested the that government perform security enhancements and further access restrictions to the database by the conclusion of 2014. The court also requested that data protection experts regularly check the database to ensure the program confirms with Germany's data regulations. The database was created in 2007 to assist investigators in tracking down suspects. 

<p>Recently Germany has contemplated the role technology law plays in combating the threat posed by terrorism. In 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-high-court-overturns-data.php">overturned a law</a> [JURIST report] requiring telecommunications providers to store information on telephone calls, e-mails and Internet use for six months for use in possible terrorism investigations. In 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-constitutional-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] legislation prohibiting public support and justification of the Nazi regime.

Musharraf was applying for pre-arrest interim bail, citing severe threats to his safety. Specifically, Pakistani authorities defused a car bomb near Musharraf's house on Tuesday. The court, however, was not swayed by this argument and <a href="http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/04/24/news/national/musharraf-denied-bail-in-bb-murder-trial/">denied</a> [Pakistan Today report] Musharraf's application. Following the ruling, the court transferred the case to the <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk/">Federal Investigation Agency</a> (FIA) [official website] for further investigation with the direction to arrest Musharraf. He has also been connected to the murder of a Baluch tribal leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, in 2007. 

<p>This is the latest development in the controversial cases against Musharraf which span several charges and legal issues. Earlier this week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April, a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] the Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-547y2se.pdf">Metrish v. Lancaster</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether the Michigan Supreme Court violated <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process rights</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] when it recognized a state statute that abolished the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity">diminished capacity defense</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and applied it retroactively to defendant Burt Lancaster's re-trial. The Michigan Solicitor General argued that under <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-rules-on-effective-assistance-of-counsel-standard.php">Harrington v. Richter</a> [JURIST report], "a Federal court may only overturn a State court conviction that is such an erroneous misapplication of this Court's clearly established precedent as to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement. That is, an extreme malfunction." In this case, the SG suggested, the state judge simple exercised fair-minded discretion to apply the statute retroactively. The attorney for Lancaster argued that his client has been treated in a fundamentally unfair manner: that his re-trial was not held quickly enough, that the Michigan Supreme Court abolished diminished capacity based on a statute that does not clearly abolish it, and that the Michigan Supreme Court retroactively applied the abolition to Lancaster. Justice Antonin Scalia questioned if Lancaster had been allowed to bring the defense in a timely fashion, if the Supreme Court wouldn't have just struck it then, and if anyone had ever mitigated their charges in Michigan based on diminished capacity.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-484-83m1.pdf">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</a> [transcript, PDF] on whether the retaliation provision of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [42 USC &#167; 2000e-2(a) text] requires a plaintiff to prove <a href = "http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/But+for+causation">but-for causation</a> [backgrounder] or instead requires only proof that the employer had a <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mixed-motive_instruction">mixed motive</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The attorney for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center argued that <a href = "/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-finds-no-constitutional.php">Gross v. FBL Financial Services</a> [JURIST report] provides that but-for causation is the default and mixed motive is only required when provided by statute. He went further to suggest that since Title VII was amended in 1991 to explicitly provide for a mixed motive causation only in discrimination claims based on a protected class, mixed motive cannot be the standard for retaliation claims, such as the one Nassar is bringing. The attorney for Nassar retorted "It does not make any sense at all for Congress to have created two causation standards under the same statute in 1991 without saying anything about it at all."</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW's <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/115059">report</a> [text] calls the restrictive laws "unprecedented" in Russia's post-Soviet history. Amnesty International's <a href=" http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/eur460112013en.pdf ">report</a> [text, PDF] focused on the multiple new laws and amendments passed in the last year that they claim infringe on individual liberty.

Russia's government has not yet responded to the reports.

<p>Russia has recently faced criticism by other groups over the country's laws restricting personal liberty.

The attorney general's <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/04/25/Israel-airport-security-allowed-to-read-tourists-email-.html">approval</a> [Al Arabiya report] comes in response to an inquiry by the <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/en/">Association for Civil Rights in Israel</a> (ACRI) [advocacy website] which has <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/en/2013/04/24/ag-tourists-israel-emails/">criticized</a> [report] such security measures. Under the law, if entrants refuse to allow their e-mails to be checked, they can be denied admission to the country. The examination of e-mail accounts must be carried out in the presence of the individual. The attorney general justified these checks due to the increasing involvement of foreigners in militant activity. 

<p>In the US, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled in February that Homeland Security's border agents <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-raises-standard-for-border-inspections-of-laptops.php">must demonstrate reasonable suspicion</a> [JURIST report] of wrongdoing before conducting forensic analysis of laptop computers and electronic devices. "Laptop computers, iPads and the like are simultaneously offices and personal diaries. They contain the most intimate details of our lives," wrote Judge M Margaret McKeown. "A person's digital life ought not be hijacked simply by crossing a border." Border searches are an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant preference, but this holding serves to narrow the exception. In 2010 the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the government's ability to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-groups-file-suit-challenging-border-laptop-search-policy.php">search electronic devices without reasonable suspicion</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 Barry Steinhard, Senior Advisor of Privacy International, discussed why <a href="/hotline/2009/09/government-laptop-border-searches.php">reasonable suspicion should be required</a> [JURIST comment] for laptop searches. Also in 2009, John Wesley Hall, Jr., Former President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, discussed why <a href="hotline/2009/08/laptop-searches-at-us-border-implicate.php">reasonable suspicion should be involved</a> [JURIST comment] in border inspections of laptops. Also that year the Department of Homeland Security <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/dhs-announces-increased-oversight-for.php">announced new restrictions on controversial searches of laptops</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">passed its own version of the bill</a> [JURIST report] in January, but must now vote on Senate amendments. A <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/24/us/rhode-island-same-sex-marriage/">vote is expected</a> [CNN report] as early as next week. Governor Lincoln Chafee, who last year signed an executive order <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-order-recognizing-same-sex-marriages.php">granting recognition to same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST report] performed outside of Rhode Island, has announced his support of the legislation. Rhode Island is currently the only state in New England that has not legalized same-sex marriage, and previous attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in the predominantly Catholic state have been unsuccessful.

<p>Same-sex marriage is currently legal in nine states, as well as the District of Columbia. Last month, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments  in two same-sex marriage cases. The first case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [JURIST report], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In the second case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December. Both cases could have an important impact on the ongoing same-sex marriage controversy in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The woman, known as NS, has been fighting for years to be allowed to wear her niqab while testifying and took her case to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website], which ruled in December that trial judge may make a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/canada-top-court-rules-witnesses-may-wear-face-coverings-in-some-cases.php">case-by-case determination</a> [JURIST report]. Justice Norris Weisman weighed NS's religious beliefs with the accused's right to a fair trial and determined that NS must remove her niqab. His lawyer said they will <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2013/04/24/toronto-woman-must-remove-niqab-to-testify-in-sex-assault-case-judge-rules">seek to have the decision overturned</a> [<em>Toronto Sun</em> report] by the Ontario Superior Court.

<p>In January JURIST Guest Columnist Beverley Baines of the Queen's University Faculty of Law argued that the Supreme Court's ruling <a href="/forum/2013/01/bev-baines-canada-niqab.php">weakens the protections</a> [JURIST op-ed] offered to niqab-wearing women. The wearing of traditional religious clothing in court rooms and other public places has been highly contested in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">United States</a> [JURIST report] and around the world. In September the <a href="http://www.parlament.ch/e/Pages/default.aspx">Swiss Parliament</a> [official website, in french] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/switzerland-lawmakers-reject-burqa-ban.php">voted against</a> [JURIST report] a bill which would ban <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqas</a> [JURIST news archive] and other face coverings in public places. Last year the Netherlands announced that a ban on burqas would <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/netherlands-plans-to-ban-muslim-face-veils.php">go forward</a> [JURIST report]. Proponents of the Netherlands ban said the purpose was to stop people from being able to commit crimes and remain undetected by concealing their identities and covering their faces. Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banned</a> [JURIST report] burqas in July 2011. France's ban on burqas <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-burqa-ban-to-take-effect-april-11.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in April 2011. Some commentators have suggested that the rationales behind the European burqa bans are <a href="/forum/2012/02/maurits-berger-burqa-ban.php">weak</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the true purpose of the bills is societal discomfort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This concession marks a significant step toward reaching an antitrust settlement that has been in dispute since the European Commission began investigating Google's near-monopoly in 2010. Google has offered to engage in market testing for one month, during which time Google will accept comments and proposals from interested parties. Google also proposes to, for a period of five years, offer clearer labels to indicate its own products such as Google News and Google Maps, allowing users to better distinguish between natural search results and those promoted by the search engine. Additionally, Google users will be given the option to "opt-out from the use of all their content in Google's specialized search services." Both parties are hopeful that they will reach a final settlement on this antitrust issue by the summer. 

<p>Google formally <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/google-offers-revised-proposal-in-eu-antitrust-investigation.php">offered concessions</a> [JURIST report] to the European Commission for a possible settlement in the antitrust investigation against the company earlier this month. In January the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] held that <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ftc-finds-google-did-not-violate-antitrust-or-anticompetition-laws.php">Google did not violate</a> [JURIST report] antitrust or anticompetition laws. The claims in the case were similar to those currently pending in the EU: Google's practice of favoring its own services in search results, to the detriment of its competitors. Google has faced other numerous allegations regarding its business practices over the past several years internationally. In December an Italian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a conviction against Google executives for privacy violations. In November a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-approves-225-million-fine-for-google-privacy-violations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $22.5 million fine against Google for privacy misrepresentations. In February of last year a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Google's privacy changes by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website]. Earlier that month, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/france-court-rules-google-maps-practicing-unfair-competition.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google Maps was practicing unfair competition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Canada's <a href="https://www.itk.ca/">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami</a> [official website] brought the case alleging concerns that such bans may dry up any existing market for seal products, further hurting the industry. The court held that the ban assists in "harmonizing market conditions within the Union" without adversely affecting "the fundamental economic and social interests of Inuit communities engaged in the hunting of seals as a means to ensure their subsistence." 

<p>The EU Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/eu-court-reinstates-ban-on-import-of-seal-products.php">rejected initial challenges</a> on the ban by Canada's Inuit hunters and fur traders in October 2010. Representatives of Canada's Inuit population <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-inuits-sue-eu-over-seal-trade.php">sued the EU</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010, arguing that the hunting represented a traditional aspect of the Inuit's lifestyle. The Canadian government <a href="http://www.international.gc.ca/media_commerce/comm/news-communiques/2009/327.aspx">took action against the ban</a> [press release] the previous year, initiating the <a href="http://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization</a> [official website] dispute resolution process by requesting consultations. The ban was implemented in September 2009 following extensive public pressure to end seal hunting by groups citing humanitarian considerations. More narrow European restrictions imposed in 1983 caused the industry to suffer a sharp decline. Commercial seal hunting is an economic and cultural staple for the Inuit, who contend that their methods are necessary and humane.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The short title of the bill is The Combating Terrorism Act. The legislation permits law enforcement to hold individuals suspected of terrorist activities for three days without criminal charges and adds 12 months supervision for suspects released without a conviction. The bill also criminalizes leaving Canada to receive terrorism training or aid terrorist groups and strengthens the criminal penalties for terrorist acts created within Canada. The bill was <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&billId=5385776">introduced</a> [legislative history] in February 2012 but was revitalized in the wake of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=boston+bombing">bombings at the Boston Marathon</a> [JURIST news archive]. 

<p>Anti-terrorism laws, and their expanded investigative powers have previously faced judicial review.

The review came after the court announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-high-court-to-hear-terror-suspect-appeal.php">granted an application for leave to appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed by Khawaja in June 2011.

The draft law gives government "security bodies" the power to monitor the finances of domestic NGOs by requiring that any funding be placed into government accounts for a 60 day approval process. In addition, all international NGOs working in Egypt would be required to qualify for government licenses, requiring consent to similar monitoring practices. The CIHRS decried the draft law as a "striking infringement" on the right to freedom of association, and as government suppression of the work of civil society groups:<blockquote>[The draft law] codifies the repressive security practices used by the state against civil society into law. ... [T]hese practices are used to target human rights organizations in particular, as these groups are viewed as adversaries which must be eliminated due their work of exposing systematic violations to human rights. ... [The law] represents an extension of the same philosophy adopted ... in the era of former President Hosni Mubarak which sought to besiege civil society and human rights groups in particular. Indeed, this draft law resorts to even more extreme measures than those seen under the former president.</blockquote>The CIHRS further contends that the law is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/rights-group-says-draft-law-would-give-egypts-government-control-over-non-governmental-groups/2013/04/25/41102efc-add8-11e2-b240-9ef3a72c67cc_story.html">grounded</a> [AP report] in the Islamic regime's "hostility toward the objectives and gains" of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] that toppled former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>]. The CIHRS rejects the law "in its entirety" and urges the government to "reassess its current strategy of circumscribing public freedoms."

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its revolution. This week Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi swore to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-president-affirms-commitment-to-judicial-system.php">preserve the independence of the judicial system</a> [JURIST report] despite protests by Islamist groups to remove thousands of judges. Last month, the country's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed electoral law to the Supreme Constitutional Court for review, thereby delaying parliamentary elections originally set to begin on April 22. In September the Egyptian Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-charges-former-culture-minister.php">brought charges</a> [JURIST report] against former culture minister Farouq Hosni for corruption, who has been accused of illegally obtaining 27 million Egyptian pounds (USD $4.5 million) during his term as culture minister under the ousted president Mubarak.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Obama administration on Thursday <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NLRBvNoelCanningPet.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to uphold the president's ability to make executive appointments while the Senate is in recess. The recess appointment is a constitutional power that permits the president fill vacancies in the executive branch without the typical consent of the Senate. In its petition, the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] presented two questions:<blockquote><ol>
	<li>Whether the President's recess-appointment power may be exercised during a recess that occurs within a session of the Senate, or is instead limited to recess that occur between enumerated session of the Senate.</li>
	<li>Whether the President's recess-appointment power may be exercised to fill vacancies that exist during a recess, or is instead limited to vacancies that first arose during that recess.</li>
</ol></blockquote>The petition warned of serious consequences of the lower court decision: "That decision repudiates understandings of the Recess Appointments Clause that have been maintained and relied on by the Executive for most of the Nation's history." The petition also warned that future essential government activities may be disrupted, and that "almost any federal officer who received a recess appointment during an intra-session recess, or who was appointed to fill a vacancy that did not first arise during the recess in which the appointment was made, could have his actions challenged in the [Court of Appeals] on the ground that his appointment was unconstitutional and his official actions were <em>ultra vires</em>."

<p>The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the recess appointment of three members of the NLRB by President Barack Obama was unconstitutional. The case was brought by a bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Washington state challenging the NLRB after the Board affirmed a decision that the distributor violated the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text]. In addition, two business advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/two-business-groups-challenge-obamas-recess-appointments.php">filed motions</a> contesting the constitutionality of the president's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/doj-defends-obamas-recess-appointments.php">recess appointments</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2012. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] defended the use of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BP\W%3B%20P%20%20%0A">recess appointments</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] by Obama immediately after his announcement. The DOJ's memo argues that although the Senate met between January 3 and 23, the sessions were not sufficient to constitute an interruption of a recess under the Recess Appointment Clause because they were only pro forma sessions that lasted less than a minute and there was no intent to conduct any business. Some experts argue that recess appointments have <a href="/forum/2011/12/victor-williams-recess-appointments.php">regularly been used by presidents</a> [JURIST op-ed] since George Washington. It is only a relatively recent practice that obstructionists have begun holding perfunctory pro forma sessions every three days while the Senate is on recess in order to block recess appointments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to media sources, the 69 year-old former military ruler will be <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pakistan-court-remands-pervez-musharraf-over-benazir-bhutto-killing/articleshow/19736818.cms">held</a> [AFP report] at his Islamabad farmhouse under house-arrest until April 30 to ensure his safety in the wake of numerous and severe threats. Specifically, Pakistani authorities defused a car bomb near Musharraf's house on Tuesday. Earlier this week Musharraf applied for and was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-denies-bail-for-former-president-musharraf.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] pre-arrest interim bail after the threat. The court then transferred the case to the FIA for further investigation with the direction to arrest Musharraf. The ex-president is already <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-orders-musharraf-to-be-held-in-custody.php">under house-arrest</a> [JURIST report] until a May 4 hearing regarding treason charges. Musharraf is required to comply with the orders concurrently. 

<p>This is the latest development in the controversial cases against Musharraf which span several charges and legal issues. Earlier this week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April, a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] the Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Budimir and others were <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-s-police-arrests-federation-president-budimir">detained and questioned</a> [Balkan Insight report] while their offices were being raided and then they were arrested. The group is suspected of receiving bribes in exchange for amnesty, illegal intimidation and drug trafficking. Among the others arrested were Budimir's advisor and the head of the amnesty commission. It is reported that Budimir has accepted 162 of 435 demands for amnesty for those accused or convicted of a broad range of offenses. 

<p>BiH is still recovering from the impact of the Bosnian War which was fought from 1992 to 1995. In the midst of increased corruption, trials of those responsible for atrocities committed during the war continue. Last month, a Bosnian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/bosnia-court-sentences-montenegro-paramilitary-leader-to-45-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Montenegro paramilitary leader to 45 years in prison.

BiH in particular has been continuously prosecuting, convicting and sentencing those responsible for the killings, and even those who left the country are being brought back to face charges. In December the BiH war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bosnia-court-acquits-two-former-policemen-in-srebrenica-massacre-case.php">acquitted two Serbian defendants</a> [JURIST report] of involvement in the massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge to the laws came from members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Westboro+Baptist+Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [JURIST news archive], who routinely protest the funerals of soldiers and claim that US soldiers killed in combat are God's retribution for American tolerance of homosexuality. The court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/court-upholds-missouri-protest-ban-within-300-feet-of-funerals-strikes-broader-restrictions/2013/04/26/ce23efb4-ae90-11e2-b240-9ef3a72c67cc_story.html">concluded</a> [AP report] that <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c500-599/5780000501.htm">section 578.501</a> [text] of the Missouri statutes, which barred protests "n front of or about any location at which a funeral is held" was unconstitutional because the language was too broad and imprecise, and violated the free speech protection of the First Amendment. The court did uphold <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c500-599/5780000502.htm">section 578.502</a> [text], finding that the 300 foot buffer zone created by the law was constitutional, in that it is "narrowly tailored to serve Missouri's interest in protecting the peace and privacy of funeral attendees," while providing "alternative channels" for protesters to communicate their message. Part of the case was remanded to the district court to address other constitutional challenges brought against the law by the Church.

<p>The Westboro Baptist Church has triggered laws in a number of states limiting the ability to protest funerals. Last year the Eighth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/appeals-court-upholds-citys-funeral-protest-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a municipality's ban on funeral protests. The court ruled that a ban on funeral protests in Manchester, Missouri, was a legitimate restriction on the First Amendment, calling it a "legitimate time, place, and manner regulation" and saying it gave protesters ample opportunities to express their views in other venues. In 2011 Arizona Governor Jan Brewer <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-passes-emergency-law-prohibiting-funeral-protests.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/sb1101s.htm&Session_ID=102">emergency legislation</a> [SB110] making it a crime to picket or protest a funeral. The Church's challenges have been based on the March 2011 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-allows-military-funeral-protests.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-751">Snyder v. Phelps</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], where the court found that the First Amendment free speech protections extend to protesters at military funerals.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpennsylvania.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-118-2012mo.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday in a deed dispute over Marcellus shale gas rights that the gas is not considered a "mineral." The dispute dates back to an 1881 deed that conveyed partial mineral rights to the property holder. In the decision, the court reaffirmed Pennsylvania's "Dunham rule," derived from <a href="http://www.gibbonslaw.com/files/1322846677.pdf">Dunham v. Kirkpatrick</a> [text, PDF], which created the rebuttable presumption that oil and gas are not considered minerals. The court found that, notwithstanding different interpretations proffered by other jurisdictions, the rule in Pennsylvania is that natural gas and oil are not minerals because they are not of a metallic nature, as the common person would understand minerals." In addition, the court rejected the appellee's argument that because the gas is derived from Marcellus shale that the gas belongs to the individual that owns the shale itself. Instead of accepting the analogy put forward by the appellee comparing Marcellus shale and the natural gas derived from it to coal and its gases, the court asserted this was not applicable because the gas from Marcellus shale is merely natural gas trapped in the shale not a by-product like that of coal.  

<p>This is the latest decision surrounding the legal controversies created by <a href="/feature/2013/02/fracking.php">shale drilling practices</a> [JURIST feature]. Last month, New York lawmakers approved a two-year fracking moratorium. Also in March, JURIST guest columnist Nicolas Parke <a href="/dateline/2013/03/nicolas-parke-fracking-regulation.php">debunked the rumors</a> [JURIST op-ed] around fracking. In February JURIST guest columnist Samantha Peaslee detailed the <a href="/dateline/2013/02/samantha-peaslee-home-rule-fracking.php">future of fracking</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Colorado in the wake of recent lawsuits against fracking companies in the state. In September Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection and Public Utility Commission filed a brief arguing that a recent Pennsylvania court decision which struck down portions of a law allowing the state to determine where fracking could occur <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-agencies-submit-brief-in-shale-drilling-law-appeal.php">was an error</a> [JURIST report]. In July North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue vetoed a <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/billlookup/billlookup.pl?Session=2011&BillID=S820">bill</a> [SB 820 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-bill-to-allow-fracking.php">report</a>] that would have lifted the state's ban on fracking. Last May Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/vermont-becomes-first-state-to-outlaw-fracking.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill outlawing fracking in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In August Tolokonnikova and two other members of the group were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison for "hooliganism," characterized by the court as driven by religious hatred, in connection to the band's February 2012  "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in at the altar of Moscow's <a href="http://www.xxc.ru/english/">Christ the Savior Cathedral</a> [official website], a space maintained to be sacred to the Russian Orthodox Church. Tolokonnikova has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-russia-pussyriotbre93p15r-20130426,0,4804884.story">served eight months</a> [AP report] of her sentence in a prison colony in central Russia. In rejecting Tolokonnikova's parole request, the judge held that her parental status had already been acknowledged by the legal system when she was sentenced to two years in prison after prosecutors had sought three. In addition, the court cited Tolokonnikova's violations of prison regulations as evidence that she was unfit to leave incarceration.  

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot sparked an international outcry against the Russian political and judicial system. In February members of the band <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/russia-feminist-rock-group-appeals-conviction-to-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] challenging their conviction. They contend that their conviction violates four articles of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. In January a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-feminist-rock-group-appeal-of-internet-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the band's appeal of an Internet ban on their videos. The court ruled that the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government was "extremist" and President Vladimir Putin argued that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population. During the same month a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-sentencing-deferral-for-imprisoned-feminist-rocker.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a sentencing deferral for band member Maria Alekhina, despite her having a young child. In October Alekhina and Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred to separate regional prisons</a> [JURIST report] generally reserved for dangerous criminals to serve their two-year sentences.

The opposition groups originally requested Egypt's upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://www.shoura.gov.eg/(S(p4e0jyzixtgsalfkvwmgaqta))/App_Ara/default.aspx">Shura Council</a> [official website, in Arabic], to discuss the budget and <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/70221/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-opposition-demand-public-debate-on-state-bud.aspx">brought the lawsuit</a> [Ahram report] when they refused. The group is also alleging that having the Shura Council review the budget is unconstitutional because the budget falls within the purview or the House of Representatives, which was dissolved in June. At an <a href="http://ecesr.com/">Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights</a> (ECESR) [official website, in Arabic] press conference, a representative from the Strong Egypt Party argued it is the right of every citizen to have access to the country's budget to increase transparency. 

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Earlier this month, the Shura Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-upper-house-approves-new-election-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the new election procedures to elect the House of Representatives. This process has been delayed, however, by Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referring</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed electoral law to the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) for review last month. The court's decision was said to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-egypt-elections-court-idUSBRE9250S320130306">based on technical grounds</a> [Reuters report], namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral law to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was amended in five key areas, as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">demanded by the high court</a> [JURIST report] in February. Also in March, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Knaul visited Russia as part of an investigation surrounding a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44771&Cr=judicial&Cr1=#.UX0chYleui0">report on judicial independence</a> [UN News Centre report] in Russia to be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2014 in Geneva. Among her concerns were the judicial mindset of judges still under the influence of the Soviet era judicial system, which created close ties between the judges and prosecutors. Also, lawyers often face threats and attacks when they attempt to enforce decisions. This, Knaul argues, causes a "chilling effect" on the legal system. Finally, Russia's NGO 'foreign agents' law is cause for concern. The law limits the "invaluable" role non-government organizations are able to play in the legal aid context. Knaul also noted that Russia has recently made great efforts to improve the working conditions of the justices. The use of more modern technology and upgrades to facilities have aided the administration of justice.

<p>Human rights and similar concerns in Russia have been in the spotlight recently. The imprisonment of members of <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] sparked an international outcry against the Russian political and judicial system. Earlier this month, a member of the feminist rock group was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/member-of-russia-feminist-rock-group-denied-parole.php">denied parole</a> [JURIST report]. Also this month, rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rights-groups-criticize-russia-laws-restricting-free-speech.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Russia's restrictions of free speech rights. On the positive side, days before, a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/russia-court-grants-citizens-right-to-contest-election-results.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] citizens the right to challenge parliamentary election results. Russia's lower house also <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/russia-lower-house-approves-bill-criminalizing-actions-against-religious-groups.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a law criminalizing actions against religious groups. However, last month, Russia enforced its NGO 'foreign agents' law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/russia-enforces-ngo-foreign-agents-law.php">enforced</a> [JURIST report] by Russian authorities for the first time. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mubarak and members of his former government have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the start of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff.

Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment. Last August the former secretary for the Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-mubarak-ends-after-judge-recuses-himself.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] for abusing his office by obtaining real estates at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial, although their lawyer argued they were detained unlawfully for longer than permissible under Egyptian law.

In her <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/138245541-International-Criminal-Court-Annex-2-Decision-on-Defence-Application-Pursuant-to-Article-64-4-and-Related-Requests.pdf">concurring opinion</a> [text, PDF] denying a defense motion to refer the case back to the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber, Van den Wyngaert described the prosecution as "negligent" and claimed: <blockquote>"[T]here are serious questions as to whether the Prosecution conducted a full and thorough investigation of the case against the accused prior to confirmation. In fact, I believe that the facts show that the Prosecution had not complied with its obligations under article 54(1)(a) at the time when it sought confirmation and that it was still not even remotely ready when the proceedings before this Chamber started."</blockquote>Article 54 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] establishes the obligations and duties on ICC prosecutors conducting criminal investigations. Despite the alleged deficiencies in the prosecution's case the trial is set to begin on July 9.

<p>Even with the crimes against humanity charges pending against him, Kenyatta was still able to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">win a controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency last month. Kenyatta was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">sworn in</a> following a March <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] from Kenya's <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/the-supreme-court.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] that the results of the country's presidential election were valid, denying an <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Kenyan <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. Earlier in March Kenyatta's lawyer asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him for lack of evidence, but the prosecution refused. Kenyatta's request was based on the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1568411.pdf">withdrawal</a> [decision, PDF] of charges against co-defendant Francis Muthaura for lack of evidence. Kenyatta's lawyers claimed the evidence against Muthaura and Kenyatta was the same, but the prosecution disagreed. Kenyatta's trial has already been <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php#">postponed</a> [JURIST report] once in March after Kenyatta's defense team argued that they needed more time to respond to evidence revealed to them at the last minute leading up to the trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appellant, Marie Fleming, suffers from end stage multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system, and as a result is paralyzed. Fleming challenged the constitutionality of Ireland's 1993 <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0011/index.html">Criminal Suicide Act</a> [text] which decriminalized suicide but provides that, "A person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years." Fleming <had a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/irish-supreme-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-cannot-legally-commit-suicide-with-partners-help/2013/04/29/ca853cb0-b0c9-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html">argued</a> [AP report] that blocking her access to assisted suicide violated her rights to personal and bodily autonomy and self determination under the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Basic+Texts/The+Convention+and+additional+protocols/The+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights/">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [official website] as integrated into the Irish <a href="https://www.constitution.ie/Documents/Bhunreacht_na_hEireann_web.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The court concluded that there is no explicit right to commit suicide in the constitution. The court noted, however, that the ruling does not prevent the Irish Parliament from passing legislation that would allow assisted suicide for individuals such as Fleming. 

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world.The only European countries that allow euthanasia are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In December a report released by the French government <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/france-report-recommends-permitting-doctors-to-accelerate-death-for-terminally-ill.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that the country permit doctors to "accelerate death" for terminally ill patients seeking doctor-assisted euthanasia. In August the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/uk-high-court-rules-against-paralyzed-man-in-right-to-die-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the plea of a paralyzed man challenging the legitimacy of the Suicide Act 1961 and other laws barring his ability to commit suicide. In 2011 an Indian high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] passive euthanasia was permitted under certain circumstances. In 2010 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that removing a patient from life support would not be a criminal offense if the patient had previously given consent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khadr was born in Toronto and is the son of alleged al Qaeda financier <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/khadr/slides.html">Ahmed Said Khadr</a> [CBC profile]. In 2010 Khadr pleaded guilty to a number of crimes as part of a plea bargain, including the killing a US solider in Afghanistan when he was 15. Khadr's lawyers hope that his conviction can be appealed on the same grounds as <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/05/ali-hamza-ahmad-suliman-al-bahlul">Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman Al Bahlul</a> [HRW profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahlul">news archive</a>], the media secretary for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bin+laden">Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive] whose conspiracy conviction was vacated by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website]. The DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-appeals-court-vacates-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the military tribunal that convicted Al Bahlul of conspiracy in 2007 erred because a Guantanamo prisoner could not be convicted of conspiracy unless his crime took place after 2006. The court explained that the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF] codified conspiracy as a war crime, but did not apply to crimes committed before the MCA was passed.

<p>Last week the DC Court of appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-overturned-conviction-of-al-qaeda-media-director.php">agreed</a> to an <em>en banc</em> review of its January decision vacating Al Bahlul's conspiracy conviction. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/jurist-the-us-department-of-2.php">asked the DC Circuit to reverse the conviction</a> because the court is bound by its decision last October to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-vacates-hamdan-conviction.php">dismiss the case</a> [JURIST reports] against bin Laden's former driver, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. With last week's decision, the entire DC Circuit can now review both cases. Oral argument is set for September 30. Khadr was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainee-khadr-to-canada.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Canada in 2012. In 2010 he claimed that his confession to the charges against him was a byproduct of torture, but those claims were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rejects-khadr-torture-claims.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] by a military judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lufti Dervishi and his son Arban Devishi were found guilty of "Trafficking in Persons and Organised Crime." Sokol Hajdini, Islam Bytyqi and Sulejman Dulla were found guilty of charges of "Grievous Bodily Harm." The sentences ranged from one to eight years, and Bytyqi and Dulla will receive suspended sentences. The group was accused of enticing poor people in the country to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/kosovo-court-jails-3-in-organ-trafficking-case-2-out-on-parole-and-2-cleared-of-charges/2013/04/29/8efd070c-b0da-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html">give kidneys in exchange for payment</a> [AP report].

"[The] report contributes to a better understanding of the underlying economic and social vulnerabilities that generate child labour." Globally, the ILO estimates that at least 215 million children are in an adverse labor situation, with 115 million suffering the worst treatment including "practices akin to slavery, debt bondage, offering a child for prostitution, using a child for illicit activities and work that is harmful to health, safety or morals of children." To combat the problem, the ILO advocates the implementation of "social protection floors" in all countries to provide for the most basic needs of children. Further, the report highlights a number of programs currently showing success. For example, programs in Brazil and Cambodia have seen positive outcomes when linking cash transfers to families who actively support their children in education. In Guatemala, the report referenced a study that indicated that families where even one member of the household is covered by health insurance, there is a notable decrease in the likelihood of participation in the child labor markets.

<p>In recent years, forced labor has been a growing subject of international attention, with particular reference to human trafficking. In February the ILO released a report estimating that 21 million people are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-greater-effort-to-end-forced-labor.php">subject to forced labor</a> [JURIST report], which often includes human trafficking for labor exploitation, and identified solutions to address the issue. Commentators <a href="/forum/2013/04/susan-bitensky-ilo-labor.php">welcomed the report</a> [JURIST op-ed], but criticized its lack of focus on the root cause of poverty. In January, the ILO released a report highlighting the <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-report-shows-domestic-workers-lack-adequate-legal-protections.php">vulnerability of domestic workers</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. In June, the ILO released a report estimating that forced labor workers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/nearly-21-million-work-in-forced-labor-report.php">nearly doubled</a> [JURIST report] worldwide from its 2005 estimate of 12 million. In November 2011, the UN criticized North Korea for allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">abusing political prisoners in forced labor camps</a> [JURIST report]. In August of the same year, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">urged Thailand to combat forced labor</a> [JURIST report], especially with regard to human trafficking. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Young</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-privileges-and-immunities-and-foreign-taxes.php">report</a>] that Virginia has the right to exclude non-residents from accessing state records under its <a href = "http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.2-3700">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. The court determined the law did not violate the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privileges_and_immunities_clause">Privileges and Immunities Clause</a> [text] of Article IV of the US Constitution, as it did not burden any fundamental privilege or immunity. The court also found the information was not part of the interstate market and thus did not implicate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">dormant commerce clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion, stating that the law does not implicate either constitutional provision, as Virginia "provides a service that is related to state citizenship."<blockquote>Petitioners allege that Virginia's citizens-only FOIA provision violates four different "fundamental" privileges or immunities: the opportunity to pursue a common calling, the ability to own and transfer property, access to the Virginia courts, and access to public information. The first three items on that list, however, are not abridged by the Virginia FOIA, and the fourth&#8212;framed broadly&#8212;is not protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence reiterating his long-held view that the dormant commerce clause does not exist. "I join the Court's opinion. Though the Court has properly applied our dormant Commerce Clause precedents, I continue to adhere to my view that '[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.'"

<p>The court also issued a <em>per curiam</em> opinion declining to rule on the already argued <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-9953_4h25.pdf">Boyer v. Louisiana</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-mandatory-sentences-speedy-trial-clause.php">report</a>] by dismissing it as improvidently granted. Alito wrote a concurrence explaining that while the question was to consider if the state's delay in paying a defense attorney could violate the speedy trial requirements of the constitution, the record showed that the defense had caused the trial to move along at a "plodding" pace. "In sum, the record shows that the single largest share of the delay in this case was the direct result of defense requests for continuances, that other defense motions caused substantial additional delay, and that much of the rest of the delay was caused by events beyond anyone's control. It is also quite clear that the delay caused by the defense likely worked in petitioner's favor." Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by three justices, dissented from the dismissal of <em>certiorari</em>. "Rather than dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, I would simply address this question. Our precedents provide a clear answer: Such a delay should weigh against the State. It is important for States to understand that they have an obligation to protect a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after Morales's first term in office began in 2005. In 2008, Morales <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/bolivia-president-offers-concession-to.php">engineered an endorsement</a> [JURIST report] of the constitution by agreeing not to seek reelection in 2014. However, the court said the two consecutive term limit does not apply retroactively, meaning next year's election would legally count as Morales's first re-election. Elections are scheduled for December 2014. If Morales prevails he will become Bolivia's longest-serving president. 

<p>Morales is the first indigenous president to be elected in Bolivia and the <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/bolivia-president-promises-justice-for.php">theme of his presidency</a> [JURIST report] has been advancing the interest of the majority indigenous community.

Bolivia's new constitution went into effect in February 2009, placing more power in the hands of the country's majority. It also created seats in Congress for minority indigenous groups. In August 2008, Morales won a referendum to continue his presidency, which he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">personally proposed</a> in a bid to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">legitimize his campaign</a> [JURIST reports] for the constitutional changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to media sources, the 69-year-old former military ruler will be <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-26/news/38843626_1_gun-and-suicide-attack-bilawal-bhutto-zardari-benazir-bhutto">held</a> [AFP report] at his Islamabad farmhouse under house-arrest until May 14 to ensure his safety in the wake of numerous and severe threats. Specifically, Pakistani authorities defused a car bomb near Musharraf's house on April 30. 

<p>This is the latest development in the controversial cases against Musharraf which span several charges and legal issues. Last week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April, a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year, Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011, a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Advancing Students for a Stronger Economy Tomorrow (ASSET) law requires students to have attended high school in Colorado for at least three years or have earned a general equivalency diploma (GED), and to show proof of intent to become a US citizen. Undocumented immigrant students may be eligible for institutional or financial aid. The bill was first proposed in 2003. Colorado is the fourteenth state to pass such a law, with <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/oregon-governor-signs-tuition-bill-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">Oregon passing a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a hot button issue over the past few years.

Under the legislation, an undocumented immigrant would have the opportunity to be come classified as a "Registered Provisional Immigrant." In March the Georgia General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/georgia-lawmakers-expand-immigration-law.php">implemented stricter security and immigration compliance</a> [JURIST report] in an amendment to Senate Bill 160. The modifications imposed tougher penalties and heightened identification requirements. The bill prevents undocumented immigrants from securing an adult education, driver's license, grants, public housing and other federal, state and local benefits. In the same month Maryland Senate approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-bill-permitting-undocumented-immigrants-to-receive-drivers-licenses.php">allowing driver's licenses</a> [JURIST report] for undocumented immigrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/30/remarks-president-vice-president-first-lady-dr-jill-biden-and-petty-offi">news conference</a> [transcript] Tuesday, Obama was asked about the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/gitmo_chart/">ongoing hunger strike</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> graphic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+hunger+strike">news archive</a>], now involving 100 of the 166 detainees. He responded, "Well, it is not a surprise to me that we've got problems in Guantanamo, which is why when I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008, and when I was elected in 2008, I said we need to close Guantanamo. I continue to believe that we've got to close Guantanamo." Obama went on to say:<blockquote>Now, Congress determined that they would not let us close it&#8212;and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country. I'm going to go back at this. I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively. And I'm going to reengage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interest of the American people. And it's not sustainable. </blockquote>Rights groups, such as the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform-human-rights-national-security-prisoners-rights/aclu-statement-presidents">welcomed</a> [press release] the president's statement. On Wednesday a group of UN human rights experts said the indefinite detention may be a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13279&LangID=E">violation of international law</a> [press release].

<p>Earlier this week JURIST Guest Columnist David Frakt of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law argued that the Obama administration should <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">release those detainees</a> [JURIST op-ed] held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US. Last month  UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for US authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-calls-for-guantanamo-prison-closure.php">close down the Guantanamo prison camp</a> [JURIST report], emphasizing the continued indefinite incarcerations of many detainees as a clear violation of international law. During his 2008 campaign, Obama stated that closing the Guantanamo military prison would be a priority for his first term. Shortly after he assumed office, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] for the closure of the site within one year. According to Frakt, the Obama administration is <a href="/forum/2012/09/david-frakt-guantanamo-detainees.php">not solely to blame</a> [JURIST op-ed] for Guantanamo remaining open. The US Congress has, since 2009, "passed a series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo." Other scholars, including Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz, have <a href="/forum/2011/04/failing-to-close-guantanamo.php">raised concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] about how the failure to close Guantanamo Bay "has helped justify the policies of arbitrary detention and torture that spurred its creation in the first place."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two bills reform the Judicial Council and regulate precautionary measures. One bill alters the council candidacy requirements and reduces the majority number requirements for decisions. Elections are held by direct popular vote, and judges can be removed without the option of appeal. UN expert Gabriela Knaul expressed concern over the "partisan election" provision and called on Argentina to establish clear procedures and criteria for judge dismissals, as well as a remedy to challenge the decision. She said, "Providing the opportunity for political parties to propose and organize the election of the members of the Judicial Council threatens their independence, thereby seriously jeopardizing the principles of separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, which constitute fundamental elements of any democracy and rule of the law." 

<p>Argentina has been prosecuting those accused of committing human rights abuses during the nation's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>]. During the "Dirty War", an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or "disappeared" in a government-sponsored campaign against suspected dissidents. In March Reynaldo Bignone was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-argentina-general-sentenced-to-life-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report], along with four other former soldiers found guilty of crimes committed against 23 victims. In March 2011 an Argentine court commenced the trial of former dictators Jorge Videla and Bignone for allegedly overseeing a systematic plan to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-begins-trial-over-dirty-war-baby-thefts.php">steal babies</a> [JURIST report] born to political prisoners during the "Dirty War." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://home.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] brought the case against the <a href="http://www.atf.gov/">US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] in 2010, claiming that the law violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] rights of their members between the ages of 18 and 21. However, the 41-page opinion agreed with the reasoning of Congress, acknowledging that "persons under 21 tend to be relatively irresponsible and can be prone to violent crime, especially when they have easy access to handguns."

The proposed law would not significantly change the country's strict laws on abortion, but rather would provide doctors with clarity on how to assess whether an abortion is medically necessary. The prime minister clarified that abortion would be legally permitted only if it is "unanimously certified that it is the only treatment that will save the woman's life." The law would also set a maximum 14-year penalty for the performance of an abortion deemed not to be medically necessary. 

<p>Ireland has some of the most conservative abortion laws in Europe, and the subject remains a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/europe/hospital-death-in-ireland-renews-fight-over-abortion.html?_r=0">highly divisive</a> [NYT report] issue. Wednesday's proposed legislation comes shortly after the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion in Ireland. Following her death, Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://www.gilmore.ie/">Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ireland-deputy-pm-promises-to-clarify-abortion-laws-following-death.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring "legal clarity" to Ireland's abortion laws. In November the Irish Department of Health received an <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/taoiseach-expert-group-delivered-abortion-report-last-night-574183.html">expert group report</a> [<em>Irish Examiner</em> report] on how Ireland should deal with its abortion laws. The report was commissioned after a 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website], which stated that Ireland failed to provide "effective and adequate procedures" to allow women to exercise their right to a lawful abortion and that the country's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12008623">legal situation</a> [BBC backgrounder] constituted a "chilling factor" for both women and doctors. The ruling came after a woman suffered complications when she had to travel from the Irish Republic to the UK in 2005 to seek an abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the first time that the court has addressed the problem with air pollution in the UK, which is the worst in the EU, resulting in as many as <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/01/uk-britain-pollution-idUKBRE9400DQ20130501">29,000 early deaths a year</a> [Reuters report].

The UK exceeds the limit in 40 out of 43 of its air quality zones. The court referred legal questions to the ECJ and will await a response before proceeding with recommendations.

In 2005 organizations and individuals concerned with women's health filed suit in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] in pursuit of expanded access to the drugs, including over the counter (OTC) availability regardless of age. The judge ruled in their favor, but in December 2011 the Secretary of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website], <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Kathleen Sebelius</a> [HHS profile], intervened to block the ruling as it related to minors, citing inadequate evidence concerning adverse health effects. In April the district court overruled Sebelius' "unprecedented" action, ruling that her intervention and the FDA's subsequent compliance amounted to an "arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable" response to the order. In addition, the judge found that the prescription requirement for adolescents under age 16 was "unjustified and burdensome." On Tuesday, the FDA announced that the drugs would soon be available without prescriptions in response to the April decision. Just one day later, the DOJ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/health/us-will-appeal-order-on-morning-after-pill.html?_r=0">challenged the court order</a> [NYT report], claiming that the judge overstepped his legal authority.

<p>Plan B has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since the FDA approved nonprescription access to the drug in 2006. In September the Appellate Court of Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/illinois-appeals-court-rules-pharmacists-can-refuse-to-dispense-birth-control-drugs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Illinois cannot force pharmacists to fill prescriptions for emergency contraceptives if they have religious objections to these drugs. In February 2012 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-state-rules-requiring-dispensing-of-plan-b-are-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Washington law requiring pharmacists to dispense Plan B violated pharmacists' freedom of religion rights. In 2009 the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the FDA's decision to limit Plan B to women 18 years or older. The court ordered the FDA to make Plan B available to 17-year-olds without a prescription. In March 2008, a federal judge in the US District Court of the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians' group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the OTC sale of Plan B. In November 2007, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a Washington state law that would have required pharmacists to dispense the Plan B pill. In October 2007, Illinois pharmacists considered a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral objections to the contraception. Plan B contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that immobilizes sperm, reduces the number of sperm cells in the uterine cavity and prevents further sperm from entering the uterine cavity. The hormone can delay or prevent ovulation from occurring and is most effective when taken immediately after unprotected intercourse.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Lumina, "more than ten percent of the population in Greece now lives in extreme poverty, and unemployment amongst youth has reached an unprecedented rate of 59.3 percent." He also voiced grave concern for the Greek health system finding that long term unemployment has left one third of the population without public health insurance. Lumina expressed support for newly created anti-racism police units and special prosecutor necessary to combat increased attacks on Greece's immigrant population by extremist groups. This is not the first time Lumina has come out in opposition of austerity measures in Greece. In 2012 Lumina <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-warns-greece-austerity-could-harm-basic-human-rights.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Greece that implementation of previous austerity measures to solve its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">economic crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] could result in serious violations of basic human rights. His final findings and his recommendations will be presented in a comprehensive report to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014

<p>In January Greece's <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/">Hellenic Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/greece-parliament-approves-new-tax-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new tax legislation on so that the country can pay back loans so that it can continue receiving financial aid. In October The <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/council-of-europe-rules-against-greece-labor-reform-measures.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that two labor reforms adopted by Greece as part of wider efforts to curb the nation's financial crises were illegal. The Council's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eurozone-greece-court-idUSBRE89H1M420121018">non-binding ruling</a> [Reuters report] concerned two measures passed by the Greek .government in 2010 at the urging of the country's international creditors. In February 2012 The Greek Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/greece-parliament-approves-austerity-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] austerity measures securing a second bailout for the country to avoid bankruptcy amidst rioting and violence in downtown Athens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19303869">Rakhine Investigation Commission</a> [BBC backgrounder] was set up last year by the country's president to look into longstanding tension and violence between Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State. Quintana praised recommendations to increase dialogue between the ethnic and religious communities and address living conditions in the Muslim camps for internally displaced people (IDP). Alongside praise the special rapporteur urged, "the authorities, as a matter of urgency, to ease the harsh and disproportionate restrictions on the freedom of movement of Muslim populations in the IDP camps and also in Muslim residential areas." Most pressingly Quintana expressed a need for increased accountability of government security forces in the area citing, "credible allegations that widespread and systematic human rights violations by state officials targeted against the Rohingya and wider Muslim populations have occurred and are continuing in Rakhine State." An advanced unedited copy of the special rapporteur's most recent <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.58_AUV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on the situation in Myanmar is available. 

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a statement demanding that the Myanmar government investigate and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/myanmar-government-urged-to-provide-justice-for-attacks-on-muslim-community.php">hold accountable</a> [JURIST report] those involved in the deadly violence in the Mandalay Region in March, in which an estimated 40 people were killed and 61 more were wounded. Also in April Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">expressed serious concerns</a> [JURIST report] in a report on growing violence between Muslim and Buddhist communities in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that government inaction has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country. In March Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-expert-urges-myanmar-to-address-remaining-issues.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the country of the possibility that the current reformation process may be endangered by leaving areas of importance untouched, especially related to the states of Rakhine and Kachin. He made similar calls in February when he <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-expert-calls-on-myanmar-to-address-ongoing-human-rights-issues.php">condemned the lack of reform</a> [JURIST report] that has been achieved in Myanmar and urged authorities and citizens to address issues of truth, justice and accountability through the creation of a truth commission to facilitate the process of national reconciliation and prevent future human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, which makes Maryland the eighteenth US state to repeal the death penalty, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-legislature-approves-bill-banning-death-penalty.php">approved by the state legislature</a> [JURIST report] in March. Prior to the bill, Maryland's capital punishment laws were among the most restrictive in the country. <a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2009rs/chapters_noln/Ch_186_sb0279T.pdf">Senate Bill 279</a> [text, PDF], which was signed into law in 2009, prevented a judge from imposing the death penalty unless one of three factors existed: DNA evidence, a videotaped confession or a videotaped murder. Even before the restrictions were passed, Maryland had only executed five people since 1976.

<p>O'Malley announced in January that he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/maryland-governor-to-introduce-death-penalty-repeal-legislation.php">file legislation to repeal capital punishment</a> [JURIST report] in Maryland, stating that the death penalty is expensive and ineffective.

Outside of Maryland, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST report] became the seventeenth state to abolish the death penalty and the fifth to do so in the previous five years. <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports] have all recently eliminated the death penalty, while 32 states retain its use, according to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> [advocacy website].

The court ruled 5-2 that officers were permitted to confiscate the defendant's cell phone, but that they should have obtained a warrant before looking at pictures on the phone. Justice Lewis wrote for the majority, "[w]e refuse to authorize government intrusion into the most private and personal details of an arrestee&#8217;s life without a search warrant simply because the cellular phone device which stores that information is small enough to be carried on one&#8217;s person." The ruling overturns the decision of the 1st District Court of Appeal, which found the search of the phone to be legal.

<p>Courts have been split on this issue. In December <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/massachusetts-top-court-allows-police-to-search-cell-phones-without-warrants.php">police do not need a warrant</a> [JURIST report] to search a suspect's cell phone once the suspect been lawfully arrested. In March of last year the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a warrantless search of a suspect's cell phone to collect its phone number does <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/seventh-circuit-upholds-warrantless-cell-phone-search.php">not constitute a violation</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] protections against unreasonable search and seizure. In 2011 the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] ruled that law enforcement officers <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/california-high-court-rules-no-warrant-needed-to-search-cell-phone-text-messages.php">can legally search</a> [JURIST report] text messages on a suspect's cell phone without a warrant incident to a lawful custodial arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Holder, <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/sb102/">SB 102</a> [materials], also known as the "Second Amendment Protection Act," "directly conflicts with federal law, and is therefore unconstitutional." The law prohibits federal officials from enforcing federal regulations with respect to firearms in Kansas. Holder's letter was sent April 26, one day after the law entered into force. In a <a href="http://www.mainjustice.com/files/2013/05/Eric-Holder-response-05.02.13.pdf">response</a> dated May 2, Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] said, "[t]he people of Kansas have clearly expressed their sovereign will. It is my hope that upon further review, you will see their right to do so."

<p>Gun control has been the center of national attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December. In March a Kansas legislative committee approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kansas-lawmakers-approve-open-carry-and-transportation-law-for-firearms.php">allow the open carry</a> [JURIST report] and transport of firearms around the state. In April the Maryland Senate gave final approval to a bill that imposes <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">tougher restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on obtaining a license to buy a firearm and bans certain types of rifles. Also last month Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a comprehensive gun control bill into law, placing new limits on the sale of firearms. In March Colorado Governor Hickenlooper <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] three bills mandating background checks for gun transfers and prohibiting the sale of large magazines. In January President Barack Obama signed <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was signed shortly after the House of Representatives approved it by a vote of <a href="http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/HVotes/votereport.asp?id=10153">56 to 15</a> [vote tally] earlier that day, finally passing the legislation that was first introduced in Rhode Island in 1997. Just last week, Rhode Island's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rhode-island-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">voted 26 to 12 in favor</a> of the law. The House had <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/rhode-island-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">passed its own version of the bill</a> [JURIST report] in January, and adopted the Senate's amendments to the bill with Thursday's vote. 

<p>Same-sex marriage is now legal in 10 states, as well as the District of Columbia. In March the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two same-sex marriage cases. The first case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [JURIST report], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In the second case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December. Both cases could have an important impact on the ongoing same-sex marriage controversy in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges.

In a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13284&LangID=E">statement</a> [press release] following the visit, Working Group members noted that federal and state government agencies have been making notable efforts to address human rights challenges related to business, but significant gaps remain in regulation and enforcement. Praiseworthy action included stricter disclosure requirements, efforts against human trafficking, forced, and child labor, and raising awareness of the Guiding Principles among businesses and civil society. Of concern were allegations of unfair labor practices such as restricting the freedom of association, violating minimum wage legislation, and a chronic disregard for minimum health and safety measures. Findings indicate that the legal and regulatory framework provides too many loopholes, weak deterrents to illegal activity and little incentive for businesses to behave responsibly in a supply chain. The members stated:<blockquote>With a few exceptions, most companies still struggle to understand the implications of the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. Those that do have policies in place, in turn face the challenge of turning such policies into effective practices. ... Much more awareness-raising and education needs to take place. Effective implementation of the Guiding Principles by companies requires first and foremost a good understanding of the processes involved, mobilization of significant buy-in and commitment from the top of a company.</blockquote>Detailed observations and recommendations will be presented by the Working Group in a report to the Human Rights Council in June 2014. 

<p>Business' effect on human rights is a growing concern in the international community.

Mueen-Uddin is alleged to have been a member of the Islamic militant group Al-Badr, which identified and killed pro-independence activists. Another alleged Al-Badr member, US citizen Ashrafuzzaman Khan, was also accused and is facing the same charges. An arrest warrant was issued in Dhaka on Thursday for both men. Their case is due back in the courts on May 12, and officials say a request for their extradition could be made. The men could face the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22379398">death penalty for their alleged crimes</a> [BBC report], but, under British law, a person cannot be extradited if facing capital punishment.

<p>The ICTB has been controversial since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established</a> [JURIST report] by Bangladeshi officials in 2010 to investigate and prosecute crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder].

Heyns stated that establishing a strong law enforcement system consistent with international law is the solution to  violence problems currently plaguing Mexico. He  stressed that civil courts, rather than military ones, should try members of the accused committing human rights violations and suggested establishing clear standards on when law enforcement officials may use force. Additionally, Heyns emphasized the need to end impunity: <blockquote>Each and every loss of life should be investigated with the same rigor. And each and every perpetrator should be apprehended and tried. Pursuing this objective will serve not only to decrease impunity, but to restore the value that society attaches to life.</blockquote> Heyns said that the international community is eager to work with Mexico in further protecting human rights.

<p>In March Mexico's <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/inicio.htm">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/mexico-legislature-votes-to-remove-criminal-immunity-for-lawmakers.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to remove criminal immunity for federal lawmakers, seeking to subject federal senators and deputies to the criminal justice system. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/mexico-security-forces-participated-in-forced-disappearances-hrw.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Mexican security forces have enforced or participated in at least 250 "disappearances" in which individuals are taken against their will since 2007. In July 2012 the <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/peacestudies/tbi/">Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego</a> (TBI) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/report-urges-mexico-authorities-to-investigate-human-rights-violations.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that human rights violations committed by Mexico's military forces were on the rise, and alleged that these violations were occurring with impunity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill also increases the sites where early voting can be held, permitting election supervisors to use more and larger sites for early voting. In addition, the bill moves the presidential primary to a time that complies with national party rules. The bill <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2013/05/04/legislature-passes-bill-allowing-more-early-voting.html">addresses long lines and counting delays in Florida</a> [Columbus Dispatch report].

<p>Early voting has been a thorny political issue, particularly in the 2012 elections. In September 2012 the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rejects-ohio-early-voting-appeal.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a stay application in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12a338.htm">Husted v. Obama for America</a> [docket], and allowed early voting for all Ohio citizens in the three days preceding the November election. President Barack Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Convention (DNC) challenged the law, which restricted early voting to active duty military members, as a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because of its alleged impact on the <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of certain groups of voters.

Melissa and Heather Gartner sued the IDPH after officials refused to include the name of their child's non-biological parent on the child's birth certificate unless the non-biological parent adopted the child. The Gartners are legally married in Iowa, a state that <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">legalized gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. The Iowa Supreme Court found that the agency did not have the authority to interpret <a href="http://www.idph.state.ia.us/genetics/common/pdf/gen_chapter44.pdf">Iowa's Parentage Statute</a> [Iowa Code 144.13, PDF]. After a detailed analysis, the court held that "with respect to the government's purpose of identifying a child as part of their family and providing a basis for verifying the birth of a child, married lesbian couples are similarly situated to spouses and parents in an opposite-sex marriage." This case reached the state's Supreme Court after the IDPH appealed from a <a href="http://www.iowacourtsonline.org/District_Courts/">District Court </a>[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iowa-court-orders-both-same-sex-parents-be-included-on-birth-certificate.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] ordering the agency to include both names of married same-sex parents on children's birth certificates. Upon this decision, JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.slu.edu/colleges/law/slulaw/faculty/mziegle6">Mary Ziegler </a>[academic profile] of Saint Louis University School of Law <a href="/forum/2012/01/mary-ziegler-parental-rights.php">warned</a> [JURIST op-ed] that while that court decision may be a victory for the rights of same-sex parents, the arguments made in the public debate surrounding the case demonstrate a break from the goals of the early gay rights movement and could be used to justify discrimination against other forms of non-traditional families.

<p>The rights of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same+sex">same-sex couples</a> [JURIST news archive] remain a controversial issue in the US. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 10 states, as well as the District of Columbia. In March the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two same-sex marriage cases. The first case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [JURIST report], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In the second case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If voted into effect, it would cover anyone who held an official position from Gaddafi's first day in power in September 1969 through October 23, 2011, and would be valid for five years. Zeidan, the leader of the congress, his deputy, and around 40 other members could be barred from the current administration if the draft passes. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/04/libya-reject-political-isolation-law">criticized the law</a> [press release] and urged the GNC to vote down the latest draft, saying that the "provisions and procedures for exclusion are too sweeping and vague" and that "a recent amendment to the provisional constitution would prohibit judicial review of the law."  The Libyan Congress has deliberated the bill for months and a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/libya-tense-ahead-vote-former-gaddafi-officials-122642226.html">vote is expected</a> [Reuters report] this afternoon. 

<p>Libya has attempted other sanctions for those related to the Gaddafi regime, such as Libya's ongoing attempt to try Gaddafi's son, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14617511">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, and former Libyan intelligence chief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profiles], rather than turn them over to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. On Thursday, Saif al-Islam made a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/gaddafis-son-makes-second-appearance-in-libya-court.php">second court appearance</a> [JURIST report] in Zintan, Libya, but the court postponed further proceedings until mid-September in order to allow for adequate trial preparation. In April, HRW reported that Al-Senussi had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-former-libya-intelligence-chief-held-without-access-to-lawyer.php">unable to speak with a lawyer</a> or told what charges he faces during his eight-month detention, despite February's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">order from the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] to Libyan officials to hand over al-Senussi so that he could meet with a lawyer. In January the ICC asked Libya to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-asks-libya-to-explain-plans-to-try-gaddafi-son.php">address reports</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to try Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi. Last October Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to allow the men to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. Last June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained by Libyan security forces</a> [JURIST report] and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released. The ICC issued arrest warrants for both men in June 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law will take effect on July 29. Opponents stated that the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/phoenix-gun-buybacks-set-law-forces-sales-19110368#.UYaCL7XEolM">law was counterproductive</a> [AP report] because the key goal was to reduce the number of guns on the street, but also implied that the law was so full of loopholes that buyback events may still be able to prevent the guns from returning to the public. Proponents stated that the law was a resource for the government to bring in revenue and that destruction of the guns is a waste of government funds. Police estimated receiving more than 800 guns at Saturday's buyback and each weapon will have its serial number checked and undergo ballistics testing to see if it is tied to a shooting. 

<p>Gun control has been the center of national attention since the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">Newtown, Connecticut shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] in December. On Friday US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-warns-kansas-on-new-gun-law.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Kansas that a recently enacted law intended to block enforcement of federal gun regulations was unconstitutional. In March a Kansas legislative committee approved a bill that would allow the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kansas-lawmakers-approve-open-carry-and-transportation-law-for-firearms.php">open carry</a> [JURIST report] and transport of firearms around the state. In April the Maryland Senate gave final approval to a bill that imposes <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">tougher restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on obtaining a license to buy a firearm and bans certain types of rifles. Also last month Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a comprehensive gun control bill into law, placing new limits on the sale of firearms. In March Colorado Governor Hickenlooper <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] three bills mandating background checks for gun transfers and prohibiting the sale of large magazines. In January President Barack Obama signed <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/obama-calls-for-stricter-gun-control-measures.php">23 executive orders</a> [JURIST report] intended to strengthen existing gun laws and urged congress to take up gun control measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In January, Cameron <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-prime-minister-proposes-referendum-on-eu-membership.php">promised</a> [JURIST report] that if his party were to win the next election in 2015, the Tories would then push legislation for the referendum by the end of 2015 which would be held by 2017. This push by members of the <a href=http://www.conservatives.com/">Conservative Party</a> to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10037888/Twenty-Tory-MPs-demand-Europe-referendum-bill.html">expedite</a> [Telegraph report] a nationwide referendum is a response to the results from local elections earlier this month that saw the upstart <a href="http://www.ukip.org/">UK Independence Party</a> (UKIP) [party websites] receiving <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1086321/local-council-elections-ukip-make-big-gains">26% of the polls</a> [Sky News report]. The UKIP's primary platform initiatives focus on cutting immigration and removing UK ties to the EU have struck a nerve with many conservative UK voters worried about globalism's impact on British sovereignty and their economy. UKIP's successes this year came largely at the expense of the ruling Tory party.

<p>In October 2011, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] voted 483-111 <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-parliament-votes-down-referendum-on-eu-membership.php">against holding a national referendum</a> [JURIST report] on remaining an EU member. In that proposal, the referendum would have put forward three options for a vote: to remain in the EU, to leave the EU, or to re-negotiate membership terms. In 1975, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm">UK held a referendum</a> [BBC backgrounder] to determine whether to leave the European Economic Community (EEC).

The crimes were committed during an attack on police in the Shiite village of Sitra which has been a hotbed of anti-government protests since 2011. The accused protesters <a href="http://rt.com/news/bahrain-issues-31-sentences-837/">claimed</a> [RT report] that they are innocent of the charges and that torture was used to secure confessions from some of the protesters.

<p>In October of last year, the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] issued to nine medics for allegedly participating in the March of 2011 anti-government protests. Twenty medics, including 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics, were originally jailed and sentenced in September 2011 for providing treatment to injured protesters after the Salmaniya Medical Complex was stormed by security forces in March. Though originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, a Bahrain court in June 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bahrain-court-r.php">overturned or reduced the sentences</a> [JURIST report] for most of the medical professionals. In November King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission</a> [JURIST report] to make recommendations after the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) concluded in a report that Bahraini authorities <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">used excessive force</a> [JURIST report] and tortured detained protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Current officials who lose their post will be replaced by either the party's next name in line or by the district's candidate who came in second. The law covers officials from Gaddafi's entire 42-year regime. Critics <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/libya-passes-ban-gadhafi-era-officials">claim the vote was undemocratic</a> [AP report] since it took place under the threat of violence from militias and criticize the law itself for precluding judicial review. The law was also <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/libya-congress-to-vote-on-ban-of-gaddafi-regime-officials-from-new-administration.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] because the "provisions and procedures for exclusion are too sweeping and vague."

<p>Libya has attempted other sanctions for those related to the Gaddafi regime, such as the ongoing attempt to try Gaddafi's son, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14617511">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, and former Libyan intelligence chief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profiles], rather than turn them over to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Last week, Saif al-Islam made a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/gaddafis-son-makes-second-appearance-in-libya-court.php">second court appearance</a> [JURIST report] in Zintan, Libya, but the court postponed further proceedings until mid-September in order to allow for adequate trial preparation. In April, HRW reported that Al-Senussi had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-former-libya-intelligence-chief-held-without-access-to-lawyer.php">unable to speak with a lawyer</a> or told what charges he faces during his eight-month detention, despite February's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">order from the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] to Libyan officials to hand over al-Senussi so that he could meet with a lawyer.

Her two presumed accomplices died in an apparent murder-suicide in November 2011, after which Zschaepe turned herself in. There are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/high-profile-german-neo-nazi-trial-opens-munich-090503217.html">four other male defendants</a> [AP report] accused of aiding the NSU. Although Zschaepe will not have to make a pleading until the end of the trial, her lawyers have indicated that she will remain silent during the trial and will contest the charges. Her lawyers have also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/06/us-germany-neonazi-idUSBRE9440ER20130506">challenged the impartiality of the judge</a> [Reuters report] for ordering searches of them but not of other participants entering the court. If convicted, Zschaepe faces life in prison. The trial is scheduled to last more than a year, but has been temporarily been put on hold due to Judge Manfred Goetzl deciding that he should recuse himself by May 14.

<p>Besides Germany, several countries have faced issues dealing with neo-nazi movements and propaganda. In January an Austrian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/austria-court-convicts-three-neo-nazis-for-glorifying-nazism.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three neo-Nazis of glorifying Nazism over the Internet, sentencing them to as many as nine years in prison. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/ts/principal.htm">Supreme Court of Spain</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/spain-high-court-overturns-convictions-of-Nazi-propaganda-disseminators.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of four individuals charged with distributing neo-Nazi propaganda, reasoning that disseminating Nazi ideology is not a crime unless used to incite violence or certain danger, or create a hostile climate. In July 2010 a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-jails-neo-nazis-for-hate-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 neo-Nazis, including a group leader and several teenagers, to jail terms for committing hate crimes against ethnic minorities in the country. Also in 2010 a criminal court in France <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-court-convicts-neo-nazi-group.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of a neo-nazi group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The use of injunctions on mobile phone standard-essential patents can be considered abusive when the potential licensee is willing to enter into a license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. Such moves generally involve a prohibition to sell the product infringing on the patent, which could distort licensing negotiations and impose unjustified licensing terms on the patent licensees. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/almunia/about/mandate/index_en.htm">Joaquin Almunia</a> [official profile], Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy, said of this style of patent abuse:<blockquote>The protection of intellectual property is a cornerstone of innovation and growth. But so is competition. I think that companies should spend their time innovating and competing on the merits of the products they offer&#8212;not misusing their intellectual property rights to hold up competitors to the detriment of innovation and consumer choice.
</blockquote>The sending of a Statement of Objections does not prejudge the final outcome of the investigation, nor does it question the availability of injunctive relief for standard-essential patent-holders outside the specific circumstances present in this case.

<p>The Statement of Objections is the latest of Motorola's legal battles. The US International Trade Commission (USITC)  ruled in April that <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/motorola-loses-sensor-patent-case-with-apple--done.php">Apple did not infringe a Motorola patent</a> [JURIST report] covering proximity sensors, stating that the concept at issue was too obvious to merit patent protection. In February, a US District Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-restricts-google-patent-lawsuit-against-microsoft.php">restricted a patent lawsuit by Motorola</a> [JURIST report] against Microsoft, ruling that certain parts of three different Motorola patents were not valid. In January, Motorola <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/googles-motorola-mobility-drops-two-key-patent-challenges-from-case-against-microsoft.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] with the ITC to drop two key patents from it case against Microsoft. The claim alleged that Microsoft infringed on Motorola Mobility's patents related to technology used in the Xbox. The withdrawal of the claim was required in an agreement Google made with the Federal Trade Commission. In December, the ITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-trade-commission-rules-for-apple-in-patent-dispute-with-google.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Apple in a patent dispute with Google.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senegal and the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/senegal-adopts-law-creating-special-tribunal-for-former-chad-dictator.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] in December to set up the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/113271">Extraordinary African Chambers</a> [statute, in French], which has a budget of &#8364;7.4 million (USD $9.7 million) to try Habre for allegations of crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture during his time in power between 1982 and 1990, where rights groups report that some 40,000 people were killed.

<p>Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre, who has been been under house arrest there since 2005. In March lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmarijuana.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S198638.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously Monday that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. The court concluded that California's medical marijuana statutes, the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=hsc&group=11001-12000&file=11357-11362.9">Compassionate Use Act of 1996</a> (CUA) [text] and <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/mmp/Pages/default.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [official website] do not preempt a local ban on facilities that distribute medical marijuana. Riverside declared, by zoning ordinances, that medical marijuana dispensaries are a prohibited use of land within the city and may be abated as a public nuisance. The court uphold the ordinances:<blockquote>We have consistently maintained that the CUA and the MMP are but incremental steps toward freer access to medical marijuana, and the scope of these statutes is limited and circumscribed. They merely declare that the conduct they describe cannot lead to arrest or conviction, or be abated as a nuisance, as violations of enumerated provisions of the Health and Safety code. Nothing in the CUA or the MMP expressly or impliedly limits the inherent authority of a local jurisdiction, by its own ordinances, to regulate the 
use of its land, including the authority to provide that facilities for the distribution of medical marijuana will not be permitted to operate within its borders. We must therefore reject defendants' preemption argument, and must affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</blockquote>The court also noted that the CUA and the MMP have no effect on the federal enforceability of the law in California. 

<p>The sale and use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. In February the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/Pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled that the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] and <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives. Similarly, medical marijuana was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts</a> [Harvard Crimson report] for the first time, as over 60 percent of voters approved a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">similar referendum</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2011 the NLRB <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nlrb-orders-union-rights-posted-in-us-businesses.php">issued a regulation</a> [JURIST report] requiring employers to post their employees' rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/usc_sup_01_29_10_7_20_II.html">National Labor Relations Act</a> [text]. These rights include the right to unionize, to bargain collectively and to refuse pressures to do either. The poster also gives some examples of unfair business and union practices and information on contacting the NLRB. The <a href="http://www.nam.org/">National Association of Manufacturers</a> (NAM) [advocacy website] filed a challenge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], which <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16353544551378596655">upheld</a> [opinion] the NLRB's requirement but ruled that failure to post could not be considered an unfair labor practice. On appeal, the DC Circuit vacated the rule, finding that "all three of the means for enforcing the Board's posting requirement are invalid." The NAM <a href="http://www.nam.org/Communications/Articles/2013/05/Manufacturers-Win-in-Fight-Against-NLRB-Overreach.aspx">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release] as "an important victory in the fight against an activist NLRB and its aggressive agenda."

<p>A similar challenge to the rule was filed in the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website], which <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=910666983282096484&q=Chamber+of+Commerce+v.+National+Labor+Relations+Board&hl=en&as_sdt=4,159">held</a> [opinion] that the NLRB was incapable of enacting the new rules entirely because the NLRA neither required nor provided for such regulation. An appeal is currently pending before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website]. JURIST Guest Columnist Chris Schlag <a href="/dateline/2012/04/chris-schlag-nlra.php">argued in favor of the rule</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year, finding that open communication is the foundation of a healthy and fair employment environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law currently maintains that retailers must have a physical presence in the state to collect sales taxes. Thus, many Internet retailers have an advantage with tax-free online sales. Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the <a href="http://www.nrf.com/">National Retail Federation</a> [advocacy website] supporting the bill, highlights: "Small retailers are collecting sales tax on the first dollar of any sale they make, and it's only fair that other retailers who are selling to those same customers the same product have those same obligations." However online retail giants such as <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> [official websites] strongly oppose the bill, as do leaders from Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. As these states do not have sales taxes, they argue that businesses in their states should not have to collect taxes for other states. The bill has bipartisan favor, but a number of issues remain to be addressed as Internet tax becomes increasingly relevant.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=commerce+clause">commerce clause</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a hot topic recently. In March, the New York high court  <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/new-york-high-court-rules-state-can-collect-sales-tax-from-out-of-state-companies.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state may impose a sales tax on out-of-state retailers that do business within the state. At issue in the case was a 2008 state tax law known as the <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/assets/attachments/3711.pdf">Internet Tax</a> [text, PDF], which places a sales tax on out-of-state online businesses that generate at least $10,000 in annual sales to New Yorkers from in-state websites. Last June, the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">high-profile ruling</a> [text, PDF; <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">JURIST report</a>] to uphold the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] sparked major controversy. A month later, JURIST guest columnist Robin West <a href="/forum/2012/07/robin-west-aca-roberts.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Chief Justice Roberts's conviction that the individual mandate is not authorized by the commerce clause is evidence of a new, anti-collectivist conception of individual rights that is growing in popularity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Hans Lipschis, who was deported from the US in 1983 for lying about his Nazi affiliations, has <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/germany-arrests-alleged-former-auschwitz-guard-a-898490.html">acknowledged</a> [<em>Speigel</em> report] being assigned to an SS guard unit, but maintains he only worked as a cook. However, compelling evidence was found that he was involved in the crimes at Auschwitz while posted there from 1941 to 1945. While Lipschis is in detention, prosecutors will try to determine what he did while working at Auschwitz. Although there may be little to no evidence linking Lipschis to a specific crime, new German law allows prosecutors to charge any person who worked at a death camp with accessory to murder because the sole purpose of the camp was to kill people. A doctor has confirmed that Lipschis' health is good enough to remain detained while awaiting his charges. 

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, German prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] hundreds of investigations involving former death camp guards after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] in May 2011 for the murder of thousands during the holocaust. Like Lipschis, Demjanjuk was also deported from the US. Demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in prison but was released early due to old age and died in September 2011 while <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/accused-hungary-nazi-dies-while-awaiting-appeal.php">awaiting an appeal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPCESCR.aspx">Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (Protocol) [text] requires that after the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cescr/">Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (Committee) [official website] examines a complaint, it must transit its views, as well as recommendations, to the parties concerned. The state party must then give due consideration to the committee's views and recommendations and submit a written response within six months, setting forth any action it has taken. 

<p>The protocol was created to condemn violations of rights to food, adequate housing, education, or health, as is the standard for civil and political rights violations. Uruguay was the tenth required country to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-welcomes-mechanism-for-individuals-to-report-human-rights-abuses.php">ratify the protocol</a> [JURIST report], joining Argentina, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain. UN High Commissioner <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has requested that the other 160 nations in the UN also ratify the protocol. Some critics have suggested the opt-in nature for the protocol means that many suspect nations will not be governed by the instrument, leaving those people most in danger of rights abuses with no change in their means to report those abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/brazil-company-challenges-florida-ban-on-business-dealings-with-cuba-syria.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] last year by <a href="http://www.odebrecht.com/">Odebrecht Construction</a> [corporate website, in Portuguese], a Brazilian company that would be affected by the legislation. A judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-blocks-florida-law-barring-contracts-for-business-tied-to-cuba-syria.php">temporarily blocked the law</a> last June, and the state of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-to-appeal-decision-allowing-contracts-with-cuba-syria-businesses.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports]. The Eleventh Circuit upheld the ruling:<blockquote>After careful review, we conclude that Odebrecht has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its claim that the Cuba Amendment violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution under principles of conflict preemption. ... The Cuba Amendment conflicts directly with the extensive and highly calibrated federal regime of sanctions against Cuba promulgated by the legislative and executive branches over almost fifty years. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution "provides a clear rule that federal law 'shall be the supreme Law of the Land.'" ... The Cuba Amendment differs dramatically from the federal regime as to the entities covered, the actions triggering sanctions, and the penalties imposed. The Amendment also overrides the nuances of the federal law and weakens the President's ability "to speak for the Nation with one voice in dealing" with Cuba. ... In addition, Odebrecht has demonstrated the other equitable requirements that warrant a preliminary injunction: Odebrecht would have suffered irreparable harm absent the injunction, the balance of harms strongly favored the injunction, and the injunction did not disserve the public interest.</blockquote>Odebrecht could now ask the lower court to <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/05/06/v-fullstory/3383474/federal-appeals-court-florida.html">make the injunction permanent</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report], or Florida could seek a ruling on the merits.

<p>Cuba-US relations have improved in recent years. In 2011 US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Departments of <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury</a> and <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Homeland Security</a> [official websites] to take steps to ease restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba. The new regulations were expected to allow greater travel from the US to Cuba for religious and educational purposes, the transfer of up to $2000 per year to non-family members in Cuba so long as they are not senior government or Communist Party leaders, and all US international airports to service charter flights between the two countries. In 2009 Obama ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/obama-administration-eases-cuba-travel.php">lifting of travel restrictions and restrictions on money transfers</a> [JURIST report] between Cuban-Americans and their families in Cuba in 2009. Obama also ordered that US telecommunications companies be allowed to work within Cuba to facilitate communication between families split between the two countries. The plan was put forward as not only necessary for the interests of the families, but also as way to bolster a democratic movement within Cuba.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The BiH war crimes court, established in 2002, has continued to prosecute those accused of atrocities during the Balkans conflict of the early 1990s.

The court held that the law's diversion of funds from the Minimum Foundation Program (MFP) to non-public schools violated <a href="http://senate.legis.state.la.us/documents/constitution/Article8.htm#%C2%A713.%20Funding;%20Apportionment">Article VIII, Section 13(B)</a> [text] of the Louisiana Constitution, which requires the state to allocate funds to public schools according to a formula. Additionally, the court held that the law was not legally approved by the legislature since it only received 51 of the 53 required votes in the state House. Louisiana <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/">Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website] is a strong supporter of the school voucher plan and helped <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/louisiana-supreme-court-voucher-funding-unconstitutional-91013.html">push the bill through</a> [AP report] the state legislature.

<p>School voucher programs have been controversial over the past decade. <a href="http://www.nea.org/">Opponents of school vouchers</a> [NEA advocacy website] argue that such programs do not achieve their stated goal of expanding educational opportunities and that they undermine public education. In March the Indiana Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/indiana-supreme-court-upholds-school-voucher-program.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's school voucher program. In 2008 an appeals court in Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/arizona-appeals-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's school voucher program. In 2006 the Florida Supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/florida-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] that state's school voucher law, which was signed into law by then-governor Jeb Bush. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay expressed concern that if the law places significant constraints on civil society organizations, it would undermine the cause of the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] at a crucial moment for the country. Pillay also noted that the new constitution is concentrating power in the executive branch at the expense of the judiciary and that this concentration of power "risks undermining the independence of the judiciary. Pillay stated that her office will continue to follow the development of the proposed law, which has gone through a number of drafts. 

<p>Egypt has experienced continued unrest and instability since the 2011 revolution. Last month a number of Egyptian opposition groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-opposition-files-lawsuit-demanding-public-debate-of-budget.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] demanding public debate of the country's budget. Earlier in April Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-upper-house-approves-new-election-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new election procedures to elect the House of Representatives. The process has been delayed, however, by Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referring</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed law to the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) for review. The court's decision was said to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-egypt-elections-court-idUSBRE9250S320130306">based on technical grounds</a> [Reuters report], namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was amended in five key areas as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">demanded by the high court</a> [JURIST report]. in March, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jwDcwyM8n0gy3XvZXqVBGp0lySFw?docId=CNG.feaf99808e07209bf669127e7046e006.e81">claims</a> [AFP report] Congolese military troops raped at least 97 women and 33 girls, some as young as 6, in villages and towns surrounding the besieged eastern city of Goma. M23 rebels had overtaken the city during a 10-day occupation, forcing Congolese troops into the outskirts of the city. Based on more than 350 interviews with witnesses and victims, the report claims that DRC troops retreated to Minova in South Kivu province where they were seen raping, looting and arbitrarily beating and executing villagers. Investigators claim that these attacks were carried out in a systematic manner and with extreme violence. The 391st battalion, a segment of the Congolese military that has been implicated in these wrongdoings, was <a href="http://www.trust.org/item/20130508115958-g40re/">trained by the US</a> [Reuters report] in 2010. Following these claims the US Department of Defense said last month that, regardless of which unit is accused, these crimes were condemnable and potential grounds for withdrawal. 

<p>DRC and M23 forces have previously faced accusations of war crimes and human rights violations. In February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-war-crimes-committed-by-m23-and-congolese-forces.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that during the siege of Goma M23 forces summarily executed 24 individuals, 21 of which were civilians, and also raped at least 36 women, including 18 wives and a 10-year-old girl. In November the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned M23</a> [JURIST report] for guerrilla attacks on the DRC and called for an immediate end to all support of the group. In June a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">leaked UN report</a> [JURIST report] revealed that Rwanda had been helping to create and support M23 and similar rebel groups that have been known to violate human rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Prosecutor-statement-to-UNSC-08-May-2013.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] to the UN Security Council on the situation in Libya, Fatou Bensouda prosecutor noted that the ICC's mandate is still essential to ending impunity in Libya, given the extensive crimes committed and the challenges facing the new Libyan government after the fall of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] regime and the transition toward a modern democratic state. The prosecutor stressed Libya's impact on international justice:<blockquote>Libya is engaged in the development of the law: irrespective of outcome, the admissibility processes underway at the ICC will set the standard for years to come for how the Court and States interact with each other regarding national proceedings. ... By conducting fair, just, and transparent judicial proceedings for all alleged perpetrators, while also continuing to respect the ICC judicial process, Libya can set a lasting example for other States.</blockquote>

<p>Libya is seeking to try Gaddafi's son <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14617511">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> and former intelligence chief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profiles] domestically rather than turn them over to the ICC. Last week Saif al-Islam <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/gaddafis-son-makes-second-appearance-in-libya-court.php">made a second court appearance</a> [JURIST report] in Zintan, Libya, but the court postponed further proceedings until mid-September in order to allow for adequate trial preparation. In April Human Rights Watch reported that Al-Senussi had been <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-former-libya-intelligence-chief-held-without-access-to-lawyer.php">unable to speak with a lawyer</a> or told what charges he faces during his eight-month detention, despite February's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">order from the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] to Libyan officials to hand over al-Senussi so that he could meet with a lawyer. In January the ICC asked Libya to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/icc-asks-libya-to-explain-plans-to-try-gaddafi-son.php">address reports</a> [JURIST report] that it planned to try Saif al-Islam and al-Senussi. In June 2012 four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained by Libyan security forces </a>[JURIST report] and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released. The ICC issued arrest warrants for both men in June 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The justice also directed Pakistan's <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] to introduce a resolution against such attacks in the UN. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://www.rightsadvocacy.org/">Foundation for Fundamental Rights</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of those who have had family members killed in a drone strike. Khan said the drone strikes should be declared a war crime and that Pakistan should consider <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistan-court-declares-US-drone-strikes-as-illegal/articleshow/19968086.cms">breaking diplomatic ties</a> [PTI report] with the US if it vetoes its resolution in the UN. US officials maintain that the drone strikes target <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistani-court-declares-us-drone-strikes-in-the-countrys-tribal-belt-illegal-8609843.html">al Qaeda and Taliban fighters</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] who are responsible for cross-border attacks in Afghanistan and that the Pakistani has condoned strikes. 

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under scrutiny in recent months. In March a federal appeals court judge in the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling on CIA drone strikes and held that the CIA must respond to a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] claim filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] requesting records on the CIA's drone program. Also in March Attorney General Eric Holder wrote a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">letter</a> [JURIST report] to Senator Rand Paul suggesting that a drone strike on US soil would be legal only in extraordinary circumstances, following a lengthy filibuster by the senator in the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director. In January UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism Ben Emmerson announced that he will <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-rights-expert-announces-investigation-into-use-of-drone-strikes-by-us-and-other-nations.php">begin investigating</a> [JURIST report] the legality of the use of drone strikes. Following a request to allow an <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the use of targeted killings last year, Emmerson stated that there is still non consensus among the international community as to the legality of the conduct. Also in January Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Minister <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/pakistan-foreign-minister-condemns-us-drone-attacks.php#">condemned</a> [JURIST report] US drone attacks as a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and international law. In December the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/us-government-responds-to-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php#">filed a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Kamaruzzam, however, denies the charges and maintains that he is being sentenced by a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/05/2013595575783613.html">politicized court</a> [Al Jazeera report] because he is a member of the opposition party.

Under the new bill members of the Council of Magistrates, the board that appoints federal judges, will be elected. The <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/130586/senate-approves-council-of-magistrates-controversial-bill">reform</a> [<em>Buenos Aires Herald</em> report], although backed by <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/">President Cristina Fernandez</a> [official profile, in Spanish] and passed by both houses of congress, has been heavily criticized by those in the judiciary, with the National Chamber of Civil Appeals condemning it as a violation of the principle of judicial independence. Earlier this month, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-argentina-to-ensure-independence-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Argentina to ensure judicial independence by not passing this controversial bill. UN expert <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/GKnaul.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] expressed concern, saying, "Providing the opportunity for political parties to propose and organize the election of the members of the Judicial Council threatens their independence, thereby seriously jeopardizing the principles of separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, which constitute fundamental elements of any democracy and rule of the law." The bill is expected to be signed into law.

<p>Last month an Argentine appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/argentina-appeals-court-declares-media-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2009 media law backed by Fernandez as unconstitutional. The law was designed to dismantle media empire Clarin, which Fernandez claimed was trying to dismantle her government with biased reporting. The court decided that the law would unconstitutionally limit Clarin's rights and would impede the company's freedom of expression without benefiting the broader population.  </p>

This bill moves Minnesota a step towards become the twelfth US state to legalize gay marriage. The bill will have to pass in the Senate before becoming law, but most expected the House <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/us/minnesota-house-approves-same-sex-marriage.html">to be the toughest</a> [ NYT report] hurdle the bill would have to face. Governor Mark Dayton has supported the measure and has said that he would sign the bill.

In March the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two same-sex marriage cases. The first case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [JURIST report], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In the second case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the court examines the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December.

Pillay's urging came after a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/world/middleeast/syria-human-rights.html">series of massacres</a> [NYT report] were carried out against civilians, including young children, in al-Bayda and other areas over the past week. Pillay also voiced concern about the military build-up of government troops in western Syria and stated her view that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] should handle claims of war crimes by the Syrian government. Pillay welcomed the recent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22446159">cooperation between the US and Russia</a> [BBC report] regarding the conflict but emphasized that the international community "needs a much greater sense of urgency" when it comes to ending the conflict. Pillay's statement comes on the same day that Turkey claims it has evidence that Syria <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22484115">used chemical weapons</a> [BBC report], something US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] previously called a "red line" for intervention. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been going on since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile], and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Last month Assad issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/syria-president-reduces-prison-sentences-of-rebel-fighters.php">reducing prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for a number of rebel prisoners, but the move was dismissed as a "meaningless gesture" by activists. Also in April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused the Syrian Air Force of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in opposition-controlled areas. In March HRW accused Syria's military of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using widely-banned cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against civilians. In February the UN said that both the Syrian government and the anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years </a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000. In January more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria to the ICC</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Daniel Bekele, Africa director at HRW, called on the Seleka Coalition to end the abuses against civilians and stop "settling scores" with Central African Armed Forces (FACA) and said the new government should display its commitment to the rule of law by prosecuting those who perpetrated attacks against civilians. Authorities in the new government deny the claims and told HRW that the abuses were carried out by former members of Bozize's government who were falsely claiming to be Seleka members. In addition to calling on the CAR to restore law and order and prosecute those responsible, HRW urged the UN to investigate reports of abuses. 

<p>Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-condemns-abuses-in-central-african-republic.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights abuses in CAR.

Also in March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-sg-condemns-central-african-republic-coup.php">condemned the coup</a> [JURIST report] by the Seleka rebels and advocated for a "swift restoration of constitutional order." The African Union also condemned the coup and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-centralafrica-rebels-african-idUSBRE92O0DI20130325">suspended</a> [Reuters report] CAR from the Union in addition to imposing sanctions against the country. The CAR has also recently been criticized for its use of child soldiers. In January UNICEF said that it had received "credible reports" of both pro-government and rebel groups in the country <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/unicef-reports-recruitment-of-child-soldiers-in-central-african-republic.php">recruiting and including children in its conflict</a> [JURIST report].

Judge Edward Korman of the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">issued the order</a> [JURIST report] last month, citing a lack of scientific evidence to support age limits. Korman wrote Friday about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/health/judge-refuses-to-drop-order-on-contraceptive-pill-without-regard-to-age.html?_r=0">political motivations</a> [NYT report] behind the law, characterizing arguments from <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Health and Human Services</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official profile] as "frivolous" and "silly." Government lawyers had requested a stay on Korman's order, but he agreed only to delay its enforcement until Monday to allow them to take their request to the appeals court.  

<p>The Plan B contraceptive has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/fda-approves-over-counter-sale-of.php">winning approval</a> [JURIST report] from the FDA in 2006. In 2009 the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the FDA's decision to limit Plan B to women 18 years or older. The court ordered the FDA to make Plan B available to 17-year-olds without a prescription. In March 2008 a federal judge in the US District Court of the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians' group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the OTC sale of Plan B. In November 2007 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a Washington state law that would have required pharmacists to dispense the Plan B pill. In October 2007 Illinois pharmacists considered a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral objections to the contraception. Plan B contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that immobilizes sperm, reduces the number of sperm cells in the uterine cavity and prevents further sperm from entering the uterine cavity. The hormone can delay or prevent ovulation from occurring and is most effective when taken immediately after unprotected intercourse. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that Rios Montt was responsible for commanding his military forces to kill 5.5 percent of the Ixil population, who were deemed "domestic enemies of the state." He was also held responsible for failing to prevent or stop the military's "intended annihilation" of the Ixil Mayans. The three-judge panel headed by Judge Jasmine Barrios issued the verdict less than a day after the conclusion of this landmark trial and <a href="http://www.plazapublica.com.gt/content/rios-montt-es-condenado-por-genocidio-contra-ixiles">sentenced</a> [<em>Plaza Publica</em> report, in Spanish] Rios Montt to 80 years in prison&#8212;50 years for genocide and 30 years for other crimes against humanity. The court revoked Rios Montt's 2012 house arrest and has detained him in a military facility. Rios Montt's trial marks the first time a former head of state has been prosecuted for genocide in a national court. 

<p>Judge Patricia Flores, who was recused from the case in 2011, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-former-guatemala-leader-accused-of-genocide-halted.php">halted the trial</a> [JURIST report] and attempted to invalidate a year-and-a-half of court proceedings once she was reinstated last month. However, Barrios <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guatemala-judge-reverses-suspension-of-trial-against-former-president.php">continued the trial</a> [JURIST report] against Rios Montt despite the prior ruling annulling the case. In March the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">lauded</a> [JURIST report] Guatemala for beginning the trial against Rios Montt and for prosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity. Rios Montt was previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature. Rios Montt's trial began on March 19 after a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] him to stand trial last January. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An Egyptian appeals judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judge-overturns-former-egypt-presidents-conviction-orders-retrial.php">overturned Mubarak's conviction</a> and life sentence in January on those same charges, ordering a retrial. The next hearing is set for June 8 at which time the prosecution <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/11/egypt-mubarak-idUSL6N0DS05420130511">promises to offer new evidence</a> [Reuters report], including some taken from the report of a fact-finding committee set up by Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohamed+Morsi">news archive</a>].

<p>Mubarak and members of his government have been the subject of controversial judicial proceedings since the start of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011. In February an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-court-orders-release-of-mubaraks-former-chief-of-staff.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak's former chief of staff.

Also in January former culture minister Farouq Hosni was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/egypt-ex-culture-minister-acquitted-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted of charges</a> [JURIST report] of corruption and illegal enrichment.

Writing for a five judge plurality, Judge Alan Lourie stated  that adding "generic computer functions to facilitate performance" does not meet the requirement that there be "significantly more" than merely an underlying abstract idea.

Prosecutors allege that Yusuf helped to <a href="http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/05/12/jamaat-leader-yusuf-arrested">train 96 Islamic party activists</a> [bdnews24 report] for the paramilitary group known as the "Razakars." The militia group reportedly collaborated with the Pakistani junta during the 1971 war to suppress Hindu dissent. The prosecution claims to have uncovered evidence establishing that Yusuf lead the Razakars in killing approximately 700 people. In addition, reports suggest that Yusuf directed military forces to loot and burn more than 300 homes and 400 stores, and to forcibly convert approximately 200 Hindus. Prosecutors filed charges against Yusuf in April in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Crimes-Tribunal-Bangladesh-ICTB/153315501365003?sk=wall">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [Facebook page] alleging a variety of charges including murder, rape, arson and theft. The judge presiding over the case ordered that Yusuf be detained until a trial date can be set.

<p>The ICTB has been controversial since it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bangladesh-establishes-tribunal-for.php">established</a> [JURIST report] by Bangladeshi officials in 2010 to investigate and prosecute crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war. Earlier this month the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bangladesh-islamic-leader-sentenced-to-death-for-1971-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Mohammad Kamaruzzam, assistant secretary general of the JI, to death for atrocities committed during the war. Also in May the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bangladesh-war-crimes-court-indicts-uk-muslim-leadet.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, a Bangladesh-born UK Muslim leader, for crimes against humanity and genocide including his alleged role in the murder of top intellectuals during the war. In February the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-jamaat-e-islami-leader-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] JI party leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sayedee">Delwar Hossain Sayeedee</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier in February the Bangladesh parliament approved amendments to the country's war crimes laws to allow prosecutors to appeal sentences given to defendants convicted of war crimes. These amendments were a <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangladesh-to-amend-war-crimes-penalty-laws-in-response-to-protests.php">response to protests</a> [JURIST report] that ensued after Abdul Quader Mollah, another JI leader, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bangledesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-islamist-party-leader-to-life.php">given a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for crimes during the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In July 2012 the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/pdf/PRpost2015.pdf">established a 26-member panel</a> [press release] to draft plans for a replacement global development agenda. The panel's report is reportedly <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/new-global-development-agenda-must-have-human-rights-its-core-2013-05-10">due</a> [AI report] to UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [UN profile] by the end of May. The NGOs are pressing for a framework that empowers people "as human rights-holders" to hold governments, businesses, international institutions and other development actors accountable for their actions beyond borders. The report lays out nine post-2015 development priorities, including stronger protection of fundamental economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, and improved transparency in decision-making "at all levels." The report elaborates:<blockquote>A sustainable development framework founded in human rights can serve as an instrument for people and countries to help unseat the structural obstacles to sustainable, inclusive and just development, and stimulate implementation and enforcement of all human rights--civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, the right to development and to environmental protection...At a time of great uncertainty, multiple crises and increasing insecurity and conflict, let us not found the 21st century sustainable development framework on 'bracketed rights' and broken promises, but instead on a bold reaffirmation of human rights for all.</blockquote>According to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], the MDGs have not been effective in addressing inequality, and new directives must be anchored in an understanding of the "interdependence of socio-economic deprivation and democratic failures" in light of popular uprisings around the world. 

<p>The 192 nations that comprise the UN membership adopted the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf">Millennium Declaration</a> [text, PDF] in 2000, creating eight goals to be met by 2015. The goals concentrate on reducing poverty, increasing access to healthcare and education, and improving the environment. The MDGs have been criticized in the past. In June 2010 AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-stronger-un-millennium-goals-to-meet-rights-standards.php">urged world leaders to strengthen the MDGs</a> [JURIST report] to meet international human rights standards. In its criticism, AI called for gender equality in educational settings, improved maternal health, and increased government accountability for failures to address violence against women, forced marriages and reproductive rights. AI asserted that the MDGs were "grossly inadequate" with respect to the provision of aid in light of the fact that the world's slum population is projected to increase to 1.4 billion by 2020. In April 2008 UN Office on Drugs and Crime Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/un-anti-corruption-head-says-rule-of.php">contended</a> [JURIST report] that the rule of law would be a necessary prerequisite to achieving all eight of the UN's MDGs, citing a "clear correlation between weak rule of law and weak socio-economic performance."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a letter dated May 2, Kamau <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/kenyan-official-seeks-ally-un-drop-criminal-charges-172857717.html">specifically requested</a> [CSM report] that the US, China, Russia and India use their influence among the 15-member Security Council to have the charges thrown out. Under the ICC's current structure, the Security Council may <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22472242">defer a case</a> [BCC report] for up to 12 months, but does not have the power to order a dismissal. Kenyatta and his deputy president Ruto are facing ICC charges of crimes against humanity for their alleged involvement in violence following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">2007 election</a> [JURIST news archive] where <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/kenya-attorney-general-calls-for-probe.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] led to more than a thousand deaths in ethnic clashes following the election.

<p>In April Kenyatta was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">sworn in</a> as the country's fourth president following an <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-pm-raila-odinga-appeals-election-results.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports] in March by Kenyan <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/201322216228573605.html">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [Al Jazeera profile] attempting to invalidate the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">election results</a> [JURIST report]. Later in March Kenya's <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/portal/the-supreme-court.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the results were valid. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision Kenyatta's lawyer asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-presidential-candidate-asks-icc-to-withdraw-charges.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him for lack of evidence, but the prosecution refused. Kenyatta's request was based on the ICC's withdrawal of charges against co-defendant Francis Muthaura for lack of evidence. Kenyatta's lawyers claimed the evidence against Muthaura and Kenyatta was the same, but the prosecution disagreed. Kenyatta's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/icc-approves-delay-of-trial-for-kenya-presidential-candidate.php#">previously postponed</a> [JURIST report], and it will begin on July 9. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Monsanto</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-monsanto-seed-patent-dispute.php">report</a>] that a farmer who buys patented seeds may not reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission. <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Monsanto">news archive</a>] holds a <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US5352605?hl=en">patent</a> [text] on genetically-modified seeds that utilize <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/weedmanagement/pages/roundup-ready-system.aspx">Roundup Ready</a> [product website] technology. The seeds are altered to "self replicate," which means that when one plants the seeds, additional seeds will be produced. Monsanto sued a number of farmers who were using the self-replicating technology in harvests after the season they purchased the seeds, arguing the farmers should have to purchase new seeds every year. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the court sided with Monsanto: "Under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, the authorized sale of a patented article gives the purchaser, or any subsequent owner, a right to use or resell that article. Such a sale, however, does not allow the purchaser to make new copies of the patented invention." The court noted that their holding was limited to the case before them, "rather than every one involving a self-replicating product."

<p>Monday's ruling upholds a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals court <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Monsanto_Co_v_Bowman_657_F3d_1341_100_USPQ2d_1224_Fed_Cir_2011_Co">ruled for Monsanto</a> [opinion] in 2011, stating that patent exhaustion had not occurred because "once a grower, like Bowman, plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready technology and the next generation of seed develops, the grower has created a newly infringing article." </p>]]></content:encoded>

BankChampaign, NA</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-voter-citizenship-requirements.php">report</a>] on the meaning of the term <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/defalcation">"defalcation"</a> [definition] in the bankruptcy code. Under section 523(a)(4) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523">Bankruptcy Code</a> [text], an individual cannot obtain a bankruptcy discharge from a debt "for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny." Writing for the unanimous court, Justice Stephen Breyer held that the term, "includes a culpable state of mind requirement akin to that which accompanies application of the other terms in the same statutory phrase. We describe that state of mind as one involving knowledge of, or gross recklessness in respect to, the improper nature of the relevant fiduciary behavior."

<p>In this case, Randy Curtis Bullock was the trustee of his father's trust. He breached his fiduciary duty and received a judgment against him. Judgments are normally dischargeable in a bankruptcy, and Bullock attempted to file Chapter 7 to liquidate his debt. However, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found such a debt was <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Bullock_v_BankChampaign_NA_In_re_Bullock_670_F3d_1160_11th_Cir_20">not dischargeable</a> [opinion] since it was created by a trustee acting improperly, although in this case they found he had acted negligently, not maliciously. The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the Eleventh Circuit's decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pelkey</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-raisins-takings-case.php">report</a>] that section 14501(c)(1) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/14501">Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act</a> (FAAAA) [text] does not preempt state-law claims stemming from the storage and disposal of a towed vehicle. Section 14501(c)(1) reads: "a State ... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier ... with respect to the transportation of property." In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court held:<blockquote>that state-law claims stemming from the storage and disposal of a car, once towing has ended, are not sufficiently connected to a motor carrier's service with respect to the transportation of property to warrant preemption under &#167;14501(c)(1). The New Hampshire law in point regulates no towing services, no carriage of property. Instead, it trains on custodians of stored vehicles seeking to sell them. Congress did not displace the State's regulation of that activity by any federal prescription.</blockquote>The court affirmed the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Pelkey_v_Dans_City_Used_Cars_Inc_163_NH_483_44_A3d_480_2012_Court">decision</a> [text] of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.

<p>Dan's City Used Cars towed Robert Pelkey's car while he was in the hospital for two months and eventually traded the car away without compensating Pelkey. Pelkey brought suit under New Hampshire law. The district court granted summary judgment for Dan's City, finding that Pelkey's claims were preempted by federal law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After analyzing the third draft constitution, HRW expressed concern that the language recognizes universal human rights regarding only "cultural specificities of the Tunisia people." HRW fears that affirmatively naming Islam as the religion of the state and stating that the text was drafted under "the fundamentals of Islam" will damage the equality of non-believers. While the constitution claims that religious freedom should be allowed, HRW says the text fails to establish "broader concepts of freedom of thought and of conscience" that may help to protect those citizens who abide by other religions. HRW also claims that the non-discriminatory language is weak and unconvincing, and states that the legislature is given too much power to restrict freedoms of expression, association, and assembly. To assuage these concerns, HRW recommends that a new draft contain clearer affirmations to the rights of freedom of religion and conscience, and should construct a clause incorporating the international treaties signed by Tunisia into the country's human rights laws. Also, HRW says that the new draft should state that the references to Islam should not be interpreted to promote discrimination against non-believers. 

<p>Tunisia has faced political turmoil since former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in 2011. In March Tunisian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/tunisia-lawmakers-vote-on-timetable-for-constitution-and-elections.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] on a timetable to establish that the <a href="/sidebar/2012/01/tupaz-martinez-tunisia.php">draft constitution</a> [JURIST op-ed] was to be completed by the end of April and elections are to be held by December. A UN Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in January called on the government of Tunisia to adopt stronger constitutional measures to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-calls-on-tunisia-to-ensure-womans-rights-in-new-constitution.php">combat gender inequality and discrimination</a> [JURIST report], while accelerating the participation of women in all aspects of society. In October HRW called on Tunisian authorities to investigate a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-human-rights-watch-advocacy-2.php">series of attacks</a> [JURIST report] by religious extremists and to bring those responsible to justice. In October 2011 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-rights-chief-stresses-rule-of-law-as-tunisia-conducts-first-free-elections.php#">emphasized the importance of adherence to the rule of law</a> [JURIST report] as Tunisia moves forward with its new government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The residents of Beit Safafa were not consulted during during the planning of this six-lane highway, known as the "Begin Highway," and previous petitions to stop the construction have been rejected by the courts. Another hearing of the petition has been scheduled before the High Court on June 26. If the highway is permitted, Falk warns, it will cause "irreparable damage to the community, cutting off local roads and blocking access to kindergartens, schools, health clinics, offices, and places of worship," and will "[endanger] the livelihoods of some 9,300 people."

<p>Tensions remain high between Israel and Palestine.

As the law currently stands, possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor that can lead to a six-month prison sentence, a fine of up to $500, or both. Any subsequent offense can result in a two-year sentence and a fine of up to $2,000. Under the new bill, persons over 21 would receive civil fines similar to those given for traffic violations. Subsequent violations would track a tiered system of increasing fines, but no criminal record would attach to the possessor. Similarly, a person under 21 caught with an ounce or less would be subject to the same penalties as provided by Vermont law concerning underage possession of alcohol. According to the <a href="http://www.mpp.org">Marijuana Policy Project</a> (MMP) [advocacy website], the bill will now advance to Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov">Governor Peter Shumlin</a> [official website], who is expected to finalize the bill with his signature. If approved, the law will take effect on July 1, making Vermont the seventeenth US state to decriminalize marijuana. According to media sources, Vermont <a href="http://billsorrell.com">Attorney General William Sorrell</a> [official website] and Vermont's Public Safety Commission testified before the state legislature in favor of the bill. In addition, 63 percent of Vermont voters approved the proposal in local elections in 2012. 

<p>The sale and use of marijuana remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. Earlier this month the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled that the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional</a>m[JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month Washington and Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives. Similarly, medical marijuana was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts</a> [Harvard Crimson report] for the first time, as over 60 percent of voters approved a similar referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/181/s21.html">law</a> [text] had been interpreted to hold that only a person's gender at birth could be considered for the purposes of marriage, which is restricted to a man and woman. The 37-year-old woman, known to the media only as "W," reportedly <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1236633/transsexual-woman-wins-appeal-marriage-case-top-court">unsuccessfully sought to overturn the law</a> [<em>South China Morning Post</em> report] in court twice after having a government subsidized gender reassignment surgery five years ago. W reportedly argued that the government's refusal to allow her to marry effectively barred her from marrying anyone, in violation of the constitution. Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li agreed, holding that barring transgender people from marrying in their acquired gender would require the government to characterize transgender people as "pseudo" men or women. The court reportedly held that the law unduly burdened an individual's right to marry, thus contravening a fundamental constitutional right. The lone dissenting judge argued that the decision upends centuries of tradition and that the populace should have been consulted. According to media sources, the ruling will not take effect for another year in order to give the legislature the option to amend the law. However, if the government chooses not to amend the law in accordance with the high court's order, the ruling will be deemed unconstitutional.

<p>Rights of LGBT individuals remain a contentious issue throughout the world. In March Canada's House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/canada-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-transgender-discrimination.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] outlawing discrimination against transgender individuals. The bill amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and hate propaganda section of the Criminal code to include "gender identity" and "gender expression" as an improper basis for discrimination and hate speech. In July Alaska Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/alaska-to-allow-transgender-individuals-to-change-gender-marker-on-drivers-licenses.php">issued a regulation</a> [JURIST report] that allows transgender individuals to change the sex indicator on their driver's licenses without undergoing surgery. In April 2012 the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/eeoc-rules-transgender-workers-covered-under-title-vii.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Title VII employment discrimination protections extend to transgender individuals. In March 2012 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-hormone-therapy-for-transgender-inmates.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Fields v. Smith</span>, allowing a lower court decision that transgender hormone therapy is a medically necessary procedure to stand. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges, originally <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-charged-with-murder.php">filed in January</a> [JURIST report], allege that Tymoshenko and former prime minister <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=lazarenko">Pavlo Lazarenko</a> [JURIST news archive] ordered the murder of Yevhen Shcherban and two others in 1996. Shcherban, a Ukrainian parliamentary lawmaker who also headed Ukraine's Aton financial corporation, was shot dead with his wife at Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine in November 1996.

Head of operations for the Near and Middle East Robert Mardini said that in spite of repeated calls for all parties to the conflict in Syria to respect the rules of war, humanitarian response is still being hampered by security constraints and undermined by excessive bureaucratic and military controls. The ICRC <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/05/13/ICRC-says-laws-of-war-ignored-in-Syria/UPI-16421368462249/">estimates</a> [UPI report] that during the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] 4 million people have been displaced and more than 1.2 million have fled to other countries. Citing a lack of political solutions and an ever-widening gap between the needs of Syrians and the humanitarian response on the ground, the ICRC is appealing to its donors for 62.3 million Swiss francs (USD $65.2 million) in additional funding to step up its response until the end of the year for vulnerable people suffering the effects of the conflict and its neighboring countries.

<p>The Syrian Civil War has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile], and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In response to a series of massacres carried out against civilians earlier this week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called upon the international community</a> [JURIST report] to find a solution to the conflict in Syria and ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are held accountable. Last month Assad issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/syria-president-reduces-prison-sentences-of-rebel-fighters.php">reducing prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for a number of rebel prisoners, but the move was dismissed as a "meaningless gesture" by activists. Also in April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused the Syrian Air Force of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in opposition-controlled areas. In March HRW accused Syria's military of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using widely-banned cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against civilians. In February the UN said that both the Syrian government and the anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years</a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/">House of Representatives</a> last week and will now go to <a href="http://mn.gov/governor/#">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official websites] to be signed into law. Dayton has been a supporter of the legislation and has pledged to sign it during a ceremony at 5 PM EST on Tuesday. Once the bill is signed into law, Minnesota will be the twelfth US state to legalize same-sex marriage and the first Midwestern state to do so through legislative action. <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] through a court ruling in 2009.

<p>Earlier in May, both <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Delaware</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports] approved same-sex marriage legislation.

Article 8 protects an individual's right to respect for private life, which was interpreted by the court in the 2011 case <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/webservices/content/pdf/001-102940?TID=nakkzzkgpr">Haas v. Switzerland</a> [judgment, PDF] to include an individual's right to decide the way in which and at which point his or her life should end, so long as he was in a position to form his own judgment and act accordingly. In the present case of <span class="casename">Gross v. Switzerland</span>, applicant Alda Gross, an elderly Swiss woman, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/eu-court-finds-swiss-assisted-suicide-laws-vague-19174241#.UZJFUrWsh8E">petitioned the ECHR</a> [AP report] after she could not find a doctor to prescribe her a lethal dosage because she suffered from no clinical illnesses. She had argued she was entitled to end her life rather than become increasingly frail. The <a href="http://www.bger.ch/">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in German] has previously ruled that a doctor could issue a lethal dosage to a patient after taking certain steps, but no distinction was ever made as to whether those guidelines applied strictly to those suffering from a terminal illness. Because of this absence of clear guidelines, the court limited itself to ruling that Gross's right to respect for her private life was violated without taking a stance on the substantive content of Switzerland's assisted suicide guidelines.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world. The only European countries that allow assisted suicide are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Last month, the Supreme Court of Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-high-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-has-no-right-to-assisted-suicide.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a paralyzed woman seeking to allow her partner to help her commit suicide. Although Ireland decriminalized suicide in 1993, it is still a crime to assist another to commit suicide. In December a report released by the French government <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/france-report-recommends-permitting-doctors-to-accelerate-death-for-terminally-ill.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that the country permit doctors to "accelerate death" for terminally ill patients seeking doctor-assisted euthanasia. In August the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/uk-high-court-rules-against-paralyzed-man-in-right-to-die-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the plea of a paralyzed man challenging the legitimacy of the Suicide Act 1961 and other laws barring his ability to commit suicide. In 2011 an Indian high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] passive euthanasia was permitted under certain circumstances. In 2010 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that removing a patient from life support would not be a criminal offense if the patient had previously given consent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, an unidentified company selling nutritional supplements and its founder, claimed when their names were entered on Google's German-language website, autocomplete suggested links to Scientology and fraud which resulted in injury to the plaintiffs' reputations. The court held that although operators of search engines are not regularly required to verify content generated by algorithms is free of possible breaches, once operators become aware of unlawful violations of personal rights, they are responsible for removing content.

<p>This defamation suit is the latest of the legal battles of Google and its subsidiaries. Last week, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] sent a Statement of Objections informing Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Google, of its preliminary view that the company was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/european-commission-investigating-motorola-for-abuse-of-injunctions-against-apple.php">abusing its injunctions</a> [JURIST report] against Apple. Last month, Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/google-to-modify-search-displays-in-europe-in-response-to-antitrust-concerns.php">agreed to provide clearer labeling</a> [JURIST report] of promoted links in order to assuage the European Commission's antitrust concerns that the search engine was abusing its dominance in the market by favoring its own products. Also last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-dismisses-viacom-copyright-suit-against-youtube.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a copyright infringement lawsuit by Viacom against YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, for clips that were posted on the website without authorization. Also in April, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, and Italy <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">initiated a joint legal action</a> [JURIST report] against Google over its privacy policy, claiming that Google failed to inform customers about how much information the company has about them and how long the information is kept.</p>]]></content:encoded>

For the first three years after its passage, the legislation will model Oregon's <a href="http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/index.aspx">Death with Dignity Act</a> [official materials] by <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/vermont-house-passes-aid-dying-bill-19172787#.UZK5bI6nUzQ">including safeguards</a> [AP report] which require, among other things, that the patient be competent and assert on three separate occasions the desire to receive a lethal dose of medication.

But I also know how important it is for those who face terminal illness and tremendous pain to have this choice, in conjunction with their physicians and loved ones, in the final days of their lives.</blockquote>If the bill is signed, Vermont will become the fourth state permitting physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to certain terminally ill patients.

<p>In November 2008 Washington voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/washington-supports-lethal.php">approved a ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] allowing competent, terminally ill adults to obtain lethal prescriptions. Washington's measure was also modeled after Oregon's Death with Dignity Act, enacted in 1997 and <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court in 2006.

In their April order, a panel of federal judges refused to vacate or modify their 2010 <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/Order-population-reduction.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] for reduction of the California inmate population. This order mandated the state to reduce its prison population to within 137.5 percent of institutional design capacity. California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/about">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] and the additional parties to the appeal state that the April injunction will require the state to reduce its prison population by approximately 9,000 inmates in less than eight months. Further, the appeal states that prison health care in California now "exceeds constitutional standards."

<p>California has been under scrutiny for its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">prison overcrowding</a> [JURIST news archive] since 2006, when the state's governor proclaimed a <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=4278">prison overcrowding state of emergency</a> [text]. In May 2011, the Supreme Court decided <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/USSC-Plata-opinion09-1233.pdf">Brown v. Plata</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the federal three-judge panel's order that California reduce its state prison population. The court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] because it prevented the system from providing adequate medical and mental health care to inmates. In January Brown issued a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/3JP-docs-01-07-13/Terminating-Prison-Overcrowding-Emergency-Proclamation-10-4-06.pdf">proclamation</a> [text, PDF], which will effectively terminate the 2006 state of emergency. In this proclamation, the governor indicated that the circumstances giving rise to the prison overcrowding state of emergency no longer exist within California prisons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The child, M.C., was born with "ambiguous genitals," possessing both testicular and ovarian tissue. When M.C. was 16 months old, and in the custody of the SCDSS after his biological parents were deemed unfit and relinquished their parental rights, the SCDSS elected to perform sex assignment surgery to make M.C. a girl. M.C., who is now 8 years old and identifies as a boy, was adopted by Pamela and John Mark Crawford in 2004. The SPLC filed lawsuits on behalf of the Crawfords in both <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/Crawford_State_Complaint_Filed.pdf">state</a> and <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/Crawford_Fed_Complaint_Filed.pdf">federal court</a> [complaints, PDF], alleging that the SCDSS violated M.C.'s due process rights by subjecting him to a painful and medically unnecessary procedure. According to the federal lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website]:<blockquote>In choosing to perform the surgery and potential sterilization without requesting, initiating, or inquiring as to a pre-deprivation hearing, Defendants Aaronson, Amrhein, and Appiagyei-Dankah acted under color of state law and unreasonably violated Plaintiff's procedural due process rights to bodily integrity, privacy, procreation, and liberty, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>The couple seeks a declaratory judgment and compensatory damages. The lawsuit is the first of its kind in the US.

<p>One defendant, Dr. Ian Aaronson, had earlier addressed the risks of such surgeries in a medical journal, writing that it would be "catastrophic" if the infant eventually identified as a boy. All of the defendant doctors knew that they could not predict whether M.C.'s gender identity would develop as a boy or girl, and no medical standard exists to determine the gender of children born with intersex condition. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The examination is in response to authorities from the Union of Comoros, who <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/Referral-from-Comoros.pdf">requested</a> [referral, PDF] that ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda initiate an investigation into the alleged crimes which arose from the raid, pursuant to Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. The referral states that Comoros has an interest in the matter because the majority of the crimes took place on board a vessel registered to the nation and within its territorial jurisdiction. The referral claims that two issues require attention, including "the nexus between the attack on the flotilla and the Palestinian/Israeli conflict" and "the unlawfulness of the blockade of Gaza." Bensouda said that the preliminary examination will determine whether the criteria for opening an investigation are met.

<p>In November, a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/turkish-court-opens-trial-against-israeli-commanders-over-2010-raid.php">opened a trial <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] for former Israeli military commanders accused of killing nine Turkish citizens during the 2010 raid. The Turkish judge began the proceedings with testimony from people who were on board the flotilla, as well as from relatives of the deceased. Prosecutors have demanded life in prison for the Israeli commanders involved in the May 2010 raid to enforce a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The case illustrates tension between Turkey and Israel, which have previously maintained close diplomatic ties. Israel has criticized the trial of the four Israeli commanders, dismissing the proceedings as politically motivated. Hundreds of protestors showed up outside the courthouse to voice their opposition to the actions of these commanders. Turkey has demanded an end to the Gaza blockade, a formal apology and compensation for the victims and their family.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Montt was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/guatemala-ex-dictator-found-guilty-of-genocide.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] on Friday of the genocide, torture and rape of 1,771 Ixil Mayans during his 1982-83 rule for ordering the country's military to commit the acts. The court <a href="http://voicerussia.com/2013_05_14/Guatemala-ex-dictator-faints-in-court-hospitalized/">also ordered</a> [AFP report] that the government declare March 23 to be National Day Against Genocide because that is the date on which Montt took power in 1982. Montt was absent from the hearing, which was held to address reparations for the victims, because he fainted due to high blood pressure earlier that day. His transfer from a military facility to a hospital had been approved over the weekend, but Montt had opted to wait until after Monday's hearing to be transferred. Doctors said his health condition was exacerbated when he was not allowed to take his medications to jail with him after his conviction on Friday. He is <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2013/05/14/303358/guat-must-apologize-to-maya-for-genocide/">expected to appeal</a> [PressTV report] the verdict and his sentence of 80 years in prison.

<p>The time period during Montt's rule was one of the bloodiest parts of the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/latin_america/jan-june11/timeline_03-07.html">Guatemala Civil War</a> [PBS timeline; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guatemala+civil+war">news archives</a>], in which more than 200,000 people were killed over 36 years. Montt's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/new-judge-to-preside-over-trial-of-guatemala-ex-dictator.php">delayed last month</a> [JURIST report] when an annulment was ordered by the Constitutional Court and the case was transferred to another judge to determine whether defense evidence had been incorporated properly. This ruling came days after the original judge on the case had <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guatemala-judge-reverses-suspension-of-trial-against-former-president.php">ignored a prior ruling</a> [JURIST report] annulling the case and began the trial anyway. The UN in March had <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">commended Guatemala</a> [JURIST report] for beginning his long-awaited trial, as it marked the first time ever that a former head of state was tried for genocide by a national tribunal. The former dictator was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in January for genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since the nation's pro-democracy protests in Manama that began in February 2011, activists have used the social media site to report perceived violations. The court <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/560914">found</a> [BNA report] the tweets to be an overuse of the freedom of expression, and a contradiction to the fundamental norms of society.

In February a Bahrain police officer was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/bahrain-police-officer-sentenced-to-7-years-for-killing-protester.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for fatally shooting a protester.

The Treasury Inspector General's <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/201310053fr-revised-redacted-1.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] suggests that poor management led to "insufficient oversight" in the review of hundreds of advocacy groups.

The law, adopted in November, requires NGOs and NCOs to register as "organizations performing the functions of foreign agents" if they want to engage in any sort of political activity and receive foreign funding. Under this registration, the government can closely monitor them and impose severe penalties. Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful assembly and of association Maina Kiai noted that according to international human rights law, this close monitoring by the government lacks any appropriate legal basis. Moreover, human rights defenders could be considered to engage in "political activity," and the law could infringe on their ability to advocate and raise human rights issues. Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders Margaret Sekaggya stressed:<blockquote>We already warned against the extensive requirements contained in this law for NCOs allegedly "engaging in political activities," which could infringe on the right of human rights defenders to publically raise human rights issues and conduct advocacy work. Defenders should be able to participate in public affairs by raising issues of public interest in a critical way, irrespective of where their funding comes from. This type of work should not been seen as a political activity but as an essential component of an open and democratic society.</blockquote>The Special Rapporteurs urged Russia to amend the law to comply with international law standards, ending the adverse effects on hundreds of organizations and human rights defenders.

<p>The Russian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">approved the law</a> [JURIST report] last July, with many critics arguing that <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] is taking steps backwards toward a more restrictive government.  Putin signed the bill into law a week later amongst opponents' claims its purpose is to curb free speech. The government has <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/russia-enforces-ngo-foreign-agents-law.php">enforced the law</a> [JURIST report] despite criticism, raiding the Moscow headquarters of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW), <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy websites] in March.  Last month, HRW and AI released reports criticizing the limiting of free speech since Putin's return to the presidency. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44907&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.UZQvySv729Y">urged</a> [press release] Syrian rebels to stop the "truly atrocious" acts. Although the video cannot be fully authenticated, it appears to show a Syrian rebel leader cutting out and biting the heart of a dead soldier. As Pillay stressed, "mutilating or desecrating corpses during a conflict is a war crime." Opposition fighters have also been accused of acts of torture, summary executions and extra-judicial killings.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been going on since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile], and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Last month Assad issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/syria-president-reduces-prison-sentences-of-rebel-fighters.php">reducing prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for a number of rebel prisoners, but the move was dismissed as a "meaningless gesture" by activists. Also in April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused the Syrian Air Force of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in opposition-controlled areas. In March HRW accused Syria's military of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using widely-banned cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against civilians. In February the UN said that both the Syrian government and the anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years</a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000. In January more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The total number of refugees in the past year reached 4,000&#8212;increasing the total Eritrean refugee population to more than 50,000. Specifically, she expressed concern for the increasing numbers of both unaccompanied minors and those seeking religious freedom. She attributed these recent increases to a "culture of rights denial." Echoing the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43831&Cr=Eritrea&Cr1=#.UZTsuoKt7pg">UN statements made in December</a> [UN News Centre report], she urged that, "Real change would require a fundamental reform process transforming the current culture of rights denial with one anchored in the rule of law, respect for and realization of all human rights and human dignity." Keetharuth reiterated that such changes will be necessary before the refugees can return to their homeland. 

<p>The international community has become increasingly concerned with forced labor issues and human rights abuses that have led to the increase of refugees leaving <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Eritrea">Eritrea</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] alleged that the Eritrean government's national service program requires all able-bodied men and women serve indefinitely as conscripts for the government, and it assigns some of these conscripts to state-owned construction companies as <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-eritrea-mine-investors-risk-complicity-in-human-rights-violations.php">forced laborers</a> [JURIST report]. In June UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eritrea-failing-to-address-human-rights-violations-un-rights-chief.php">condemned Eritrea</a> [JURIST report] for its failure to address the human rights violations in the country. These sentiments came on the heels of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2009/index.htm">Trafficking in Persons Report 2009</a> [text], which added Eritrea and five other countries to its list of countries with the worst human trafficking records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the providers at <a href="http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com/">Red River Women's Clinic</a> [clinic website] sought such recognition, pre-existing hospital policies prevented them from complying with the statute. Without such recognition, the clinic could be shut down. As that facility is the only abortion clinic in the state, this statute could effectively ban abortion there. Lead counsel for the CRR, Autumn Katz, remarked, "No politician or hospital administrator has the authority to decide if women in North Dakota can exercise their constitutionally protected right to an abortion... We are confident that the courts will agree and ultimately strike down this harmful and unnecessary requirement." While the statute does not ban abortion, the CRR argues that it restricts access to reproductive rights and is thus effectively unconstitutional. 

<p>North Dakota has been at the recent forefront of the ongoing debate on <a href="/feature/2012/04/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Wednesday's lawsuit supplements a previous challenge against a <a href="http://votesmart.org/static/billtext/33425.pdf">2011 North Dakota law</a> [HB 1297, PDF] restricting drug-induced abortions, which a state judge recently said he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-judge-to-strike-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">strike down</a> [JURIST report]. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/governor-jack-dalrymple">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] signed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Dalrymple also signed two other bills into law, <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0351-01000.pdf?20130516003227">HB 1305</a> and <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0304-02000.pdf?20130516003209">HB 1456</a> [text, PDF], along with SB 2305. The CRR is also planning challenges to those provisions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision follows legislation in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/argentina-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Argentina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uruguay-congress-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage.php">Uruguay</a>, which both legalized same-sex marriage in recent years. The ruling, entered on May 14 and effective May 16, <a href="http://www.cnj.jus.br/noticias/cnj/24686-resolucao-que-disciplina-a-atuacao-dos-cartorios-no-casamento-gay-entra-em-vigor-amanha">prohibits authorities</a> [press release, in Portuguese] from refusing to perform same-sex marriages, register same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, or convert same-sex civil unions into marriages at the couple's request. There is an opoprtunity for a judicial appeal to Brazil's highest court, the <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Supreme Federal Tribunal</a> [official website, in Portuguese].

<p>This ruling makes Brazil the fifteenth country to legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The issue continues to be controversial both in the US and internationally. Earlier in May, same-sex marriage legislation was approved in the US states of <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Minnesota</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Delaware</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports]. Last month France's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/france-parliament-gives-final-approval-to-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved a bill</a> to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples. All that remains is for the bill to be cleared by the nation's Constitutional Council and signed into law by President Francois Hollande. Also in April Ireland announced it would hold a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-to-hold-same-sex-Marriage-referendum.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] on same-sex marriage. In March, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the second of two cases the court heard that week on same-sex marriage. In that argument, the court considered the validity of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law that recognizes only opposite-sex marriages for federal benefits purposes, despite state law on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution also welcomes the 2012 establishment of the <a href="http://www.etilaf.org/">National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces</a> (ETILAF) [official website] as the representatives needed for a political dialogue and eventual transition. The measure also requests urgent financial support for countries hosting Syrian refugees, with the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] registering more than a million displaced persons now living in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile], and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In response to a series of massacres carried out against civilians earlier this week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called upon the international community</a> [JURIST report] to find a solution to the conflict in Syria and ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are held accountable. Last month Assad issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/syria-president-reduces-prison-sentences-of-rebel-fighters.php">reducing prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for a number of rebel prisoners, but the move was dismissed as a "meaningless gesture" by activists. Also in April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused the Syrian Air Force of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in opposition-controlled areas. In March HRW accused Syria's military of <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using widely-banned cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against civilians. In February the UN said that both the Syrian government and the anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years</a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rather than processing purchases in a chronological order, as is the common practice, the bank processed its customers' purchases from largest to smallest. The penalty was originally ordered in August 2010, but the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/12/26/10-16959.pdf">tossed</a> [text, PDF] the order in December. The case's original judge, Judge William Alsup, reviewed the case and reinstated the penalty after concluding once again that the bank misled its customers about the posting order of charges, and then proceeded to charge the customers for overdraft fees. Wells Fargo plans to appeal the decision. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wells+fargo">Wells Fargo</a> [JURIST news archive] has been involved in many legal battles recently. The US government filed a lawsuit against the bank in October, alleging that Wells Fargo <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/wells-fargo-challenges-lawsuit-by-us-government.php">deliberately concealed</a> [JURIST report] the nature of mortgages that were insured by the federal government, ultimately costing the government hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims. In August the company was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sec-orders-wells-fargo-to-pay-65-million-for-improperly-selling-risky-mortgages.php">assessed a $6.5 million fine</a> [JURIST report] by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly selling high-risk mortgage securities to investors during the housing market crash in 200. In July the Ninth Circuit dismissed a lawsuit against several banks, including Wells Fargo, that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-atm-fee-price-fixing-suit.php">accused the banks of price-fixing</a> [JURIST report]. In March the SEC <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/SEC-files-subpoena-enforcement-action-against-Wells-Fargo.php">filed a subpoena enforcement action</a>[JURIST report] against Wells Fargo to force the company to hand over documents connected to the company's sale of nearly $60 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities to investors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last Friday, a Guatemalan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/guatemala-ex-dictator-found-guilty-of-genocide.php">sentenced Rios Montt to 80 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in presiding over the brutal junta responsible for the torture, rape and murder of 1,771 indigenous Ixil Mayans between 1982 and 1983. The trial marked the first time that a national court prosecuted a former head of state for genocide and crimes against humanity. UN experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/FR/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13330&LangID=E">advised the government</a> [press release] that it must continue to foster an ideology of normative justice in order to ensure the non-recurrence of the "heinous crimes" that characterized the nation's civil war. According to the UN, Friday's court decision marks a "profoundly significant milestone" in the fight against impunity, and human rights violations including enforced disappearances, arbitrary executions, rape and forced displacement. In addition, the UN praised the judgment as an example for nations around the world struggling to address victims' rights after periods of mass atrocities, and as a reflection of the principle that "marginalized people" must have the same access to justice "as the most powerful." 

<p>The UN has shown continuous support for Guatemala's efforts to try Rios Mont. In March UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">lauded</a> [JURIST report] Guatemala for beginning the trial of Rios Montt and former intelligence chief Jose Rodriguez Sanchez, both of whom stand accused of committing genocide and crimes against humanity. In April Judge Patricia Flores, who recused herself from the case in 2011, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-former-guatemala-leader-accused-of-genocide-halted.php">halted the trial</a> [JURIST report] and attempted to invalidate a year-and-a-half of court proceedings once she was reinstated last month. However, Barrios <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guatemala-judge-reverses-suspension-of-trial-against-former-president.php">continued the trial</a> [JURIST report] against Rios Montt despite the prior ruling annulling the case. Montt was ordered to stand trial multiple times for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity, and the trial started on March 19. In January a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Rios Montt to stand trial. Last May Flores <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">issued a second order</a> [JURIST report] demanding Rios Montt stand trial after ruling that a sufficient amount of evidence had been mounted against him, necessitating his testimony before a court of law. Rios Montt was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Named plaintiffs included the <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html">English Premier League</a>, the <a href="http://fft.fr">French Tennis Federation</a>, the <a href="http://www.nmpa.org/home/index.asp">National Music Publishers' Association</a> [corporate websites] and several other music publishers. The plaintiffs asserted that YouTube <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/15/us-google-copyright-idUSBRE94E19Z20130515">infringed on copyrighted materials</a> [Reuters report] by allowing unauthorized hosting of certain protected video and sound clips. Unnamed class members included copyright owners who issued "take-down notices" to Youtube after its unauthorized hosting, and any music publisher whose copyrighted materials were posted on the site without permission. District Judge Louis stanton held Wednesday that the nature of the specific claims would require each class member to demonstrate a high degree of individualized factual evidence regarding their specific injury, thus complicating the requirement of representative typicality found in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23">Rule 23</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a> [text]. According to media sources, the plaintiffs are considering appealing the decision, as denial of class action certification is immediately appealable as a matter of course.

<p>The plaintiffs filed suit for copyright infringement against Google in 2007 concurrently with  <a href="http://www.viacom.com/Pages/default.aspx">Viacom</a> [corporate website], which owns Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. Viacom sought $1 billion in damages as well as an injunction against YouTube for clips that were posted on the website without authorization. However, in April the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-dismisses-viacom-copyright-suit-against-youtube.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Viacom's suit. The court held that YouTube was protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (DMCA) "safe harbor" provisions, which shelter service providers from the infringing activities of their customers by shifting liability to individual infringing customers. Viacom previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/viacom-files-1b-copyright-infringement.php">brought a similar suit</a> [JURIST report] against YouTube in 2007, but was unsuccessful. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Romeike family alleged that Germany's ban against homeschooling caused them a well-founded fear of persecution based on their membership in a "particular social group"&#8212;homeschoolers. In the opinion, Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote that US immigration <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1158">law</a> [text] for asylum-seekers only applies for those who have a "well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." Because the Romeike family was not persecuted in particular, nor was any homeschooling family persecuted more severely than other families breaking the law, their applications for asylum were denied. For example, families that allowed their children to skip school are punished in the same way. Because the law is applied equally to everyone, the court found that the neutral law could is not compatible with persecution. Moreover, the court found that faith-based homeschoolers are not a cognizable social group.

<p>In January 2010 an immigration judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-judge-grants-asylum-to-german.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the Romeikes asylum, ruling that <a href="http://www.hslda.org/legal/cases/romeike.asp">German laws against homeschooling</a> [HSLDA backgrounder] gave the family a well-founded fear of persecution. In the opinion, Judge Lawrence Burman described homeschoolers as a distinct group of people who have a "principled opposition to government policy" that would face persecution both because of their religious beliefs and because they were "members of a particular social group." The Romeike family <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1968099,00.html">fled Germany</a> [TIME report] in 2008. Burman's opinion was critical of German policy regarding educational freedom, calling the country's laws against homeschooling a violation of basic human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US District Judge Susan Webber Wright denied the motion to dismiss, ruling that the lawsuit made a strong enough case to warrant allowing it to go forward. The court also found that the abortion providers bringing the suit have standing. The case, challenging <a href="http://www.arkansashouse.org/public/php/pdf_viewer.php?pdf=ftp://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/2013/Public/SB134.pdf">Act 301</a> [text, PDF] amending Arkansas law governing abortions, was brought by the <a href="http://www.aclualabama.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas</a> and the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy websites] on behalf of two Little Rock abortion providers. Known as the Human Heartbeat Protection Act, Act 301 redefines "viability" as "a medical condition that begins with a detectible heartbeat." Currently, Arkansas law <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-20/subtitle-2/chapter-16/subchapter-7/20-16-702/">defines</a> [text] a "viable fetus" as "a fetus which can live outside of the womb." The court found that there are sufficient facts alleged to state a claim that Act 301 impermissibly infringes a woman's Fourteenth Amendment right to chose to terminate a pregnancy before viability.

<p>In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's veto of the Human Heartbeat Protection Act. In February the Arkansas Senate also <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">voted to override a veto</a> [JURIST report]. Numerous states have changed their abortion laws recently to impose more restrictions on the availability of abortions, leading to several legal challenges. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation, which would have gone into effect in January. Montana voters in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure on the minor. Also that month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Arkansas and Georgia's laws, bans abortions after 20 weeks. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to HRW, the new constitution and laws are negatively affecting human rights and the rule of law. The 29-page report states that many of the major changes "weaken legal checks on its authority, interfere with media freedom, and otherwise undermine human rights protection in the country." HRW noted the Hungarian government's continuing failure to comply with EU recommendations, suggesting concrete EU action, such as suspending Hungary's voting rights. Of particular concern were legal changes that have curbed the independence of the judiciary and the administration of justice, impacted media freedom, stripped religious groups of their status as churches and discriminated against LGTB people and women.

<p>Hungary has been <a href="/forum/2013/04/gabor-halmai-hungary-churches.php">criticized recently</a> [JURIST op-ed] for changes to its constitution. Just last month an EU Commissioner spoke out against Hungary's failure to reinstate judges and prosecutors who had been forced into early retirement. More changes to the Hungarian constitution have included <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-experts-criticize-hungary-law-criminalizing-homelessness.php">restrictions on the homeless</a> [JURIST report], increased control of the media and a strict, narrow definition of family. The new laws were controversial <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-controversial-constitutional-amendments.php">even when they were passed</a> [JURIST report], and have been subject to ongoing scrutiny. In February Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hungary-constitutional-court-strikes-down-church-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that outlines how churches are given official designation, finding that it was too political. In January the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hungary-top-court-declares-new-electoral-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down an electoral law</a> [JURIST report] requiring voters to register to vote at least two weeks before elections in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Djibrine was in charge of the Directorate of Documentation and Service (DDS) political police under then-president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18927845">Hissene Habre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hissene">news archive</a>], and was <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/9/71564/World/International/Chad-arrests-top-war-crimes-suspect.aspx">arrested</a> [AFP report] after DDS victims filed a lawsuit accusing him of torture, acts of barbarism and illegal detention. He could be extradited to Senegal, as mandated by the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] to try Habre in 2006, though Senegal has delayed Habre's prosecution for years. Until now, African leaders accused of such gross crimes have been tried only in international courts, and Habre's trial could set a historic precedent.

<p>Earlier this month Senegal and Chad <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/senegal-chad-sign-agreement-allowing-probe-of-former-chad-dictator.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] allowing Senegalese judges to carry out investigations in Chad in preparation for the prosecution of Habre. Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre, who has been been under house arrest there since 2005. In March lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium. In July 2011 Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision to deport Habre</a> [JURIST report] back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned of possible torture. That month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay Habre's deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death in absentia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bolivia's lower house <a href="http://en.mercopress.com/2013/05/17/bolivian-congress-confirms-president-morales-can-run-for-re-re-election">approved the bill 84 to 33</a> [MercoPress report] despite the single re-election provision in the Bolivian <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Bolivia/bolivia09.html">Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] after the measure was approved in the Senate. The constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after Morales's first term in office began in 2005. In 2008, Morales <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/bolivia-president-offers-concession-to.php">engineered an endorsement</a> [JURIST report] of the constitution by agreeing not to seek reelection in 2014. However, in April, Bolivia's Constitutional Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/bolivia-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the two consecutive term limit does not apply retroactively, meaning next year's election would legally count as Morales's first re-election. Elections are scheduled for December 2014, but Morales has made no comments regarding his plans to run for a third term. If Morales chooses to run and succeeds, he will become Bolivia's <a href="http://en.mercopress.com/2013/05/17/bolivian-congress-confirms-president-morales-can-run-for-re-re-election">longest-serving president</a> [MercoPress report], serving continuously from 2006 to 2020.

<p>Morales is the first indigenous president to be elected in Bolivia and the <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/bolivia-president-promises-justice-for.php">theme of his presidency</a> [JURIST report] has been advancing the interest of the majority indigenous community. On June 8, 2010, the Bolivian National Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bolivia-congress-advances-indigenous-rights-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would create an independent justice system for indigenous communities. In March 2009, Morales began <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/bolivia-president-begins-redistributing.php">redistributing land</a> [JURIST report] to indigenous farmers under power given to him by the country's new constitution. Bolivia's new constitution went into effect in February 2009, placing more power in the hands of the country's majority. It also created seats in Congress for minority indigenous groups. In August 2008, Morales won a referendum to continue his presidency, which he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">personally proposed</a> in a bid to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">legitimize his campaign</a> [JURIST reports] for the constitutional changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW visited the area in April and discovered detention cells, interrogation rooms and torture devices consistent with descriptions given by former detainees since the beginning of the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011. In addition HRW reportedly uncovered documents listing the security force members who had worked in the facilities alongside catalogues of all of Raqqa's college graduates. Interviews with former detainees suggest that security forces questioned civilians about "lawful activities," including participation in peaceful demonstrations, providing relief to displaced families, and providing assistance to the injured. HRW reports that it has uncovered 27 such facilities across Syria, evidencing a systematic pattern and state policy of "ill-treatment and torture" thus constituting a crime against humanity. According to HRW, local opposition leaders must work to protect this evidence, which will likely be "vital to future domestic and international accountability processes," despite continued attack by Syrian government forces and struggles to provide basic services to the local population.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] erupted in 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile]. The increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In May the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called upon the international community</a> [JURIST report] to find a solution to the conflict in Syria and ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are held accountable. Last month Assad issued a decree <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/syria-president-reduces-prison-sentences-of-rebel-fighters.php">reducing prison terms</a> [JURIST report] for a number of rebel prisoners, but the move was dismissed as a "meaningless gesture" by activists. Also in April HRW accused the Syrian Air Force of <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in opposition-controlled areas. In March HRW accused Syria's military of <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">using widely-banned cluster munitions</a> [JURIST report] against civilians. In February the UN said that both the Syrian government and the anti-government rebels are <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-both-sides-to-syria-conflict-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years</a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000. In January more than 50 countries asked the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/un-security-council-urged-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria to the ICC</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

US District Judge Susan Webber Wright <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/arkansas-abortion-injunction_n_3293731.html">granted a motion for preliminary injunction</a> [AP report] against the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF; <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=SB134">materials</a>], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." The law is being <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/arkansas-abortion-law-challenged.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.aclualabama.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas</a> and the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy websites] on behalf of two Little Rock abortion providers. Earlier this week Webber ruled that the lawsuit could <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-to-proceed.php">proceed</a> [JURIST report], rejecting a motion to dismiss. Friday's ruling means that the law, which was set to take effect August 1, cannot be enforced while the lawsuit is pending.

<p>In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's veto of the Human Heartbeat Protection Act. In February the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">voted to override a veto</a> [JURIST report] of a 20-week abortion ban. Numerous states have changed their abortion laws recently to impose more restrictions on the availability of abortions, leading to several legal challenges. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation, which would have gone into effect in January. Montana voters in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure on the minor. Also that month the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Arkansas and Georgia's laws, bans abortions after 20 weeks. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The sheriffs argue in their complaint that the laws violate their second amendment right to keep and bear arms, relying on the US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF]. The complaint argues: <blockquote>Under Heller, the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right of individual citizens to keep and bear commonly used firearms for all lawful purposes. The individual right to employ commonly-used firearms for selfdefense is "the central component" of the Second Amendment guarantee."</blockquote> The sheriffs asked the court to declare the two laws unconstitutional and to issue a permanent injunction barring enforcement of the laws. The state has 30 days to answer the complaint. 

<p>This is the latest development in the controversial topic of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] in the US. The challenged laws were <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March following the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323297104578179271453737596.html">shooting</a> [WSJ backgrounder] at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">Maryland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST reports] approved new gun control laws. In March, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to pass three bills which would require background checks for all private gun sales, renew a grant to improve schools security programs and make the act of buying a weapon for someone barred from owning one a federal crime. Also in March, US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/03/eric-holder-urges-congress-to-confront-gun-control.php">spoke before Congress</a> [JURIST report] urging passage of gun control measures, including universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines and military style assault weapons. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Parliament also voted on Friday to reject  the <a href="http://www.bloco.org/">Left Bloc</a> and <a href="http://www.osverdes.pt/">Green Party's</a> [official websites, Portuguese] proposal to grant gay couples the same adoption rights as heterosexuals. The bill approved by Parliament is intended to primarily serve the children in the event that their biological parent dies or falls ill. It was passed by only five votes, while 9 Parliament members declined a vote and 28 did not appear.  The bill must still be signed into law by President Anibal Cavaco Silva, who in 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/portugal-president-ratifies-same-sex-marriage-law.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] but has expressed disapproval of same-sex adoption. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+adoption">Adoption rights of same-sex couples</a> [JURIST news archive] have created controversy in several courts worldwide. In February, Puerto Rico's Supreme Court upheld a law banning same-sex couples from adopting children. Earlier that week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a woman in a same-sex relationship could <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/europe-rights-court-rules-austrian-woman-can-adopt-child-of-same-sex-partner.php">adopt her partner's biological child</a> [JURIST report]. Also in February, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that same-sex couples in a civil union <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">can legally adopt</a> [JURIST report] the non-biological children of their partners. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court </a>[official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/northern-ireland-high-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in October that a law permitting adoption only by heterosexual married couples or single individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, is unlawful. Also in October, the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/civil.cfm">Alabama Court of Civil Appeals</a> [official website] upheld a law limiting marriage as a union between and one man and one woman. That ruling effectively <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alabama-court-rules-woman-cannot-adopt-same-sex-partners-child.php">barred a woman from adopting her female partner's child</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill indicates that marijuana may only be used for specified medical conditions, and is intended to be regulated through dosage limits and background checks. The state would license 22 growers and 60 dispensers across the state to provide the drug. Those who qualify will be prohibited from smoking marijuana in public or around minors. This bill has already been approved the the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/">Illinois House</a> [official website]. The bill will now proceed to the governor, who has not indicated [Chicago Tribune report] whether he will sign the legislation. 

<p>The sale and use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. Earlier this month, the Vermont State Legislature approved a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/vermont-legislature-votes-to-decriminalize-small-amounts-of-marijuana.php">replaces criminal penalties with civil fines</a> [JURIST report] for possession of up to an ounce of marijuana and up to five grams of hashish. Also this month, the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled that the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] and <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives. Similarly, medical marijuana was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts</a> [Harvard Crimson report] for the first time, as over 60 percent of voters approved a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">similar referendum </a>[Petition 11-11, PDF]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was brought by two incarcerated defendants seeking retroactive relief from racially discriminatory, 10-year mandatory minimum sentences imposed on them in 2005. The ruling expands the FSA, which lessens penalties for possession and dealing, to people whose cases was concluded before the law was passed, potentially opening the door for thousands of inmates to request reduced prison time from federal judges. In the opinion, Judge Gilbert Merritt wrote: <blockquote>[T]he law can and should be interpreted to replace the old, discriminatory mandatory minimums. Perpetuation of such racially discriminatory sentences by federal courts is unconstitutional and therefore the sentencing guidelines must be interpreted to eliminate such a result.</blockquote>The court also found that the intentional maintenance of discriminatory sentences constitutes a denial of equal protection.  

<p>Friday's ruling expands upon a June 2012 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-5683i7k8.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-expands-application-of-fair-sentencing-act.php">expand the FSA</a> [JURIST report] by applying the FSA to defendants who were sentenced after the act was in place, even if they were arrested before the act took effect. In <span class="casename">Dorsey</span>, Justice Stephen Breyer concluded: "[T]he FSA did not include any language to make it apply retroactively, but it not did explicitly deny such retroactivity either." In April 2008, a study released by the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] reported that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">had their sentences reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. In 2007, the USSC <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that reduced crack cocaine penalties. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The defendants, who identify as women, were <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/17/cameroon-drop-charges-against-2-transgender-youth">arrested</a> [press release] in July 2011 and prosecuted on charges of homosexual conduct. Police who saw them dressed in women's clothing and stopped their vehicle, claiming the people in the car were groping each other. At trial no eyewitnesses were produced to confirm the charge, but the trial court convicted both defendants. The appellate court, however, overturned the conviction, reasoning that the trial court had improperly relied on confessions made under duress and lacked necessary witness testimony. The letter follows <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-urge-cameroon-to-decriminalize-same-sex-acts.php">earlier requests</a> [JURIST report] from rights groups to decriminalize the same-sex laws in accordance with recommendations issued by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website], which expressed concern that the laws impede the effectiveness of HIV and AIDS prevention programs.

<p>Rights of LGBT individuals remain a contentious issue throughout the world. Last week, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hong-kong-high-court-rules-transgender-woman-can-marry.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a law prohibiting a transgender woman from marrying her boyfriend was invalid under the Chinese constitution. In March Canada's House of Commons <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/canada-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-transgender-discrimination.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] outlawing discrimination against transgender individuals. The bill amended the Canadian Human Rights Act and hate propaganda section of the Criminal code to include "gender identity" and "gender expression" as an improper basis for discrimination and hate speech. In July Alaska Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/alaska-to-allow-transgender-individuals-to-change-gender-marker-on-drivers-licenses.php">issued a regulation</a> [JURIST report] that allows transgender individuals to change the sex indicator on their driver's licenses without undergoing surgery.

The law criminalizes child marriages and forced marriages and states that rape victims should not be charged with adultery or fornication. <a href="http://www.fawziakoofi.org/">Fawzia Koofi</a> [official website], a lawmaker who has stated an interest in being a future presidential candidate, expressed disappointment regarding the legislation's failure, and specifically stated concerns because some women legislators voted against it. The legislation will be sent to a committee for review and may receive another vote by parliament later this year.

<p>Women's rights in Afghanistan has been a hotly debated topic since the end of the Taliban's reign in 2001.

In July that year, the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-expert-condemns-recent-killing-of-women-in-pakistan-afghanistan.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to end violence against women and to initiate investigations into the killings of two women. In March 2012, the HRW called on the Afghan government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw-1.php">release women and girls imprisoned</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan for "moral crimes," many of which involve flight from unlawful forced marriage or domestic violence and "zina," which is sex outside of marriage due to rape or forced prostitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Litvinenko's death has led to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/russia-sponsored-litvinenko-poisoning.php">strained relations</a> [JURIST report] between the UK and Russia, due in part to Russia's refusal to extradite <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lugovoi+OR+lugovoy">Andrei Lugovoy</a> [JURIST news archive], the man suspected of administering the radioactive poison <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/isotopes/polonium/index.asp">polonium-210</a> [CDC backgrounder], which killed Litvinenko, so that Lugovoy could stand trial for murder in the UK.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-3.htm">Lawson v. FMR LLC</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-3-LawsonPetition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider whether an employee of a privately-held contractor or
subcontractor of a public company is protected from retaliation by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1514A">Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 1514A]. Section 1514A forbids a publicly traded company, a mutual fund or "any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company [to] ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of" certain protected activity. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13679670161776916145&q=LAWSON+v.+FMR+LLC,+670+F.3d+61+&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that under section 1514A such contractors and subcontractors, if privately-held, may retaliate against their own employees, and are prohibited only from retaliating against employees of the public companies with which they work.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-462.htm">Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-462-2012-10-11-Delta-Cert-Petition-FINAL.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide on the scope of preemption under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/41713">Airline Deregulation Act of 1978</a> (ADA) [49 USC &#167; 41713(b)]. Section 41713(b) provides that states "may not enact or enforce a law, regulation or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier." Respondent Ginsberg participated in Northwest Airlines' frequent flyer program and sued when he was removed from the program. Although the district court dismissed Ginsberg's implied covenant of good faith claim as preempted by the ADA, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2344503047263045600&q=Ginsberg+v.+Northwest,+Inc.&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">reversed</a> [opinion] as to the implied covenant claim, finding such claims categorically unrelated to a price, route or service.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-696.htm">Town of Greece v. Galloway</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Galloway-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider, "whether the court of appeals erred in holding that a legislative prayer practice violates the Establishment Clause notwithstanding the absence of discrimination in the selection of prayer-givers or forbidden exploitation of the prayer opportunity." In its 1983 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3932615455276115963&q=marsh+v.+chambers&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Marsh v. Chambers</a> [opinion] the Supreme Court upheld the practice of starting a legislative session with a prayer unless the selection of prayer-givers "stem[s] from an impermissible motive" or "the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief." In this case, the town of Greece, New York, allowed volunteer private citizens to open town board meetings with a prayer. This US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13574198750186036788&q=galloway+v.+town+of+greece&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">struck down</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/second-circuit-rules-against-town-council-led-prayer.php">report</a>] the practice, applying the "endorsement" test from <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6993086659963510613&q=lemon+v+kurtzman&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a> [opinion].</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1128.htm">Medtronic, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Final_Filed_Writ_wAppendices.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether, in a declaratory judgment action brought by a patent licensee, the licensee has the burden to prove that its products do not infringe the patent, or whether the patentee must prove infringement. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14388218096121279792&q=MedImmune,+Inc.+v.+Genentech,+Inc.,&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/supreme-court-rules-in-immigration.php">report</a>] that a patent licensee that believes that its products do not infringe the patent and accordingly are not subject to royalty payments is "not required &#8230; to break or terminate its &#8230; license agreement before seeking a declaratory judgment in federal court that the underlying patent is &#8230; not infringed." In this case the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1209713945471780432&q=Medtronic+Inc.+v.+Boston+Scientific+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that, "in the limited circumstance when an infringement counterclaim by a patentee is foreclosed by the continued existence of a license, a licensee seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement and of no consequent liability under the license bears the burden of persuasion."</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-7822.htm">Fernandez v. California</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Fernandez-Pet-12-7822.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide "whether a defendant must be personally present and objecting when police officers ask a co-tenant for consent to conduct a warrantless search or whether a defendant's previously stated objection, while physically present, to a warrantless search is a continuing assertion of Fourth Amendment rights which cannot be overridden by a co-tenant." The Court of Appeals of California <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8926647036229045680&q=People+v.+Fernandez,+208+Cal.App.4th+100&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">concluded</a> [opinion] that Supreme Court precedent established in 2006 in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15354777432474595853&q=georgia+v+randolph&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Georgia v.

According to HRW, the government of Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] has failed to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes, has cracked down on media and human rights activists, and has continued to abuse suspected <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder] supporters, despite Rajapaska's promise to UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile]. Since 2009, government officials have reportedly  threatened members of the media, civil society and the political opposition, and publications have been subject to government censorship, or, in some cases, shut down. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams said:<blockquote>The Rajapaksa government seems to be hoping that broad-based repression will dampen the exercise of fundamental freedoms. But Sri Lankan activists and journalists who showed incredible resilience during wartime to bring forth the truth, will undoubtedly find a way to do so when the country is at peace.</blockquote>HRW urged governments to press for an independent international investigation into wartime abuses, speak out against ongoing abuses and provide support for Sri Lankan civil society.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009. In March the UN Human Rights Council passed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-body-adopts-resolution-on-sri-lanka.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. In February Sri Lankan authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-sri-lanka-security-forces-using-rape-to-extract-confessions.php">accused of using rape</a> [JURIST report] as a method of interrogating members or supporters of the LTTE. Earlier that same month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">criticized</a> Sri Lanka for failing to investigate war crimes, and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-pushes-un-for-independent-investigation-of-sri-lanka-rights-abuses.php">pushed</a> [JURIST reports] for an independent investigation of rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the human rights consultation in Brussels the EU confirmed its intention to continue to monitor the implications of Russia's recent "Foreign Agents" law and urged Russia to refrain from adopting legislation on "homosexual propaganda," which the EU believes could "increase discrimination and violence against LBGTI individuals." The EU also urged Russia to ensure that defense lawyers are able to work freely, noting that activists arrested at a demonstration against President Putin's inauguration last year are still awaiting trial. The next EU-Russia human rights commission is scheduled for fall 2013 in Moscow, where the EU believes the commission will benefit from the presence of relevant Russian ministries and agencies. 

<p>Human rights groups have criticized Russia's recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">foreign agents law</a> [JURIST report] since its adoption last November. The law requires non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and <a href="/dateline/2013/05/shubin-nikita-russian-law.php">non-commercial organizations</a> (NCOs) [JURIST op-ed] to register as foreign agents if they engage in any political activity or receive foreign funding. Last week the UN condemned the law's "obstructive, intimidating and stigmatizing effects" on the country's NGOs and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-experts-urge-russia-to-revise-law-detrimental-to-ngos.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Russia to revise the law to comply with international standards. Critics have argued that <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] is taking steps backwards toward a more restrictive government, claiming the law is curbing free speech and allows the government to severely penalize the works of NGOs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Habibur Rehman ordered Musharraf to pay two bonds each worth one million rupees (approximately USD $10,163). Musharraf has been held at his Islamabad farmhouse since April 19. The ATC is a special court established in April for hearing a case regarding Musharraf's illegal confinement of 62 judges after declaring a state of emergency in 2007 Pakistan. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Pakistan Supreme Court</a> [official website] adjourned hearing the treason case against Musharraf to May 22.

<p>This is the latest development in the series of charges and legal troubles for Musharraf. In April the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf from running for public office for the rest of his life, as well as extending his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. Last week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">ordered seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Qatada's lawyers insist that he should be able to spend time with his family before he leaves the UK for Jordan, where he will stand trial for terrorism. Qatada was convicted <em>in absentia</em> for organizing and encouraging terrorist attacks in Jordan in 1999 and 2000. Justice Stephen Irwin of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/special-immigration-appeals-commission">Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> (SIAC) [official website] in London ruled that Qatada must remain in custody until he can be deported to Jordan.

<p>Qatada has been held in the UK for more than a decade when he was arrested in 2002 under the anti-terrorism act. Last month the UK Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uk-appeals-court-denies-governments-abu-qatada-appeal.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an appeal from an earlier decision not deport Qatada until a fair trial treaty has been ratified, fearing Qatada will be tortured upon his return to Jordan.

In February 2009 the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the UK to pay Qatada 2,500 in damages, determining that he was illegally detained in violation of the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In this case, Dr. Melissa Cloer filed an untimely claim to recover from the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html">National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program</a> [official website] and incurred more than $100,000 in attorney's fees.

The ruling affirmed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14937718272381036205&q=Cloer+v.+Secretary+of+Health+%26+Human+Servs&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">decision</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

<p>Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia joined in the opinion except as to Part II-B. In Part II-B, Sotomayor asserted that, "[t]he Government's position is also inconsistent with the goals of the fees provision itself."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lancaster</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that respondent Burt Lancaster is not entitled to federal <em>habeas</em> relief. Lancaster was convicted of murder in a Michigan state court. At the time the crime was committed, the Michigan appeals court recognized "diminished capacity" as a defense negating the <em>mens rea</em> element of first-degree murder, but by the time he was tried and convicted, the Michigan Supreme Court had rejected this defense. Lancaster sought federal <em>habeas</em> relief for a violation of due process. In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court rejected his claim:<blockquote>This Court has never found a due process violation in circumstances remotely resembling Lancaster's case&#8212;i.e., where a state supreme court, squarely addressing a particular issue for the first time, rejected a consistent line of lower court decisions based on the supreme court's reasonable interpretation of the language of a controlling statute. Fairminded jurists could conclude that a state supreme court decision of that order is not "unexpected and indefensible by reference to [existing] law." ... Lancaster therefore is not entitled to federal habeas relief on his due process claim.</blockquote>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2144993565341322402&q=LANCASTER+v.+METRISH&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">judgment</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit was reversed.

<p>At <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-final-arguments-of-term.php">oral argument</a> [JURIST report] in April the Michigan solicitor general (SG) argued that under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12425981498832779110&q=Harrington+v.+Richter&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Harrington v. Richter</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-rules-on-effective-assistance-of-counsel-standard.php">report</a>], "a federal court may only overturn a State court conviction that is such an erroneous misapplication of this court's clearly established precedent as to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement. That is, an extreme malfunction." In this case, the SG suggested, the state judge simple exercised fair-minded discretion to apply the statute retroactively. The attorney for Lancaster argued that his client had been treated in a fundamentally unfair manner: that his re-trial was not held quickly enough, that the Michigan Supreme Court abolished diminished capacity based on a statute that does not clearly abolish it, and that the Michigan Supreme Court retroactively applied the abolition to Lancaster. Justice Antonin Scalia questioned if Lancaster had been allowed to bring the defense in a timely fashion, if the Supreme Court wouldn't have just struck it then, and if anyone had ever mitigated their charges in Michigan based on diminished capacity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Commissioner</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a UK "windfall tax" is creditable under US tax law. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/901">Internal Revenue Code &#167;901(b)(1)</a> [text] states that any "income, war profits, and excess profits taxes" paid overseas are creditable against US income taxes. In 1997, the UK imposed a one-time "windfall tax" on 32 UK companies privatized between 1984 and 1996. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court held that the UK tax is creditable under &#167;901:<blockquote>The economic substance of the UK windfall tax is that of a US income tax. The tax is based on net income, and the fact that the Labour government chose to characterize it as a tax on the difference between two values is not dispositive under Treasury Regulation &#167;1.901-2. Therefore, the tax is creditable under &#167;901.</blockquote>The court reversed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15183358603281699314&q=PPL+Corp.+%26+Subsidiaries+v.+Commissioner&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&as_ylo=2011&as_yhi=2011">decision</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion.

<p>In this case, PPL Corporation was attempting to qualify for a foreign tax credit for paying a "windfall tax" in the UK, where they own a 25 percent stake in a utilities company. PPL's attorney, Paul Clement, <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-privileges-and-immunities-and-foreign-taxes.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] for a traditional, formalistic approach to evaluate the windfall tax, which he argued imposed double taxation on PPL as the windfall tax was evaluated as a tax on "value" rather than a tax on profits, although it determined value solely by surveying profits. The US Solicitor General argued against this understanding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

FCC</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that courts must apply the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14437597860792759765&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Chevron</a> [opinion] framework to an agency's interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency's jurisdiction. The provision at issue, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/332">47 USC &#167; 332(c)(7)</a> [text] of the Federal Communications Act (FCA), states that "nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government." However, &#167; 332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires states or local authorities to act within a "reasonable" period of time. The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website], under its general jurisdiction to administer the FCA, defined a "reasonable" period of time to be 90 days for some types of applications and 150 days for others. Failure of the state or local governments to act within the defined time periods allows affected individuals to bring an action in court or petition the FCC. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia concluded:<blockquote>Where Congress has established a clear line, the agency cannot go beyond it; and where Congress has established an ambiguous line, the agency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow. But in rigorously applying the latter rule, a court need not pause to puzzle over whether the interpretive question presented is "jurisdictional." If "the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute," that is the end of the matter.</blockquote>The ruling affirmed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=792497964880994209&q=City+of+Arlington,+Texas+v.+FCC&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&as_vis=1">judgment</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito joined. Roberts argued that, "[a] court should not defer to an agencyuntil the court decides, on its own, that the agency is entitled to deference."</p>]]></content:encoded>

This bill makes Vermont the fourth state in the US to approve the practice. The Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act (aka "Death with Dignity" bill), was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/vermont-house-approves-physician-assisted-suicide-for-terminally-ill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the legislature earlier this month. Under the new law, mentally competent patients who have been diagnosed with six months to live will be permitted to request that the doctor proscribe a lethal dose of narcotic. The doctor will be required to follow specific procedures relating to obtaining patient consent. The law creates a 48-hour waiting period before the doctor may write the prescription. The provisions take effect in July and will expire after three years.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world. The only European countries that allow assisted suicide are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/europe-rights-court-rules-switzerland-laws-on-assisted-suicide-too-vague.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Swiss law does not provide sufficient guidelines on the extent of the right to die. Last month the Supreme Court of Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-high-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-has-no-right-to-assisted-suicide.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a paralyzed woman seeking to allow her partner to help her commit suicide. Although Ireland decriminalized suicide in 1993, it is still a crime to assist another to commit suicide. In December a report released by the French government <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/france-report-recommends-permitting-doctors-to-accelerate-death-for-terminally-ill.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that the country permit doctors to "accelerate death" for terminally ill patients seeking doctor-assisted euthanasia. In August the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/uk-high-court-rules-against-paralyzed-man-in-right-to-die-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the plea of a paralyzed man challenging the legitimacy of the Suicide Act 1961 and other laws barring his ability to commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This call comes in response to the Afghanistan parliament, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/afghanistan-parliament-blocks-womens-rights-legislation.php">blocked legislation</a> [JURIST report] on Saturday that would have protected provisions of the 2009 <a href="http://www.saarcgenderinfobase.org/includes/showFile.php?id=85">Law on Elimination of Violence Against Women</a> (EVAW) [text, PDF] from being repealed by future Afghanistan presidents. EVAW criminalizes child marriage, forced marriage, selling and buying women for the purpose or under the pretext of marriage, ba'ad (giving away a woman or girl to settle a dispute), forced self-immolation and several other acts of violence against women. In its December report on the implementation of EVAW, <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Qy9mDiEa5Rw%3d&tabid=12254&language=en-US">Still a Long Way to Go</a> [text, PDF], UNAMA urged all levels of Afghanistan's government to publicly emphasize that the promotion and protection of women's rights is an integral part and main priority of peace and reconciliation throughout Afghanistan, and a central pillar of the country's political, economic, and security strategies.

<p>Women's rights in Afghanistan has been a hotly debated topic since the end of the Taliban's reign in 2001. Last February <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hrw-to-afghanistan-prosecute-sexual-abusers-not-victims.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Afghanistan to take steps to ensure that its laws protect victims of sexual abuse and do not result in their prosecution. In December UNAMA <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that women in Afghanistan still faced abuse at the hands of man despite progress in implementing EVAW. In July the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-expert-condemns-recent-killing-of-women-in-pakistan-afghanistan.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to end violence against women and to initiate investigations into the killings of two women. In March 2012 the HRW called on the Afghan government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw-1.php">release women and girls imprisoned</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan for "moral crimes," many of which involve flight from unlawful forced marriage or domestic violence and "zina," which is sex outside of marriage due to rape or forced prostitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kivalina, a village of Inupiat Eskimo natives, <a href="http://www.pawalaw.com/assets/docs/kivalina-vs-exxon-08-1138-sba.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint PDF] against 22 corporations in 2009 for damages caused by greenhouse gases that reduced sea ice, increasing flooding, and sought damages so that it could relocate to a safer area. By refusing to hear the case, the Supreme Court has effectively affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/Ninth-Circuit-dismisses-Alaska-village-claim-over-greenhouse-emissions.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report]  of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Citing to the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-29.php">American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</a> (AEP) [JURIST report], the Ninth Circuit ruled that greenhouse emissions were a political question, the resolution of which belongs to a different branch of government. By letting the Ninth Circuit's ruling stand, the court is essentially affirming its decision in AEP, requiring future greenhouse gas issues to be handled through the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website], not the judiciary. 

<p>The role of the EPA in controlling greenhouse gas emissions is <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EPA">still evolving</a> [JURIST news archive]. In <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">Massachusetts v. EPA</a> [JURIST report] the court found that the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, and its failure to set applicable standards without reason was not in accordance with law.  However, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-epa-in-cross-state-pollution-case.php">EPA lost several cases</a> [JURIST report] when it issued regulations limiting emissions that cross state lines. A DC Circuit decision upholding the EPA's plan to add <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-epa-plan-to-add-more-ethanol-to-gasoline.php">more ethanol to gasoline</a> [JURIST report] marked a rare victory for the EPA last August. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month Rios Montt was found guilty of the genocide, torture and rape of 1,771 indigenous Ixil Mayans during his 1982-83 rule. The ex-dictator was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/guatemala-ex-dictator-found-guilty-of-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by a three-judge panel headed by Judge Jasmine Barrios to 80 years in prison. The constitutional court annulled the previous ruling and everything that happened at trial since April 19 when Rios Montt was without a defense lawyer after the defense team walked out of the court house in protest of "illegal proceedings." Rios Montt refused to use the public defender. 

<p>Rios Montt's trial marks the first time a head of state has been prosecuted for genocide in a national court and the UN has <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-chief-lauds-guatemala-for-beginning-trial-of-former-president.php">lauded </a> [JURIST report] Guatemala's efforts. Last month, Judge Flores, after being reinstated, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/trial-for-former-guatemala-leader-accused-of-genocide-halted.php">attempted to invalidate</a> [JURIST report] a year-and-a-half of court proceedings while she was recused from the case. However, Barrios, who issued the verdict, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/guatemala-judge-reverses-suspension-of-trial-against-former-president.php">continued the trial</a> [JURIST report] despite the prior ruling annulling the case. Rios Montt was previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">protected</a> [JURIST report] from prosecution until last January because he was serving as a member of congress, an immunity that had been lifted due to his departure from the legislature. Rios Montt's trial began on March 19 after a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-stand-trial-for-genocide.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] him to stand trial last January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Bolivian <a href="http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Bolivia/bolivia09.html">Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish] only allows a president to serve two terms. However, last month the Bolivian Constitutional Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/bolivia-court-rules-president-can-seek-third-term.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the two consecutive term limit should not be applied retroactively, and because the country's constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] after Morales began his term, his first term will not count. The controversial bill was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/bolivia-lawmakers-approve-presidents-third-term.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by Bolivian lawmakers earlier this month and will allow Morales to seek a third term in the elections next year. If Morales runs and wins, he will be Bolivia's longest serving president. 

<p>Morales is the first indigenous president to be elected in Bolivia and has <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/bolivia-president-promises-justice-for.php">worked towards</a> [JURIST report] promoting justice for the indigenous Bolivian population. In June 2010, the Bolivian National Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bolivia-congress-advances-indigenous-rights-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would create an independent justice system for indigenous communities. In March 2009, Morales began <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/bolivia-president-begins-redistributing.php">redistributing land</a> [JURIST report] to indigenous farmers under power given to him by the country's new constitution. Bolivia's <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report] went into effect in February 2009, placing more power in the hands of the country's majority.

The decision was in response to a <a href="http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> [official website] request seeking to have more than 50 photographs released which show bin Laden's body after he was killed by US special forces in Pakistan in 2011. The decision was made in the interest of safety for the American people, and included an assertion from the Obama administration, which said that the graphic nature of the pictures had the potential to cause riots which may endanger Americans living abroad.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/judges-seem-unswayed-by-request-to-release-photos-of-bin-ladens-corpse.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the release of the photos in January. Concerns about the nature of bin Laden's death and his subsequent burial at sea have arisen since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">announcement of his death</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011, while US officials have maintained that their actions were lawful. US State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/state-department-legal-adviser-defends-legality-of-bin-laden-killing.php">defended the killing</a> [JURIST report] saying it was "consistent with the laws of armed conflict and US military doctrine." Days after the killing, human rights experts from the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-special-rapporteurs-on-executions-want-full-statement-of-facts-on-bin-laden-killing.php">called on the US to disclose further details</a> [JURIST report] of the killing, in order "to allow an assessment in terms of international human rights law standards." UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-full-disclosure-on-bin-laden-killing.php">insisted</a> [JURIST report] on "a full disclosure of the accurate facts" surrounding the killing of Bin Laden after the White House altered the official account of the killing from its original announcement. US Attorney General Eric Holder told the US Senate Judiciary Committee that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/holder-bin-laden-killing-lawful.php">killing of Bin Laden was lawful and justified</a> [JURIST report], testifying that the shooting of Bin Laden was "consistent with our values," and that the soldiers who killed him "conducted themselves totally appropriately."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/uk-government-introduces-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">introduced in January</a> [JURIST report] and will effectively extend the application of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/contents">Marriage Act of 1949</a> [materials] to same-sex as well as opposite-sex couples. The bill allows for an exception for any religious institutions that do not wish to perform same-sex weddings. Same-sex couples in England and Wales have been permitted to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21194052">enter into civil partnerships since 2005</a> [BBC report], which has allowed them to receive many of the same legal rights as married opposite-sex couples. <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website], who also serves as the Leader of the <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">Conservative Party</a> [official website], strongly supports the bill. His support has <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/uk-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage.php">created tension</a> [JURIST report] within the Conservative Party. The bill will next proceed to the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/">House of Lords</a> [official website] for final approval.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a controversial issue internationally. <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/france-president-signs-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption-bill.php">France legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage last week. Earlier this month Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/brazil-justice-council-effectively-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">effectively legalized</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage in a court ruling that prevented notaries from denying to perform ceremonies for same-sex couples. Also this month same-sex marriage legislation was approved in the US states of <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Minnesota</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">Delaware</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports]. Last month Ireland announced it would hold a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-to-hold-same-sex-Marriage-referendum.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] on same-sex marriage. In March, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two same-sex marriage cases regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST reports], with decisions expected next month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The opinion, authored by Judge Marsha Berzon, focused on balancing fetal viability and a woman's right to medical autonomy.  The state defended the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/adopted/s.2036jud.pdf">statute</a> [text, PDF] by arguing that it was not an outright ban because it permitted procedures in the event of a medical emergency. The court rejected this argument: "the state may not ... impose an undue burden on her [the mother's] choice through regulation.  Allowing a physician to decide if abortion is medically necessary is not the same as allowing a woman to decide whether to carry her own pregnancy to term." Citing a "long line of invariant" precedent, the court further held that the statute crossed the line from a permissible medical regulation to an outright ban on procedures during gestation. It was not convinced that gestation at 20 weeks produced fetuses that could be viable outside the womb. Viability is the medical threshold for state bans as determined by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&navby=case&vol=410&invol=113">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion]. Because the law does not meet this threshold, the state's interest in protecting the fetus is subject to the woman's federal right of medical autonomy.

<p>This ruling comes on the heels of several developments in controversial state abortion statutes. Last Friday a judge for the <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/default.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas</a> [official website] temporarily blocked enforcement of a law banning abortions <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-to-proceed.php">12 weeks into a pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law </a>[JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation. Montana voters in November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring notice to parents of minors before a planned abortion procedure. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new constitution limits future presidents to two five-year terms. The provision limiting presidential terms will not apply retroactively, so the 89-year-old Mugabe will be able to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/19/us-zimbabwe-referendum-idUSBRE92I0IP20130319">run in the next election</a> [Reuters report] and potentially continue to serve as president for the next decade. Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's president since the country's independence from Britain in 1980. Wednesday's actions come as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">January agreement</a> [JURIST report] between Mugabe and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6439617.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morgan+tsvangirai">news archive</a>], who both pledged their support for the new constitution. In 2008 the two political rivals <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">formed a coalition government</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">highly contested elections</a> [JURIST reports], ultimately finding a compromise to hold elections on the condition that a new constitution was enacted beforehand. Elections should take place within the year, but the date has yet to be determined. 

<p>In March in a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-voter-approve-new-constitution.php">nationwide referendum</a> [JURIST report], nearly 95 percent of voters supported the passage of the draft constitution, which then passed completely unopposed through both houses of Parliament. In February three UN independent human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Zimbabwe to respect international human rights in anticipation of the referendum and potential changes to the system of government. The UN's emphasis on the protection of individuals' right to privacy and freedom of association accompanied <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch's</a> [advocacy website] call for "credible, free and fair elections," a proposition that the advocacy group claims Zimbabwe <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to ensure</a> [JURIST report] in previous elections. Experts point to incidents such as the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/zimbabwe-charges-tsvangirai-aides-with-breaching-secrecy-laws.html">March 17 arrest</a> [Bloomberg report] of four Tsvangirai aides, working for the prime minister's political party the <a href="http://www.mdc.co.zw/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> [official website]. Held on charges of breaching state secrecy law, the arrests follow a string of allegations against political associates, including human rights lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa who is being charged with <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">obstructing or defeating the course of justice</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, entitled the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, is intended to help create a 13-year path to citizenship for the approximately 11 million current undocumented immigrants, contingent upon strengthening security along the Mexican border. The bill also proposed an improved process for allowing high-skilled immigrants into the country's workforce. After a five-day deliberation, the bill passed by a vote of 13-5. The 13 who voted in favor of the bill consisted of 3 Republicans and 10 Democrats. The full Senate will consider the bill next month.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has become a hot button issue in the US. Tuesday's bill is the result of a bipartisan group of eight senators, including Senators <a href="http://www.schumer.senate.gov/">Chuck Schumer</a>, <a href="http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/">John McCain</a>, <a href="http://www.durbin.senate.gov/public/">Dick Durbin</a>, <a href="http://www.menendez.senate.gov/">Robert Menendez</a> and <a href="http://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/">Marco Rubio</a> [official websites], who in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-senators-unveil-immigration-reform-plan.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/_files/_pdfs/Framework%20For%20Immigration%20Reform.pdf">framework</a> [text, PDF] of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The individual senators involved in building the framework released several statements on what they hoped the legislation will achieve. McCain <a href="http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=82b56b33-0e30-667d-596f-8822f3ca36d6&Region_id=&Issue_id=">focused on border security</a> [press release], stating that "greater focus needs to be paid to drug traffickers and criminals that cross the border." He also <a href="http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=82b06c86-d403-2a4f-7b86-e59912bf5489&Region_id=&Issue_id=">compared the framework to failed legislation</a> [FAQ text] that was put forward in 2007, and issued more details about the plan, including that funding for some aspects of the program will come from "fees collected from immigrant workers&#8212;both new guest workers and the previously undocumented." These funds, said McCain, were intended to be used for "registering the undocumented, processing visas and other applications, enhancing enforcement and providing English and civics education to immigrants." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report alleges the two officials helped fund and plan violence. <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Kenyatta</a> and <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Ruto</a> [ICC case materials] have already been charged with crimes against humanity in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] from their suspected involvement. In the report, the commission also details how the media's portrayal contributed to prolonging the violence. It also analyzes the historic causes of the violence, going back to the treatment by the country's first three presidents following independence. According to the TJRC, historical discrepancies in land distribution contributed to perpetuating violence.  

<p>This is the latest in the controversy surrounding Kenyatta and Ruto's involvement in the human rights violations. Despite the allegations, both were able to win the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uhuru-kenyatta-declared-winner-of-kenya-presidential-election.php">recent election</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month the Kenyan ambassador to the UN requested the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-un-ambassador-seeks-dismissal-of-icc-charges-against-president.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta and Ruto.

Parliament unanimously <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22620662">passed</a> [BBC report] the treaty in response to international pressure for Tokyo to address concerns that Japanese mothers from broken international marriages can take children away from foreign fathers, leaving the fathers without any recourse for the children's return. Countries that are party to the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text] agree that should a child be removed from a signatory country in violation of parental custody rights, the child shall be promptly returned to the treaty partner country. The convention <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/japan-approves-joining-intl-child-abduction-pact-19230834#.UZ1HVCv72K8">will likely take effect next year</a> [AP report] when Japan officially ratifies the treaty after finalizing domestic procedures, such as passing an implementation law and setting up a local authority for locating abducted children.

<p>Under Japanese family law, <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2010/01/26/community/judges-fill-the-gaps-in-japans-family-law/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%2525253A+japantimes+%25252528The+Japan+Times%2525253A+All+Stories%25252529&utm_content=Google+Feedfetcher#.UZ1hfyv72K8">only one parent is granted custody</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report], and foreign parents are usually excluded from custody privileges. According to human rights groups, nearly 160,000 divorced or separated foreign and Japanese parents in Japan are <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/10/10/news/custody-laws-force-parents-to-extremes/#.UZ1hmSv72K8">not allowed to see their children</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report] under the current child custody laws. In 2011 <a href="http://www.edano.gr.jp/index.html">Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano</a> [official website, in Japanese] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/japan-agrees-to-sign-international-child-abduction-treaty.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Japan would be signing the convention for the welfare of children. Japan was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/japan-urged-to-sign-international-child.php">urged to sign the treaty</a> [JURIST report] by 10 other nations in early 2010. Japan had resisted signing the treaty, citing opposition from women who had fled abusive husbands. The US House of Representatives increased pressure on Japan to sign the convention by passing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.3240.IH:">International Child Abduction Prevention Act of 2009</a> [text] in 2010, which created nonbinding sanctions against any country refusing to cooperate in cases of international child abductions. Russia remains the only G8 nation to not sign the treaty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law expanded the firearms banned as "assault weapons" under existing state law. It also limits magazine capacity to 10 rounds. The complaint alleges these new requirement are overly vague which makes them too difficult to follow. The lawsuit is seeking an immediate injunction of enforcement of the law. The plaintiffs allege that the new restrictions unconstitutionally hamper individuals' right to purchase firearms for personal protection and prevent retailers from selling weapons that should not be outlawed. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/connecticut-governor-to-sign-gun-control-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in April following the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/newtown-connecticut-school-shooting.htm">shooting</a> [ABC News backgrounder] at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.

<p>This is the latest development in the controversial topic of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] in the US. Earlier this week, a group of Colorado County Sheriffs <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-sheriffs-challenge-new-gun-control-laws.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] similar regulations. The Colorado laws were <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/colorado-governor-signs-gun-control-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March in response to the Connecticut shooting. Last month <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/maryland-senate-approves-gun-control-legislation.php">Maryland</a> [JURIST report] also approved new gun control laws. In March President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/obama-urges-congress-to-pass-gun-control-measures.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to pass three bills which would require background checks for all private gun sales, renew a grant to improve schools security programs and make the act of buying a weapon for someone barred from owning one a federal crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontreporters.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A bipartisan group of lawmakers from the US House of Representative advocated Wednesday for a law that would shield the press from giving information to a federal entity unless certain conditions are met. The <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/media-shield-law-house-group-91745.html">push for legislation</a> [Politico report] comes in response to an incident in which the US Department of Justice (DOJ) obtained journalists' records. In a press conference, Representative Ted Poe (R-TX) <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/301341-house-pushes-oversight-of-doj-in-wake-of-ap-leaks-case">called the DOJ's search</a> [The Hill report] for the source of leaked information in April and May 2012 "a massive intimidation fishing expedition." The new legislation would prevent the DOJ from taking such actions unless it was in the interest of preventing potential harm to national security or an act of terrorism. Similar to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.448:">Free Flow of Information Act</a> [text], the bill would give journalists some protections from penalties for refusing to identify confidential sources, allowing journalists to refuse divulging sources unless a court compels them to.

<p>The Obama administration has renewed its efforts to push for the reintroduction of media shield legislation after a recent scandal in which federal investigators <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/13/ap-phone-records-government-intrusion-unprecedented_n_3268569.html">secretly used a subpoena</a> [AP report] this year to obtain phone records of AP journalists without advance notice. The records were believed to have been in connection with a foiled bombing plot involving the Yemen branch of al Qaeda in the spring of 2012. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that he <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-14/world/39248139_1_phone-records-justice-department-holder">recused himself</a> [WP report] from investigations into the leak probe. AP called the search "massive and unprecedented" in a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/05/13/doj-seizes-ap-phone-records/2156819/">letter</a> [text] to Holder. More than 50 news organizations joined in protest against the DOJ, issuing a <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/sites/default/files/Media%20coalition%20letter%20re%20AP%20subpoena.pdf">second letter</a> [text, PDF] to Holder the following day. The US Attorney's office in Washington <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/700577/051413-letter-to-g-pruitt.pdf">responded to criticism</a> [text, PDF], stating that investigators seek phone records from news outlets as a last resort after making "every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means." AP and other news organizations are demanding that the DOJ destroy the phone records.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Musharraf has been detained since April 19 at his Islamabad farmhouse for the detention charges as well as conspiracy to murder former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Just two days ago, the ATC <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-grants-bail-for-former-military-ruler-remains-on-house-arrest.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] to Musharraf over the murder of Bhutto. Although the judge rejected Musharraf's most recent bail application, Musharraf can appeal to the high court. 

<p>Musharraf has had many legal troubles of late. In April the Peshawar High Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-bans-musharraf-from-running-for-public-office.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] him from running for public office for the rest of his life and extended his house arrest during the ongoing trial regarding the murder of Bhutto. Last week the Pakistani interim government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/interim-government-of-pakistan-refuses-to-try-musharraf.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to try Musharraf for treason because they claimed such action would be outside the scope of their duties. In April a Pakistan court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/pakistan-court-extends-bail-for-former-president.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Musharraf's bail on charges of illegally detaining judges. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-pakistan-should-hold-musharraf-accountable-for-human-rights-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to hold Musharraf accountable for alleged human rights abuses upon his return to the country. Last year Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-to-seek-arrest-of-ex-president-musharraf.php">pledged to arrest </a>[JURIST report] Musharraf for his alleged involvement in Bhutto's assassination. In August 2011 a court ordered <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pakistan-court-orders-seizure-of-musharrafs-property-assets.php">seizure of his property</a> [JURIST report] and froze his bank account after he failed to respond to multiple subpoenas regarding the assassination investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The public prosecution had charged these seven police officers with attempted and premeditated murder. The initial panel of judges on this case declined to review it, forcing the appeals court to assign a new panel of judges. The court found <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/05/22/criminal-court-acquits-seven-police-officers/">insufficient evidence</a> [Daily News Egypt report] to convict. Most Egyptian police officers with charges involving protesters' deaths have been cleared of the charges. Nonetheless, the <a href="http://www.mohp.gov.eg/default.aspx">Ministry of Health</a> [official website, in Arabic] suggests nearly 1,000 protesters were killed and 6,000 injured from excessive police force during the 18-day uprising.

<p>Egypt has experienced continued unrest and instability since the 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month a number of Egyptian opposition groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-opposition-files-lawsuit-demanding-public-debate-of-budget.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] demanding public debate of the country's budget. Earlier in April Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-upper-house-approves-new-election-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new election procedures to elect the House of Representatives. The process has been delayed, however, by Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referring</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed law to the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) for review. The court's decision was said to be based on technical grounds, namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral to the SCC for final review <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">before passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] in five key areas as demanded by the high court. in March, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Band members Alekhina, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to two years in prison for "hooliganism," characterized by the court as driven by religious hatred, in connection to the band's February 2012 "guerrilla performance" of a protest song at the altar of Moscow's <a href="http://www.xxc.ru/english/">Christ the Savior Cathedral</a> [official website], a space maintained to be sacred to the Russian Orthodox Church. In denying Alekhina parole, the court accepted the prosecutors' <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russian-court-denies-parole-to-pussy-riots-alekhina/article4743119.ece">claim</a> [AP report] that Alekhina has systematically disobeyed prison authorities and failed to repent for her crime. After being barred from the court hearing, Alekhina went on a hunger strike on Wednesday and ordered her defense not to participate. The court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-sentencing-deferral-for-imprisoned-feminist-rocker.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Alekhina a sentencing deferral, despite her having a young child.

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot sparked an international outcry against the Russian political and judicial system. Last month a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/member-of-russia-feminist-rock-group-denied-parole.php">denied parole</a> [JURIST report] for Tolokonnikova, who had requested it so that she could look after her young daughter. In February the band <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/russia-feminist-rock-group-appeals-conviction-to-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] challenging their conviction. They contend that their conviction violates four articles of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. In January a court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-feminist-rock-group-appeal-of-internet-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the band's appeal of an Internet ban on their videos. The court ruled that the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government was "extremist" and President Vladimir Putin argued that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population. In October Alekhina and Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred to separate regional prisons</a> [JURIST report] generally reserved for dangerous criminals to serve their two-year sentences. Earlier in October Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed on appeal</a> [JURIST report] because she did not actually participate in the protest song, and she vowed to take the band's case to the ECHR on charges that the Russian government had illegally detained them and also violated the rock group's right to free speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Ministry states that the seized newspapers were sold in violation of their publication licenses, which limit the distribution of opposition party newspapers to party members, not public retail sale. Malaysian authorities have also made <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/da6f1arg1/malaysia-charges-student-activist-with-sedition-arrests-3-other-anti-government-figures.html">several unpopular arrests</a> [AP report], including Tian Chua, a senior official in opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's <a href="http://www.keadilanrakyat.org/">People's Justice Party</a> [official website]; Haris Ibrahim, a rights activists who leads an anti-government group; and Tamrin Ghafar, an opposition party member, all of whom criticized the ruling <a href="http://barisannasional.org.my/">Barisan Nasional</a> (BN) [party website] party at a recent political gathering. Prosecutors have also charged student Adam Adii for making seditious statements. Malaysian law defines sedition as promoting hatred against the government, and if convicted, Adii could face three years in prison. Political tensions have been high since Malaysia's May 5 general elections in whichBN  won a weak majority of parliamentary seats. Opposition activists have staged a number of peaceful protests in response, alleging that BN has retained power since 1957 through the use of bogus ballots and other irregularities.

<p>In October a Malaysian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/malaysia-court-awards-damages-to-former-detainees.php">awarded damages</a> [JURIST report] to a group of five opposition politicians and activists who were unlawfully detained pursuant to the country's controversial <a href="http://ejp.icj.org/IMG/INTERNAL_SECURITY_ACT_1960.pdf">Internal Security Act of 1960</a> (ISA) [text, PDF], which permits indefinite detention without trial for terror suspects, dissidents and political opponents. Three politicians and two activists were detained without trial for two years after being arrested in 2001 following anti-government protests. Last year the <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/">Malaysian Parliament</a> [official website, in Malay] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/malaysia-lawmakers-approve-security-measures-law-replacing-sedition-law.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] aimed at replacing the ISA.

The report focuses on the increasing danger faced by those displaced from their homes. This includes international refugees displaced by violence and those internally displaced. More than 42 million individuals have been forced to flee from their homes because of violence or persecution. Specifically, the <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">fighting in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has displaced more than 1.5 million people. The report states:<blockquote>The most vulnerable are the 12 million stateless people in the world, equivalent in numbers to the world's great agglomerations such as London, Lagos or Rio. And around 80% of them are women. Without the protection of their 'sovereign' state these people are true global citizens. And their protection falls to all of us. They are the purest argument for the fulfilment of the duty to protect there is. For human rights protections must be applied to all humans, whether at home or not.</blockquote>The report goes on to highlight improvements and issues in specific countries. Notably, the report alleges both Israel and Palestine committed war crimes in November 2012. Also, the report highlights what AI calls a "deficit of justice" in the Brazilian justice system. Finally, the report notes New Zealand's high rate of child poverty as an area of needed improvement. 

<p>AI regularly reports on human rights violations around the world. In a recent comment, JURIST Guest Columnist Clare da Silva of AI <a href="/hotline/2013/05/clare-da-silva-arms-trade.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the new Arms Trade Treaty shows remarkable progress in the international regulation of arms transactions.

According to a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/humanrights/2013/05/201351583142509183.html">new policy</a> [Al Jazeera report], detainees are subject to a genital pat-down whenever they wish to leave the detention camp, which they must do to meet with their lawyers. This caused representatives for more than a dozen detainees to file the complaint, saying:<blockquote>The new policies have no legitimate purpose, but are pretextual, imposed in order to chill the right of access to counsel... The inescapable inference, however, is that the new policies have no legitimate purpose, but are pretextual, imposed in order to chill the right of access to counsel.

According to <a href="http://www.tolonews.com/en/afghanistan/10277-afghan-parliament-approves-2-paragraphs-of-4th-article-of-election-law">Tolo News of Afghanistan</a> [official website], the statutes in question will provide a legal framework for the quarantine of ballot boxes and the creation of a complaints commission. Both houses of the Afghan Parliament have been working with <a href="http://president.gov.af/en/news/17289">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official website] to establish <a href="http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/42d63a1b4.pdf">laws for the election</a> [unofficial statute translation, PDF] of his successor, and recent delays in the statutory process have threatened to delay the election itself. In order for the statute to become law, Karzai will have to approve it no more than 15 days after it was approved by <a href="http://wj.parliament.af/english.aspx">Parliament</a> [official website]. Voter registration for next spring's elections will open this Saturday, and these laws were passed with the legislative intent to provide security for voters, regardless of which candidate they support before the election season even begins.

<p>These developments come as a direct result of an April 2012 <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/">Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan</a> (IEC) announcement that it would change the country's parliamentary election proceedings in an effort to eliminate future fraud. That announcement was the result of problems with the previous election. In August 2011 Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/afghanistan-election-commission-proposes-voting-changes-to-prevent-fraud.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the special elections court that he had created to investigate election fraud in parliamentary elections. The court was criticized as a vehicle for overturning the electoral gains made by many of Karzai's political opponents. In June 2011 the court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/afghan-court-overturns-parliamentary-election-results-for-fraud.php">invalidated the election results</a> [JURIST Report] of nearly 25 percent of the assembly seats. Karzai then ordered that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-president-orders-delay-in-seating-of-new-parliament.php">seating of parliament be delayed</a> [JURIST report] by a month in order to further investigate the findings. Though Karzai conceded that the IEC retains ultimate authority on election results, the IEC stated that it would review the findings and documents of the court in the April 2012 announcement (above).</p>]]></content:encoded>

In Obama's first major speech on counterterrorism since his re-election, he addressed the war on terror: "Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue, but this war, like all wars, must end. That's what history advises. That's what our democracy demands." Rather than introduce new sweeping policies, Obama's speech reaffirmed his national security priorities. On drone strikes, the president noted that the US will only use drone strikes when a threat is "continuous and imminent," a nuanced change from the previous policy of launching strikes against any "significant" threat. Moreover, the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Defense Department</a> [official website], as opposed to the CIA, will now take charge of launching lethal drones. The president addressed the criticism on drone strikes, noting that the tragedy civilian casualties will haunt him, but he must weigh the alternatives. He defended the use of drones when unable to capture individual terrorists. Regarding Guantanamo, Obama stressed that he cannot close the facility on his own, but is taking steps at getting prisoners out. Of significance, he lifted a moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen. He also called on Congress to lift restrictions on the transfer of terrorism suspects.

<p>The Obama administration's counterterrorism projects have been highly criticized. Earlier this month Pakistan declared <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-declares-drone-strikes-illegal-directs-foreign-ministry-to-introduce-resolution-in-un.php">US drone strikes are illegal</a> [JURIST report] and directed Pakistan's <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] to introduce a resolution against such attacks in the UN. Last month JURIST Guest Columnist David Frakt of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law argued that the Obama administration should <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">release those detainees</a> [JURIST op-ed] held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US. Also last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for US authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-calls-for-guantanamo-prison-closure.php">close down the Guantanamo prison camp</a> [JURIST report], emphasizing the continued indefinite incarcerations of many detainees as a clear violation of international law. In March a federal appeals court judge in the US <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling on CIA drone strikes and held that the CIA must respond to a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] claim filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] requesting records on the CIA's drone program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the names of the accused were not released, the lawyer for Sami Lushtaku announced that his client is among those arrested. Lushtaku is the mayor of the town of <a href="http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13273">Skenderaj</a> [OSCE backgrounder, PDF], and is a close ally of Kosovo <a href="http://www.osce.org/kosovo/13273">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [official website]. Both men served as commanders in the guerrilla <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17907947">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) [BBC backgrounder] during the conflict. Allegedly, Kosovo's ambassador to Albania is also among those arrested. The five accused parties are charged with "war crimes against the civilian population in the form of violation of bodily integrity and health of civilians held in a KLA detention centre... also for... the killing of one civilian." The order for the arrest came from a pre-trial judge of the <a href="http://www.osce.org/kosovo/75526">Mitrovica Basic Court</a> [OSCE backgrounder, PDF] and will be prosecuted by the EULEX special prosecutor from the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/justice/prosecution.php">Special Prosecution Office of Kosovo</a> (SPRK) [official website].

<p>These arrests come on the heels of last month's <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/retrial-begins-against-kosovo-politician-accused-of-war-crimes.php">retrial of KLA leaders</a> [JURIST report], as well as a landmark agreement between <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/ci/ri/">Serbia</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/ci/kv/">Kosovo</a> [US State Department backgrounders] regarding <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-welcomes-landmark-agreement-between-serbia-and-kosovo.php">membership in the EU</a> [JURIST report]. Tensions have remained high between the two nations since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia, partly due to Serbia's refusal to recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. Last year <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/eulex-arrests-6-serbia-government-agents-in-kosovo.php">EU Kosovo officials arrested six Serbian officials</a> [JURIST report] in Kosovo, alleging that they were "suspected of exerting undue pressure ... not to recognize Kosovo institutions." In 2010 Serbia's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/serbia-parliament-rejects-kosovo-independence-in-perpetuity.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] stating that it would never recognize Kosovo as an independent nation. This resolution was passed days after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icj-rules-kosovo-independence-declaration-did-not-violate-international-law.php">did not violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

She said her view was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/23/us-usa-apple-ebooks-idUSBRE94M19A20130523">based largely</a> [Reuters report] on material submitted as evidence. The trial, set for June 3, will proceed in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. The DOJ's <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/">Antitrust Division</a> [official website] has reached settlements with <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon &#38; Schuster Inc.</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/doj-reaches-settlement-with-publisher-in-price-fixing-lawsuit.php">Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</a>, and Holtzbrinck Publishers LLC, known by the public as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/macmillan-settles-e-book-case-with-doj.php">Macmillan</a> [JURIST reports], leaving Apple as the sole defendant remaining in the litigation.

<p>The DOJ alleged that Apple, <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/">Hachette</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">HarperCollins</a>, <a href="http://www.macmillan.com/">Macmillan</a>, <a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/">Penguin</a> and <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/">Simon &#38; Schuster</a> [corporate websites] conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some commentators have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is merely <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">"superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books at a loss in order to drive the sale of Kindles. Other commentators, however, state that commentators against the settlement agreement and the defendants' arguments are based on a premise that <a href="/forum/2012/04/harry-gerla-ebook-pricing.php">competition is wrong</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Green family, founders of Hobby Lobby and its sister company Mardel, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/23/hobby-lobby-appeals-birth-control-obamacare">contend</a> [AP report] that businesses, not just the currently exempted religious groups, should be excepted from that part of the health law if it violates the business-owners' religious beliefs. The <a href="http://www.okwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma</a> [official website], from which the Green family appealed, <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Order-for-HL-PI.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that for-profit businesses are not covered by the exemption for religious organizations, which currently applies to churches themselves, but not to affiliated nonprofit corporations, like hospitals, which do not rely primarily on members of the faith as employees.

<p>Thursday's <em>en banc</em> hearing is the most recent development in the challenge by the Green family in its fight against the PPACA. In February a group of nine senators and two representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-legislators-join-hobby-lobby-in-challenge-to-contraception-mandate.php">joined to file an <em>amicus</em> brief</a> in support of Hobby Lobby and Mardel. Last December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] said it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">not intervene</a> [JURIST report] by issuing an injunction while an appeal was still pending with the Tenth Circuit, to which the Greens have responded that they will <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/two-businesses-will-not-comply-with-supreme-courts-order-on-contraception-mandate.php">not comply</a> [JURIST report] with the mandate even without a protective injunction. Justice Sonia Sotomayor ruled that the Oklahoma City family's religiously oriented business did not meet the requirements to allow an injunction against the PPACA's mandate. The opinion stated that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Three patents in question involve program products typically used in hand sets for a mobile phone. Thursday's suit brings the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2270425/nokia-goes-after-the-htc-one-with-another-patent-lawsuit">total number</a> [<em>Inquirer</em> report] of Nokia patents being asserted against HTC in courts around the world to 50.

<p>Nokia has a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nokia">long history</a> [JURIST news archive] of holding other companies accountable in the courts. HTC finds itself across the aisle from Nokia with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, Rhythm in Motion (known for their <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/smartphones/blackberry-z10/buy.html?CPID=KNC-kw379030_p6&HBX_PK=rim|32278df2-cfef-9da9-c265-000016da7950">Blackberry products</a>), the German law firm <a href="http://www.ipcom-munich.com/home_en.html">IPCom GmbH &#38; Co</a>, amongst others. For example, In March 2011 Nokia announced that it had filed <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nokia-files-new-round-of-patent-suits-against-apple.php">complaints against Apple</a> [JURIST report] with the US International Trade Commission (ITC). That complaint alleged that Apple violated seven patents regarding various technological devices and their operating systems. Previous to that announcement, Nokia and Apple had both sued each other over more than 20 patents in more than four countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This follows Tuesday's <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/images/documents/TJRC_report_Volume_4.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">connecting</a> [JURIST report] the Kenyan leaders to the violence. The African leaders' request stems from <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jqMSzWPyx1lhjapIOmk97FRNz1eQ?docId=CNG.42e0aca09ab3f2ce235f023c7b6dde42.621">accusations</a> [AFP report] by members of the African Union that the ICC targets African governments that do not please western leaders. The president and vice president of Kenya, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21544245">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uhuru+kenyatta">news archive</a>] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=william+ruto">William Ruto</a> [JURIST news archive], respectively, stand accused of inciting <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya">violence following the 2007 elections</a> [JURIST news archive] in which more than 1,100 people died. 

<p>This is the latest in the controversy surrounding Kenyatta and Ruto's involvement in the human rights violations. Despite the allegations, both were able to win the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">recent election</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month the Kenyan ambassador to the UN requested the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-un-ambassador-seeks-dismissal-of-icc-charges-against-president.php">drop the charges</a> [JURIST report] against Kenyatta and Ruto. Also this month the ICC continued to <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icc-postpones-trial-of-kenya-vice-president.php">postpone</a> [JURIST report] Ruto's trial. In April a judge overseeing Kenyatta's case <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-judge-withdraws-from-case-against-kenya-president.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the case, after the President's personal attorney requested that the charges be dropped. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The convictions stemmed from a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sentencing+scandal">juvenile sentencing scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] in which Ciavarella and judge Michael Conahan allegedly received $2.8 million in kickbacks from a commercial builder, an attorney and a businessman in exchange for helping to construct and operate two juvenile detention centers, and placing hundreds of juvenile offenders there. In August 2011 the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-for-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Ciavarella to 28 years in prison despite his eligibility for a life sentence under federal sentencing guidelines. On appeal, Ciavarella specifically challenged denial of his motions to disqualify the district judge, arguing that the judge had "improperly relied on extrajudicial statements" by commenting to the media and public before denying Ciavarella's plea agreement. The appellate court, however, found that the district judge's statements did not constitute the requisite bias required for disqualification under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/455">28 USC &#167; 455(a)</a> [text] because they did not display "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible." Pursuant to the ruling, Ciavarella will continue to serve his 28-year sentence in federal prison in Illinois. 

<p>Ciavarella's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/former-pennsylvania-judge-goes-on-trial-over-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in early February 2011. In December 2012 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-approves-settlement-in-pa-juvenile-sentencing-suit.php">approved a settlement</a> [JURIST report] of almost $18 million in a lawsuit brought by juveniles wrongfully incarcerated by the two judges. In July 2010 Judge Edwin Kosik <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a plea agreement from former judge Conahan for his involvement in the juvenile sentencing scandal. Conahan now faces a 20-year prison sentence, a fine of up to $250,000 and disbarment. Kosik had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] joint plea agreements from Conahan and Ciavarella, finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="/forum/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In October 2009 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">overturned 6,500 juvenile-offender convictions issued by Ciavarella</a> [JURIST report].  Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September 2009, following a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the guilty pleas they <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">entered</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In South Asia, those members of society who are of low caste are referred to as "Dalits" or "untouchables." The UN experts noted that Dalits endure "marginalization, social and economic exclusion, segregation in housing, limited access to basic services including water and sanitation and employment, enforcement of certain types of menial jobs, and working conditions similar to slavery." The experts emphasized that Dalit women and girls are particularly susceptible to abuse born from this type of discrimination. Besides urging countries to adopt legislation to combat case-based abuses, the UN experts also called on world governments to support and implement the <a href="http://idsn.org/uploads/media/UN_Principles_And_Guidelines_-_IDSN.pdf">UN Principles and Guidelines</a> [text, PDF] for the elimination of caste-based discrimination.</p>

<p>South Asian caste systems remain controversial. Last year <a href="http://hrnk.org">the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a> (HRNK) [advocacy website] reported that North Korea's caste system <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/north-korea-caste-system-leads-to-human-rights-violations-report.php">leads to abuses</a> [JURIST report] and human rights violations. In 2010 the Nepalese District Court in Baitadi <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/nepal-rights-groups-praise-court.php">issued two judgments</a> [JURIST report] against caste-based discrimination in Nepal. In 2008 the <a href=" http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-high-court-upholds-educational.php">upheld a government program</a> [JURIST report] reserving seats at India's top state schools for members of lower castes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to media sources, the bill originally included protections for commercial transactions, housing, governmental services, and public accommodations, but the Senate <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/puerto-rico-approves-anti-discrimination-bill-19253069#.UaEPKJVA_zI">voted</a> [AP report] to narrow to bill's scope to employment last week. The bill will now move back to the Senate, which is expected to approve the measure. In addition, <a href="http://prfaa.pr.gov/governornd2.asp">Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla</a> [official profile] has reportedly indicated his intent to sign the bill after its final approval. According to reports, Puerto Rico has enacted several other measures to foster equality in 2013, including an executive order which extends health insurance coverage to domestic partners of workers in the executive branch. In addition, the <a href="http://www.justicia.pr.gov">Puerto Rico Department of Justice</a> [official website] is reportedly prosecuting the nation's first hate-crime case.  

<p>LGBT and gender rights have been an issue in Puerto Rico in the past. In February Puerto Rico's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/puerto-rico-supreme-court-upholds-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law banning same-sex couples from adopting children. In a 5-4 judgment, the court upheld the constitutionality of a law making it legally impossible for a person to adopt a child if the potential adopter is of the same sex as the child's legal parent. Other nations have recently sought to make strides towards equality. In July Chile <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/chile-president-signs-hate-crime-bill.php">enacted an anti-discrimination law</a> [JURIST report] following the March 2012 beating death of a young gay man in a Santiago park. In June Ontario lawmakers on <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ontario-amends-anti-discrimination-code-to-include-transgender-protections.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the province's Human Rights Code that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

On May 25, 1993, the UN passed <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_827_1993_en.pdf">Resolution 827</a> [resolution, PDF], which established the ICTY as an "ad hoc measure" for the prosecution of "persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law" in the wake of "continuing reports of widespread and flagrant violations" occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the time, reports indicated "mass killings, massive, organized and systematic detention and rape of women, and the continuance of the practice of 'ethnic cleansing'" during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnia+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive], which left approximately 100,000 people dead and about 2.2 million homeless. Since its inception 19 years ago, the ICTY has indicted 161 persons. In addition the Security Council praised the forthcoming <a href="http://www.unmict.org">International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals</a> (MICT) [official website] located in the Hague. The UN established the MICT in December 2010 to take over the work of the ICTY and the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTR">news archive</a>] once their charters expire in 2014. The UN urged both tribunals to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44998&Cr=tribunal&Cr1=#.UaIpbZVA_zI">continue in the fight against impunity</a> [UN News Centre report].

<p>In March the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-bosnian-serb-policemen-sentenced-to-22-years-prison-for-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two former Bosnian Serb police officers to 22 years in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Bosnian civil war that spanned from 1992-95. Former interior minister Mico Stanisic and his subordinate, Stojan Zupljanin, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icty-begins-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">faced charges</a> [JURIST report] of persecution, extermination, murder, deportation and torture of Muslims and ethnic Croats, as part of a plan to establish "a Serb state, as ethnically 'pure' as possible." The ICTR was established by UN Security Council in 1994 to investigate and prosecute alleged prominent players of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Since then the ICTR has <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Cases/StatusofCases/tabid/204/Default.aspx">heard more than 70 cases</a> [ICTR case index] and is set to dissolve in 2014 after hearing its final 15 appeals in light of the completion of its trial mandate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In April the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of <a href="http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/info/default.aspx">parliament</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-upper-house-approves-new-election-law.php">approved the revisions</a> [JURIST report], which set forth new procedures for lower house elections to be held later this year. The law provided in part that the People's Assembly, Egypt's lower house of parliament, would consist of 546 seats, and the nations electoral map would be divided into 129 electoral districts. In addition the law <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/25/us-egypt-elections-law-idUSBRE94O07S20130525">mandated the removal</a> [Reuters report] of a long-standing prohibition of the use of religious slogans in electoral campaigning. The SCC reportedly found that removal of the provision would like result in political and social balkanization. According to media sources, it is still unclear whether the ruling will <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-25/egypt-court-blocks-articles-of-election-parliament-laws.html">interfere</a> [Bloomberg report] with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi's</a> [BBC backgrounder] plans to hold elections for the lower house before the end of the year. 

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In March the country's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed electoral law to the SCC for review, thereby delaying parliamentary elections originally set to begin on April 22. The court's decision was said to be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/06/us-egypt-elections-court-idUSBRE9250S320130306">based on technical grounds</a> [Reuters report], namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral law to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was amended in five key areas, as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">demanded by the high court</a> [JURIST report] in February. Also in March, the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution. Specifically, the complaints challenged the method for selecting the assembly's members, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report] by liberals and Christians as a misrepresentation of all Egyptians.

The judge ruled in their favor, but in December 2011 the Secretary of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website], <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Kathleen Sebelius</a> [HHS profile], intervened to block the ruling as it related to minors, citing inadequate evidence concerning adverse health effects. In April US District Judge Edward Korman <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] Sebelius' "unprecedented," decision, calling the prior requirement for adolescents under age 16 "unjustified and burdensome." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-appeals-emergency-contraceptive-age-limit-restriction-lift.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] from the decision in May, stating that the judge had overstepped his legal authority. Korman <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/12cv763MemoOrder5102013.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF] the government's request to stay the motion pending the appeal under belief that the request was "frivolous" and "taken for the purpose of delay." The government was later granted the current stay by the Second Circuit, to be extended until May 28. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Alberto Julio Candiotti, a former Argentinian military officer who was wanted for crimes committed during the country's 1976-1983 <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war">news archive</a>], was arrested Thursday in Montevideo, Uruguay. Information for the whereabouts of the 68-year-old, who was residing in the city with his wife, was valued at 100,000 pesos (USD $20,000). The former officer was arrested by Uruguay's National Police. Authorities are currently uncertain whether Candiotti sneaked into the country or falsified documents to gain admittance. 

<p>The "Dirty War" was a seven-year military dictatorship under which an estimated 30,000 people, many government opponents as well as ordinary citizens, were "disappeared" and taken to government facilities to be tortured and eventually killed. A court in Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/former-argentina-general-sentenced-to-life-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former military general <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] in March to life in prison for crimes against humanity. In February seven retired military officers were sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/argentina-retired-military-officers-given-life-sentences.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for various human rights abuses committed during the war. In December an Argentinian court sentenced former interior minister Jaime Smart to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for murder and detention of citizens. Smart was the first civilian minister to be convicted of crimes during the "Dirty War," but other civilians and police officers had been previously convicted. Two of Argentina's former dictators were also convicted in July of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/argentina-sentences-former-dictators-for-kidnapping-children-during-war.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] during the war and sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison.

In addition, the bill makes it a Class C misdemeanor to use an "unmanned vehicle or aircraft" to photograph or videotape "individual or privately owned property" within the state without the consent of its possessor. Exceptions include drone use by law enforcement officials during the course of executing "valid search or arrest warrant[s]," while in "immediate pursuit" of suspected felons and while investigating crime scenes involving "suspected human fatalit[ies]." However, lawmakers rejected a version of the bill that gave a blanket exception to law enforcement officials. Other exceptions include use by utility companies, use for "professional or scholarly research," and use in airspace designated as a "test site or range" by the US <a href="http://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) [official website]. The law's passage has been a <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20130526-ban-on-surveillance-from-unmanned-drones-gets-texas-lawmakers-approval.ece">contentious issue</a> [<em>Dallas Morning News</em> report] in Texas, with proponents arguing that technology has outpaced privacy law, and opponents contending that the law will make it more difficult to uncover and report natural and industrial accidents, thus depriving the public of valuable information. The bill passed the Senate and the House in early May before receiving final approval Sunday.

<p>Drone technology has been a divisive issue around the globe, especially with respect to the global war on terror. Earlier this month US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">delivered a speech</a> [JURIST report] on US counterterrorism policy and efforts, outlining plans to restrict the use of unmanned drone strikes and to renew efforts to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Also in May Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-declares-drone-strikes-illegal-directs-foreign-ministry-to-introduce-resolution-in-un.php">declared US drone strikes to be illegal</a> [JURIST report] and directed Pakistan's Foreign Ministry to introduce a resolution against such attacks in the UN. In March a US federal appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a ruling on CIA drone strikes, holding that the CIA must respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claim filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) requesting records on the CIA's drone program. Also in March a group of legal experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/legal-experts-tell-senate-drones-require-new-privacy-laws.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the growing need for new privacy laws because of the rapid advancement of drone technologies and their increased use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] originally gave the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) authority to enforce federal immigration law under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1357">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [8 U.S.C. Sec. 357(g), text] with up to 160 officers. The MCSO then issued procedures under DHS guidance instructing officers to "consider race or 'Mexican ancestry' as one factor among others'" in executing  "immigration enforcement operations" pursuant to federal law. The DHS later revoked the MCSO's authority under the INA, but, according to the court, Sheriff Arpaio and his deputies continued to "operate under the erroneous assumption" that they had authority to enforce alleged violations of federal immigration law. Sheriff Arpaio and the MCSO subsequently implemented a policy in which race constituted grounds for probable cause for the purposes of searching homes and vehicles during traffic stops. The court held: <blockquote>...[T]he MCSO has no authority to detain people based only on reasonable suspicion, or probable cause, without more, that such persons are in this country without authorization... [I]n the absence of additional facts that would provide reasonable suspicion that a person committed a federal criminal offense either in entering or staying in this country, it is not a violation of federal criminal law to be in this country without authorization in and of itself. Thus, the MCSO's...policy that requires a deputy...to detain persons she or he believes only to be in the country without authorization...[constitutes an] unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.   </blockquote>  Defense counsel for Sheriff Arpaio and the MCSO have announced <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/federal-judge-finds-violations-of-rights-by-sheriff-joe-arpaio.html?_r=0">plans to appeal</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] the decision in the coming days.

<p>In May 2012 the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/doj-files-discrimination-suit-against-arizona-sheriff.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Maricopa County, Arizona, the MCSO,\ and Sheriff Arpaio alleging that Arpaio and his department engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory and unlawful law enforcement actions against Latinos. In June lawyers for Sheriff Arpaio asked the US District Court for the District of Arizona in a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/arizona-sheriff-seeks-dismissal-of-discrimination-suit.php">dismiss the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] pending against him that claims his office discriminated against Latinos and disregarded their constitutional rights. Also in June Maricopa County asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/arizona-county-asks-to-be-dismissed-from-lawsuit-against-sheriff.php">dismiss the county</a> [JURIST report] from the DOJ's lawsuit against Sheriff Arpaio.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/27/world/meast/syria-civil-war/?hpt=hp_t3">expressed concern</a> [CNN report] regarding reports that describe the slaying of entire Syrian families and shelling of communities, as well as the targeted strikes by Syrian armed forces on hospitals and schools. Pillay <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22678130">called for the international community to end</a> [BBC report] what she has termed a "humanitarian disaster."

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian President <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile]. The increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. Earlier this month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php"> called for international action</a> [JURIST report] after a series of massacres was carried out against Syrian civilians.

There has been a circuit split on the issue. In this case, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5527898888580380560&q=United+States+v.+Rosemond,+695+F.3d+1151+%2810th+Cir.+2012%29&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that the offense requires proof only of knowledge, upholding Justus Rosemond's conviction for using a firearm during a federal drug-trafficking offense.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1036.htm">Mississippi ex rel. Hood v.

Appellants, manufacturers and distributors of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, jointly removed this case to federal district court on the grounds that the action was a "class action" or a "mass action" under the CAFA. The state of Mississippi then moved to remand the case to state court, and the district court granted the motion. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16945130566545382149&q=Mississippi+ex+rel.+Hood+v.+AU+Optronics+Corp.,+701+F.3d+796+%285th+Cir.+2012%29+&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that the suit qualifies as a mass action under the CAFA, finding removal to be proper and reversing the district court's remand order.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thaler</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-two-habeas-corpus-claims.php?edition=full">report</a>] that last term's decision in <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel-claim.php">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [JURIST report] on ineffective assistance of counsel claims should apply in this case. In <span class="casename">Martinez</span> an Arizona procedural rule required a defendant convicted at trial to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during his first state collateral review proceeding or lose the claim. Luis Mariano Martinez did not comply with the state procedural rule, but he argued that the federal <em>habeas</em> court should permit his claim because he lacked effective counsel both during trial and during his first state collateral review proceeding. The court ruled 7-2 that lack of counsel on collateral review might excuse defendant's state law procedural default. In this case Texas law appears to permit but not require that a defendant raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, but the Texas system makes it "virtually impossible" to do so. Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Breyer held that <span class="casename">Martinez</span> applies, vacating the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10533379879708776669&q=Trevino+v.+Thaler&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">judgment</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and remanding for further proceedings.

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Samuel Alito. Roberts argued that <span class="casename">Martinez</span> should be limited and should not extend to these circumstance. Justice Antonin Scalia also filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Scalia dissented for the same reasons set forth in his dissent from <span class="casename">Martinez</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perkins</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-two-habeas-corpus-claims.php">report</a>] that "actual innocence ... serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass" in a federal <em>habeas</em> action. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14288583663922904477&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Schlup v. Delo</a> (1995) and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12700869242131951963&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">House v. Bell</a> (2006) [opinions], the Supreme Court held that a convincing showing of actual innocence enabled <em>habeas</em> petitioners to overcome a procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their constitutional claims. In this case, the court considered the question in the context of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2244">28 USC &#167; 2244(d)(1)</a> [text], the statute of limitations on federal <em>habeas</em> petitions prescribed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The question before the court was, "if the petitioner does not file her federal <em>habeas</em> petition, at the latest, within one year of 'the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,' ... can the time bar be overcome by a convincing showing that she committed no crime?" In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court held that:<blockquote>[A]ctual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar, as it was in <span class="casename">Schlup</span> and <span class="casename">House</span>, or, as in this case, expiration of the statute of limitations. We caution, however, that tenable actual-innocence gateway pleas are rare. ... Our opinion clarifies that a federal habeas court, faced with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner's part, not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown.</blockquote>The court vacated the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8190545414955180466&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">judgment</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings.

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas and by Justice Samuel Alito as to Parts I, II and III. According to Scalia, "The gaping hole in today's opinion for the Court is its failure to answer the crucial question upon which all else depends: What is the source of the Court's power to fashion what it concedes is an "exception" to this clear statutory command?" Scalia argues that the court lacks such power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/egypt-president-sends-draft-ngo-law-parliament-210819388.html">most recent draft</a> [AP report] allocates wider financial autonomy to civic associations and NGOs. According to presidential aides, the bill does not require NGOs to hold their money in public funds and removes wording that required NGOs to receive foreign funds indirectly through a government bank account. The bill maintains that a steering committee composed of nine officials&#8212;four from the NGO community, four appointed by the Minister of Social Solidarity and the minister himself&#8212;will grant and reject NGO licenses. The committee may also object to NGO activities that exceed or contradict the groups mission and refer an NGO to a court to revoke their license. In a statement Monday, Morsi said the bill is aimed at committing NGOs to the principles of transparency and striking a balance with "the openness of Egypt" after the uprising that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The most recent draft also took into consideration concerns that had been raised by local and international groups including protection of raw materials, specifically sensitive witness testimony and permission to conduct broad voter awareness activities. 

<p>Egypt has been plagued by continuing political turmoil since the beginning of its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Earlier versions of the bill were <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-urges-egypt-to-protect-civil-society-groups-in-new-law.php">regarded</a> [JURIST report] as an attempt to regulate the work of civil society with loosely defined oversight and were compared to the autocratic policies of the Mubarak regime. Both the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> (CIHRS) [advocacy website] and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-rights-group-criticizes-proposed-ngo-restrictions.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] prior drafts as a "striking infringement" on the right to freedom of association. In April a number of Egyptian opposition groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-opposition-files-lawsuit-demanding-public-debate-of-budget.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] demanding public debate of the country's budget. Earlier in April the Shura Council <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-upper-house-approves-new-election-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] new election procedures to elect the House of Representatives. The process has been delayed, however, by Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-egypts-supreme-administrative-court.php">referring</a> [JURIST report] the newly passed law to the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) for review. The court's decision was said to be based on technical grounds, namely that the Shura Council failed to return the amended electoral to the SCC for final review before <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-upper-house-approves-court-ordered-changes-to-election-law.php">passing it</a> [JURIST report]. The law was amended in five key areas as <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/egypt-high-court-remands-parliamentary-election-law-to-legislature-for-amendment.php">demanded by the high court</a> [JURIST report]. In March the SCC <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/egypt-constitutional-court-dismisses-challenge-to-constitutional-assembly.php">dismissed complaints</a> [JURIST report] against the assembly responsible for drafting the country's new constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hun Sen has <a href="http://world.time.com/2013/05/27/cambodia-pm-seeks-law-to-punish-khmer-rouge-denial/">suggested</a> [AP report] that the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party shares the regime's philosophy by comparing their promise to cancel banking debts to the Khmer Rouge's eradication of the banking system in 1975. Opposition leader Kem Sokha also allegedly said that exhibits at the genocide museum were faked. Hun Sen's comments come ahead of the national election set for July 28, which he is expected to win in a landslide.

<p>Once a member of the Khmer Rouge himself, Hun Sen has used the regime to discredit his opponents and call for legislation to silence those who deny the movement's existence. In 2011 the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] began hearings for four former Khmer Rouge leaders. The four leaders included <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a> [ECCC profile], the regime's second-in-command and the group's chief ideologist, former head of state <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC profile], ex-foreign minister <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-sary">Ieng Sary,</a> [ECCC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ieng+Sary">news archive</a>] and his wife, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [ECCC profile], who served as minister for social affairs. The four, each of whom is over 80 years old, are the first top officials to face trial. They are charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture, but have pleaded not guilty to those charges.

Hathaway concealed assets while dealing with a bank to arrange a short sale on her home, which allowed her to sell her home for less than she owed and to avoid foreclosure. She claimed financial hardship in order to be approved for the sale, though she had over a million dollars in assets. The sentencing guidelines for the charge ranged from 12 to 18 months, and Hathaway's defense claimed that the irreparable harm that this had done to her reputation and career was sufficient punishment. Hathaway <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/cases/USAvHathaway/docs/4.Sentencing%20Memorandum%20Defendant.pdf">requested community service</a> [sentencing memo, PDF] rather than prison time, but US District Judge John Corbett O'Meara opted for the prison sentence and required that she pay $90,000 in damages. It is likely that Hathaway will be eligible to be released early and will serve as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/28/diane-hathaway-judge-prison-sentenced_n_3347977.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics">few as nine months</a> [AP report].  

<p>Hathaway <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/former-michigan-supreme-court-justice-pleads-guilty-to-fraud.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges in January. The charges were <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-prosecutors-file-charges-against-michigan-supreme-court-justice.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] as a result of a Detroit news <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/did-michigan-supreme-court-justice-play-a-shell-game-to-get-out-from-underwater-home">investigative report</a> [WXYZ report].

In October the UN called on nations around the world to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">combat judicial corruption</a> [JURIST report], stating that it is a human rights issue because it can deprive people of their due process rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sepulveda urged world governments to enable participation amongst persons living in poverty in decisions that affect their lives. She also recommended that states set up a legal and institutional framework to comply with human rights obligations relating to participation:<blockquote>States must make sustained and proactive efforts to ensure that the voices of people living in poverty can be heard in public debate and policy making. ... The right to participation is strongly linked with empowerment, which is a key human rights goal and principle. Effective participation can build capacity and rights awareness. It allows those living in poverty to see themselves as full members of society and autonomous agents rather than subjects of decisions taken by others who see them as objects of assistance or mere statistics.</blockquote>The special rapporteur also noted that states have a legal obligation to implement such participatory processes in the design, implementation and evaluation of policies and programs that affect the way people live. 

<p>The UN human rights office continues to push for improvements around the globe. Last month independent UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-experts-world-bank-must-adopt-human-rights-standards.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the World Bank to adopt human rights standards that will protect vulnerable populations.

Indiana's law went further than federal law, which already bans Medicaid funds to pay for abortions in most instances. Specifically, the measure, passed in 2011, blocked the <a href="http://www.state.in.us/isdh/">Indiana Department of Health</a> [official website] from signing contracts with any group that performs abortions, except hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers. It was later reversed by a federal appeals court, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">permanently blocking</a> [JURIST report] the law's enforcement.  

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a controversial issue across the US. In March North Dakota's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/north-dakota-governor-signs-restrictive-abortion-laws.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] restrictive abortion laws, which were <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/north-dakota-abortion-law-challenged.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website]. Earlier in March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." That law has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge. Days earlier Arkansas lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-ban-after-20-weeks.php">override</a> the governor's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/arkansas-governor-vetoes-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/HB1037.pdf">Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act</a> [HB 1037, PDF] which bans most abortions in the state 20 weeks after conception. That law made Arkansas the eighth US state to ban or restrict abortions after 20 weeks. Similar laws restricting reproductive rights are currently facing legal challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Crepeau visited both sides of the border in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.2_EN.pdf">Turkey</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46.Add.4_en.pdf">Greece</a>, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add1_en.pdf">Tunisia</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A-HRC-23-46-Add3_en.pdf">Italy</a> [official reports] to investigate the experience of migrants. He found that those irregular migrants related to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arab+spring">Arab Spring</a> [JURIST news archive] and global south were unduly targeted for security purposes that were ineffective and indirectly exploitative. Irregular migrants are those seeking economic opportunities that do not enter through a traditional visa program, usually because a sufficient program is not offered by the EU to support the seasonal work force required by its member states' economies. Crepeau <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.46_en.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] that such practices effectively limited legitimate opportunities for migrants upon entrance into the region:<blockquote>Within EU institutional and policy structures, migration and border control have been increasingly integrated into security frameworks that emphasize policing, defence and criminality over a rights-based approach. ... Opening up more regular migration channels, including for low-skilled workers, thus reflecting the real labour needs of the EU, would lead to fewer irregular border crossings and less smuggling of migrants.</blockquote>Crepeau noted that these economic limitations on migration influx often force migrant workers into the informal market, thus reinforcing the cycle of stereotypes that create the undue scrutiny for migrants before entry. He encouraged the EU to increase and standardize their policies regarding these workers so that they can enter the region legitimately and safely.

<p>Crepeau will report his findings to EU institutions  in Brussels on May 30-31, before the launch of the European Parliament. This report follows the recent report on <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/eu-concerned-over-russia-human-rights-record.php">human rights in Russia</a> [JURIST report], where many NGOs focused on human rights were labeled <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">foreign agents</a> [JURIST report], including many which seek to assist migrant workers. The UN condemned the law's "obstructive, intimidating and stigmatizing effects" on the country's NGOs and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-experts-urge-russia-to-revise-law-detrimental-to-ngos.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Russia to revise the law to comply with international standards. Critics have argued that President Vladimir Putin  is taking steps backwards toward a more restrictive government, claiming the law is curbing free speech and allows the government to severely penalize the works of NGOs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also prohibits retail marijuana stores from selling more than one-fourth of an ounce of marijuana to nonresidents. Another law, subject to voter approval in the November statewide election, <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/31D153749B49700187257B2F00580E15?Open&file=1318_01.pdf">imposes a 15 percent sales tax</a> [HB13-1318] on retail marijuana or retail marijuana products and distributes 10 percent of the total tax revenue among the state's local governments containing at least one retail marijuana store.

<p>The sale and use of marijuana remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. Earlier this month the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld Canada's general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled that the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php">proposed legislation for state-regulated marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Also that month Washington and Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives. Similarly, medical marijuana was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts</a> [<em>Harvard Crimson</em> report] for the first time, as over 60 percent of voters approved a similar referendum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW claims that the Kenyan police used grenades and other attacks to relocate refugees to camps "as an excuse to rape, beat, extort money from, and arbitrarily detain." According to HRW, the police consistently referred to their victims as terrorists, which HRW believes may be in response to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/world/africa/fatal-attacks-in-kenya-tied-to-incursion-into-somalia.html">attacks on law enforcement officials and civilians</a> [NYT report] by unknown perpetrators, beginning in October 2011. At least 50 cases of abuse by Kenyan police amounted to torture, and only one Kenyan national so far has been charged, according to the HRW report. HRW urged Kenyan authorities to immediately open an independent public investigation. 

<p>This is the latest controversy surrounding Kenya officials. Last week African foreign ministers agreed to request that Kenyan leaders accused of inciting violence following the 2007 elections stand trial in their home country rather than before the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court </a>(ICC) [official website] in The Hague. This follows a recent <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/images/documents/TJRC_report_Volume_4.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org">Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">connecting</a> [JURIST report] the Kenyan leaders to the violence. The African leaders' request stems from <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jqMSzWPyx1lhjapIOmk97FRNz1eQ?docId=CNG.42e0aca09ab3f2ce235f023c7b6dde42.621">accusations</a> [AFP report] by members of the African Union that the ICC targets African governments that do not please western leaders.

The sentences, ranging from 10 to 25 years, were handed down by a three-judge panel for crimes including murder, rape, illegal expulsion and torture of Muslims. The longest sentence of 25 years was given to <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/766/4">Jadranko Prlic</a> [case materials], former leader of the Croatian Community. The other high-ranking political or military figures convicted included Bruno Stojic, Slobodan Praljak, Milivoj Petkovic, Valentic Coric and Berislav Pusic.

In the ruling, Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti stated that the torture and murder of Muslims "were not the random acts of a few unruly soldiers, but part of a plan to permanently remove Muslims from territory claimed by Bosnian Croats."

<p>The trial against the six accused <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/icty-denies-croatia-bid-to-intervene.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in April 2006 and represents the most recent convictions against individuals responsible for human rights abuses during the Bosnian Civil War, which left approximately 100,000 people dead and about 2.2 million homeless.

<p>The imprisonment of members of Pussy Riot sparked an international outcry against the Russian political and judicial system. Last week a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/member-of-feminist-rock-group-pussy-riot-denied-parole.php">denied parole</a> [JURIST report] to Pussy Riot member Maria Alekhina. In April a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/member-of-russia-feminist-rock-group-denied-parole.php">denied parole</a> [JURIST report] for Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, who had requested it so that she could look after her young daughter. In February the band <a href="paperchase/2013/02/russia-feminist-rock-group-appeals-conviction-to-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] challenging their conviction. They contend that their conviction violates four articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. In January a court <a href="g/paperchase/2013/01/russia-court-denies-feminist-rock-group-appeal-of-internet-ban.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the band's appeal of an Internet ban on their videos. The court ruled that the band's videos questioning the role of religion in Russian government was "extremist" and President Vladimir Putin argued that the ban is protecting the beliefs of the Russian Orthodox population. In October Alekhina and Tolokonnikova were <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/two-members-of-russia-feminist-rock-band-transferred-to-regional-prisons.php">transferred to separate regional prisons</a> [JURIST report] generally reserved for dangerous criminals to serve their two-year sentences. Earlier in October band member Yekaterina Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed on appeal</a> [JURIST report] because she did not actually participate in the protest song, and she vowed to take the band's case to the ECHR on charges that the Russian government had illegally detained them and also violated the rock group's right to free speech.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a speech on Wednesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13372&LangID=E">noted</a> [statement] that the recent fighting in Al-Qusayr has left the town with shortages of food, water and medical supplies while forcing hundreds to flee from their homes. Intense shelling and increased clashes between government and rebel groups, Pillay claims, continue to endanger the lives of civilians in Al-Qusayr. The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate with civilian death tolls rising daily. Pillay further called for the anti-government forces to more clearly distinguish themselves from civilians and urged both sides to do more to allow civilians to flee the city. In addition, Pillay expressed her concern for the growing number of international fighters that are crossing the Syrian border to fight for either side. There is evidence to suggest that an influx of foreign fighters has incited increased violence, both in quantity and severity of violence. This fact, Pillay explained, is a sign that the fighting is long from over and even when the broader fighting ends, these groups may continue to incite violence along religious or ethnic lines. To counter this, Pillay urged the international community to come together in Geneva for a conference surrounding these issues. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile]. Earlier this week Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the human rights rights violations going on in Syria. Earlier this month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called for international action</a> [JURIST report] after a series of massacres was carried out against Syrian civilians. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/%22">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the Syrian Air Force for <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in rebel-controlled areas. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">accused Syria's military</a> [JURIST report] of using widely-banned cluster bombs against civilians. In February Pillay reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-syria-death-toll-rising-security-council-must-take-action.php">death toll after two years</a> [JURIST report] of armed conflict approached 70,000. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNSMIL noted that the preparation and drafting of the constitution is a significant part of Libya's democratic transition, and the representation and participation of women throughout the process will greatly contribute to the growth of the country. Libyan women had a significant role in the February 2011 revolution and participated in Libya's first free elections in over four decades. As elections for the Constitution Drafting Assembly approach, the UN is stressing how important the participation of women is in rebuilding the nation. For the elections last year, special measures were adopted to allow 32 women to win seats in the parliament. These special measures, such as quotas, have greatly contributed to women's representation in public life and are on par with international standards and obligations. 

<p>Ongoing efforts in Libya continue trying to ensure a properly-functioning justice system and promote reconciliation after the 2011 conflict. In March Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-libya-government-to-ensure-protection-of-civilians.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Libya government to ensure the protection of civilians.

The charges included inciting the killing of protesters during the revolution, wasting public funds, embezzlement and abuse of power.

Their clients have allegedly been held for over eight months without charge and without access to lawyers in what could be a breach of international law. Applications for <em>habeas corpus</em> were issued on behalf of two of the men in April, and the military has ordered a hearing in July. UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-defence">Defense Secretary Phillip Hammond</a> [official website] insisted that the holdings are in compliance with international law and that there are regular inspections by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [official website]. He <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22691655">explained</a> [BBC report] that standard military procedures, which required the detainees to be released to Afghan forces after 96 hours, were changed in November due to suspicions about the use of torture on prisoners by the Afghan forces. According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defense</a> [official website], the detainees are being held in Camp Bastion until a safe path through the Afghan system could be assured. 

<p>Last year an Afghan detainee who was handed over to authorities in Afghanistan by UK forces won permission to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-permits-afghan-detainee-to-challenge-legality-of-transfer.php">challenge the legality of the transfer</a> [JURIST report] in a UK court. Before the High Court of Justice in London, Serdar Mohammed claimed that he had been transferred by British forces to a prison in Afghanistan where he was tortured by the Afghanistan intelligence service until he confessed that he was a member of the Taliban. The court felt there was "an arguable case" that required being heard out by a jury in order to determine the legality of the transfer. Observing the potential for torture, British forces have temporarily halted any future transfer of detainees to Afghanistan. Following the policy shift, a Ministry of Defense spokesperson claimed that UK does not transfer detainees to facilities where there is a risk of torture. In 2010 a UK court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-court-rules-detainees-must-be-protected-from-possible-abuses.php">restrictions</a> [JURIST report] must be placed on whether British soldiers in Afghanistan may transfer detainees to Afghan-run detention facilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision by the three-judge panel concluded the state must identify which government workers it believes should undergo periodic testing:<blockquote>In limited circumstances, where privacy interests implicated by the search are minimal, and where an important government interest furthered by intrusion would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individualized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion...[T]herefore, the test we apply is a job-category-by-category balancing of the individual's privacy expectations against the Government's interests.</blockquote>Scott said that he would continue to argue that all state workers should be tested for drug use. 

<p>Scott's executive order represented a significant expansion of the state's drug testing policy, which only permitted drug testing in more limited circumstances, including safety sensitive positions. In 2012 a judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/federal-judge-rejects-florida-employee-drug-testing.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the executive order, concluding that it violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The Florida government also faced a legal challenge to a different drug-testing law. In October 2011 a judge for the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] a new Florida law that had required welfare applicants to pass a drug test before receiving benefits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A key concern to Heyns is whether future weapons systems will be allowed to make the decision to kill on their own, without human intervention:<blockquote>Machines lack morality and mortality, and as a result should not have life and death powers over humans...[I]n addition to being physically removed from the kinetic action, humans would also become more detached from decisions to kill&#8212; and their execution.</blockquote>In his submission to the UN, Heyns compared LAR's to the experience of drones, which were initially intended for surveillance purposes, but are now used offensively to carry out targeted killings. 

<p>While the legality of drone use has been a controversial issue around the world for many years, many states are actively exploring the development of autonomous weapons operating on the ground including the US, Israel, South Korea, the UK, China and Russia. According to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], the US has spent approximately $6 billion a year on research and development of unmanned systems. In a <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300009p.pdf">directive</a> [text, PDF] adopted in 2012, the Pentagon stated that fully autonomous weapons could only be used to apply non-lethal, non-kinetic force, such as some forms of electronic attack. The <a href="http://www.stopkillerrobots.org/">Campaign to Stop Killer Robots</a> [advocacy website], coordinated by HRW and other civil society groups, works to preemptively ban LAR's through international treaty, national laws and others measures to ensure that lethal force against a human being is always made by a human being.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling reverses <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit</a> [official website] Judge Richard Niess's March 2012 decision, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/second-wisconsin-judge-finds-voter-id-law-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the law's photo ID requirement would disenfranchise voters who lack the resources to obtain such ID. The law <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/30/wisconsin-appeals-court-voter-photo-id-constitutional/">requires</a> [AP report] voters to show either a state-issued ID card, valid driver's license, US passport, a student ID that expires within two years or a military ID.

<p><a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php#voterid">Voter ID laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become increasingly controversial and commonplace throughout the US. There are now more than <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">30 US States</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including multiple states that have passed laws requiring photo ID. In April the Arkansas House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-voter-id-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-governor-vetoes-voter-id-legislation.php">veto</a> [JURIST report] of a bill requiring voters to provide photo ID in a 52-45 vote, making the bill an official Arkansas law. In March Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/virginia-governor-signs-voter-id-bills-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] legislation requiring voters in the state present photo ID prior to voting. Lawyers for Pennsylvania and the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> [advocacy website] reached an accord in February <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/pennsylvania-voter-id-law-suspended-for-primary-election.php">extending the temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] of the Pennsylvania voter ID laws and allowing state residents to vote in the upcoming primary and special elections without submitting ID.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kenyatta and his deputy president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=william+ruto">William Ruto</a> [JURIST news archive] are charged with crimes against humanity for their alleged involvement in inciting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">violence that followed the 2007 election</a> [JURIST news archive] and which led to more than 1,100 deaths. Ruto's trial has been recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icc-postpones-trial-of-kenya-vice-president.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report], and Kenyatta's trial is currently scheduled to begin in July. Bensouda said the ICC was always <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/30/us-icc-kenya-idUSBRE94T0LY20130530">ready to engage in debate</a> [Reuters report] regarding the Kenya proceedings.

<p>This is the most recent in the ongoing controversy surrounding the trials of Kenyatta and Ruto. Last week African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Kenyatta and Ruto by tried in Kenya instead of by the ICC after the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Kenyan Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] connecting Kenyatta and Ruto to the post-election violence. Earlier this month, Kenya's ambassador to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-un-ambassador-seeks-dismissal-of-icc-charges-against-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed. In April a judge overseeing Kenyatta's ICC case <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-judge-withdraws-from-case-against-kenya-president.php">requested to be excused</a> [JURIST report] from hearing the case. Even with charges for crimes against humanity pending against him, Kenyatta was able to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">win a controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency in March. Kenyatta was sworn in as the country's fourth president following a <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/kenya-supreme-court-upholds-presidential-election-results.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from Kenya's Supreme Court that the election results were in fact valid. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Manjoo noted that while the most pervasive form of violence against women in the country is domestic violence, a number of women have also been victims of rape, sexual harassment, forced marriage and acid attacks, among other forms of abuse. Manjoo <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45037&Cr=Bangladesh&Cr1=#.Uag7do6nUzT">acknowledged</a> [UN News Centre report] the positive steps that have been taken by the Bangladeshi government to further the protection of women in the country, but she also recognized the need for strong policy enforcement as well as an overall change in attitude regarding women's role in society. Among the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13374&LangID=E">conclusions</a> [statement] Manjoo reached over the course of her 10-day visit to Bangladesh were that the Bangladeshi government must remove the impediments faced by women attempting to access the justice system as well as implement legislative measures to prohibit forced and early marriages. Manjoo will present a report to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in Geneva regarding her visit to Bangladesh in June 2014.

<p>The UN has recently focused on the issue of violence against women in a variety of contexts and countries. In March more than 130 UN member states <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-member-nations-adopt-plan-to-end-violence-against-women.php">agreed to adopt new measures</a> [JURIST report] to prevent and eliminate violence against women. This agreement came as a result of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-officials-encourage-reform-on-international-womens-day.php">UN urging</a> [JURIST report] governments to take decisive measures to protect women's rights. In December the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] declaring that women in Afghanistan are still suffering abuse at the hands of men. In November the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] that called for a global ban on female genital mutilation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Knaul discussed these recommendations in a presentation of her latest <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?si=A/HRC/23/43">report</a> [materials] to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. In her report, Knaul concluded:<blockquote>Legal aid is an essential element of a fair, human and efficient system of administration of justice that is based on the rule of law. It is a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial and the right to an effective remedy, a precondition to exercising such rights and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the administration of justice.</blockquote>Knaul also observed that as the purpose of legal aid is to contribute to the elimination of obstacles that restrict access to justice by providing assistance to people otherwise unable to afford legal counsel, beneficiaries of legal aid should include any person who comes in contact with the law and does not have the means to pay for counsel, not only those facing criminal proceedings. 

<p>The right to counsel has been the subject of numerous court cases worldwide in recent years. In August the <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/india-high-court-rules-defendants-entitled-to-legal-aid-at-all-levels-of-the-judiciary.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that persons accused of crimes are entitled to free legal representation in all courts, not just at the trial level. In February 2011 the Supreme Court of India <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-supreme-court-finds-constitutional-right-to-counsel.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that courts could not decide a criminal case without a lawyer present for the defendant, and should appoint counsel where the defendant cannot obtain a lawyer. In October 2010 the UK Supreme Court ruled that Scottish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uk-supreme-court-rules-suspects-have-right-to-counsel-during-interrogations.php">could no longer question a suspect in custody</a> [JURIST report] without the presence of a lawyer. A week earlier the French Court of Cassation ruled that all persons in custody of French law enforcement, including terrorism suspects, are <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-high-court-rules-terror-suspects-have-right-to-lawyer.php">entitled to consult with lawyers</a> [JURIST report] from the outset of criminal proceedings.

The <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/">Connecticut Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&bill_num=6495&which_year=2013&SUBMIT1.x=0&SUBMIT1.y=0&SUBMIT1=Normal">legislation</a> [HB 6495] Thursday that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses regardless of documentation status. If signed by <a href="http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/site/default.asp">Governor Dannel Malloy</a> [official website], the bill would allow those immigrants without proper documents from the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis">US Citizenship and Immigration Services office</a> [official website] the ability to obtain a driver's license for the purpose of highway safety. Applicants would have to prove identity with a passport or other document and show that they had been living in Connecticut for at least 90 days, but would not need to show permission from the US to be in the country. Senator Art Linares and fellow opponents to the bill noted the <a href="http://ctsenaterepublicans.com/2013/05/why-i-voted-no-on-the-bill-to-allow-undocumented-immigrants-to-get-state-drivers-licenses/#.Uah-6EDvv_w">lack of infrastructure</a> [press release] established to verify immigrants' identities using the approved foreign documents. Senator Martin Looney <a href="http://www.senatedems.state.ct.us/pr/looney-130529.php">summarized the debate</a> [press release] between pragmatism and immigration concerns as follows:<blockquote>This is an important public safety measure that ensures drivers on the road possess the necessary qualifications and insurance. ... The need to earn a living does not vanish just because a person does not have the appropriate immigration credentials. Not only is driving itself illegal for them, but without a legal license, these drivers cannot purchase the required insurance.</blockquote>The bill passed the Senate with a vote of 74-55, and will go to the governor for approval next week.  

<p>Similar laws have already passed in <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/maryland-senate-approves-bill-permitting-undocumented-immigrants-to-receive-drivers-licenses.php">Maryland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/-or-illegalimmigrants-or-immigration.php">California</a> [JURIST reports]. Opponents to the Connecticut bill focused on the federal government's evolving immigration policies that they argued would make this measure unnecessary. One such act is the <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/senate-judiciary-approves-immigration-bill.php">Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration reform bill</a> [JURIST report], which creates a 13-year path to citizenship for the same group of undocumented immigrants. <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Similar laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] around the country have developed at the state levels over the past year to lessen the burden of obtaining documentation, especially for students who are the children of undocumented immigrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the local divisions of the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> and the <a href="http://napawf.org/">National Asian Pacific American Woman's Forum</a> [advocacy websites] and seeks to have the law declared unconstitutional. Senior Counsel for the ACLU-AZ <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/issues/press-releases/2013-05/3748">stated</a> [press release] that the law was designed to insinuate that female minorities may be convinced to abort a fetus based on a racist plot against their own demographic, but the Republican sponsors of the act insisted the rationale was to prevent discrimination.

<p>This lawsuit comes on the heels of several developments in controversial state abortion statutes. Earlier this month Arizona's <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">ban on abortions after 20 weeks</a> [JURIST report] was deemed to violate women's rights. Last Friday a judge for the <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/default.cfm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas</a> [official website] temporarily blocked enforcement of a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-to-proceed.php">law banning abortions 12 weeks into a pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation. Montana voters in November passed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring notice to parents of minors before a planned abortion procedure. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that the prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/stanisic_simatovic/cis/en/cis_stanisic_simatovic_en.pdf">Jovica Stanisic</a> [case materials, PDF], a close ally of late Serbian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=milosevic">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive], and counter-intelligence official Franko Simatovic, planned or ordered crimes against humanity. The ruling was welcomed by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, but disappointed victims of wartime atrocities as the acquittal means that no Belgrade government official has yet to be convicted of crimes committed during the Bosnian Civil War.

<p>The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/former-serb-paramilitary-commanders-go.php">began</a> the war crimes trial of Stanisic and Simatovic in 2008, and the ruling comes just days after the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icty-convicts-6-bosnian-croat-leaders-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] six Bosnian Croat political and military leaders of crimes against humanity. Thursday's acquittal marked the most recent setback for the prosecutors at the tribunal. In February Serbian general <a href="w.icty.org/x/cases/perisic/cis/en/cis_perisic_en.pdf">Momsilo Perisic</a> [ICTY profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/icty-overturns-ex-yugoslav-army-chiefs-war-crimes-conviction.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia on appeal.

The ruling came in response to a case filed by a citizen in an attempt to get Mugabe to announce election dates. Rights activist Jealousy Mawarire had originally sought elections by June 29. Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku said that would be impossible but that Mugabe had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/31/us-zimbabwe-election-idUSBRE94U0OG20130531">violated</a> [Reuters report] Mawarire's rights but not announcing an election date.

Mugabe, 89, has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence from the UK in 1980. After the country's disputed elections in 2008, Mugabe and his political rival, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6439617.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morgan+tsvangirai">news archive</a>] formed a coalition government and found a compromise to hold elections on the condition that a new constitution was enacted beforehand. Zimbabwe has been criticized for the state of its legislative and electoral environment. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/zimbabwe0113webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] issued by <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], the organization said that the country must take adequate steps to ensure "credible, free and fair elections" in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

El Salvador banned all abortions in 1999. However, the woman suffers from lupus and kidney problems, which means that her pregnancy poses a great risk to her health. The fetus suffers from a serious condition causing only partial brain development and little or no chance of survival after birth. The IACHR asked El Salvador to provide the woman with the measures necessary to preventing irreparable damage to her rights to life, physical integrity and health, in compliance with its nonbinding resolution and <a href="http://www.oas.org/dil/treaties_B-32_American_Convention_on_Human_Rights.pdf">Articles 4 and 5 of the American Convention</a> [text, PDF], and to report to the Court by June 7. 

<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Home/">Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/News/Taoiseach%27s_Speeches_2013/Speech_by_the_Taoiseach,_Mr_Enda_Kenny_TD,_Protection_of_Life_during_Pregnancy_Bill_2013,_1st_May_2013.html">introduced</a> [speech transcript] the <a href="http://www.merrionstreet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Protection-of-Life-During-Pregnancy-Bill-PLP-30.04.13-10.30.pdf">Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013</a> [text, PDF], which would establish new rules determining when abortions may be performed to save the life of the mother. The proposed law would not significantly change the country's strict laws on abortion, but rather would provide doctors with clarity on how to assess whether an abortion is medically necessary. The prime minister clarified that abortion would be legally permitted only if it is "unanimously certified that it is the only treatment that will save the woman's life." The law would also set a maximum 14-year penalty for the performance of an abortion deemed not to be medically necessary. The proposed legislation came shortly after the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion in Ireland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill mirrors a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nigeria-senate-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">bill approved by the Senate in November 2011</a> [JURIST report].

Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.or/jurist_search.php?q=muammar+gaddafi">news archive</a>]. The ICC ordered the Libyan government to turn over Saif al-Islam, who is currently being held in Zintan, Libya, where he is facing war crimes charges in a Libyan court. The ICC's decision dismisses a <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/libya-challenges-iccs-right-to-try-gaddafis-son.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] filed by the Libyan government last year claiming the ICC did not have jurisdiction over the case. The court's decision on Friday found that the Libyan judicial system was not prepared to handle Saif al-Islam's trial, and thus jurisdiction falls to the ICC. The Libyan government may appeal the ICC ruling. 

<p>The issue of which court is going to try Saif al-Islam has been in dispute since he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/gaddafi-son-captured-by-libya-rebel-forces.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] by Libyan rebel forces in 2011. Saif al-Islam first <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/muammar-gaddafis-son-makes-first-appearance-in-libya-court.php">appeared in court</a> [JURIST report] in Zintan in January. Libya has continued to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/libya-denies-request-to-hand-over-gaddafis-son-to-icc--dnp.php">refuse to hand over</a> [JURIST report] the accused war criminal to the ICC. In October 2012 Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to allow Libya to try Saif al-Islam as well as former Gaddafi intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi, promising fair trials. In August of that year Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly.

The ruling, which was issued on May 20, was released to the public on Friday. Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2709">18 USC &#167; 2709</a> [text], the FBI can issue national security letters without court approval, requiring telecommunication companies to turn over information about their subscribers. Furthermore, the nondisclosure provision of the law prohibits the telecommunications companies from revealing anything pertaining to the national security letters, including notifying the individual for which information was sought. In this case, Google is challenging the validity of 19 NSLs. Judge Susan Illston ruled that Google must comply with the FBI requests unless NSLs are found unconstitutional. In March, Illston issued a ruling in a separate case finding that <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-rules-national-security-security-letters-unconstitutional.php">NSLs are unconstitutional,</a> [JURIST report], but the order was stayed for 90 days pending a government appeal.  

<p>Google has faced criticism for numerous privacy issues recently. In April, six European countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">commenced</a> [JURIST report] legal action against Google regarding its privacy policies. Also in April, Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">agreed to a $7 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] for its collection of improper data during its Street View campaign. Last December an Italian appeals court overturned the conviction of three Google executives for <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">violating Italian privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by posting a video on Google of a handicapped child being bullied. In June 2012 a Switzerland court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/switzerland-court-partially-rules-for-google-in-privacy-case.php">found for Google</a> [JURIST report] in a privacy suit involving its Street View service. Similarly, in March 2011 a Berlin court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Google, holding that the controversial Street View service is legal in Germany. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban called upon both parties to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45060&Cr=Syria&Cr1=#.Uao434leui0">make greater efforts to avoid civilian casualties</a> [UN News Centre report] and emphasized that the government of Syria has obligations to protect civilians in their territories. Ban also reminded those involved in the fighting in Syria that the international community is closely following the activities of both sides of the conflict, and those responsible for abuses will be held accountable. Specifically, Ban expressed the "gravest concern" about the recent fighting in the Western town of Al-Qusayr which has displaced more that 3,500 refugees over the last several weeks. 

<p>The <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad [BBC profile].

In May, Pillay <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called for international action</a> [JURIST report] after a series of massacres was carried out against Syrian civilians. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/%22">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the Syrian Air Force for <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in rebel-controlled areas. In March HRW <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">accused Syria's military</a> [JURIST report] of using widely-banned cluster bombs against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the constitutional panel has already dissolved, the legislature's upper house, the <a href="http://www.shoura.gov.eg/%28S%28jlw2nzpwppgigftdhe04fojd%29%29/App_Ara/default.aspx">Shura Council</a> [official website, in Arabic], will not be dissolved until the parliament's lower chamber is elected later this year or in early 2014.

<p>This ruling is the latest episode stemming from the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egypt Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in 2011.

In April several Egyptian opposition groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-opposition-files-lawsuit-demanding-public-debate-of-budget.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] demanding the government open up the draft budget for public debate.

The approval of this bill follows a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-the-us-court-of-1.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that Illinois' previous concealed carry prohibition was unconstitutional because the ban violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text]. Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] has not announced whether he intends to sign the bill into law, but a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/us/illinois-lawmakers-race-for-compromise-on-guns.html">deadline of June 9</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] has been established to pass a law permitting the carrying of concealed weapons. If the bill is signed into law, Illinois will join the other 49 states in approving some type of concealed weapon. 

<p>The bill is the latest development in the ongoing Second Amendment and gun control debate. In April the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a>  [official website] declined to hear <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-new-york-concealed-carry-law.php"> a challenge to a New York state gun law</a> [JURIST report] requiring those who desire to carry a concealed handgun to show they have a special reason before they can obtain a license. In March Utah Governor Gary Herbert <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/utah-governor-vetoes-concealed-weapons-bill.php">vetoed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have allowed people to carry an unloaded, concealed gun without a permit. Also in March the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-maryland-concealed-carry-permit-restrictions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Maryland can require concealed-carry handgun permit applicants to provide a "good and substantial reason" for wanting to carry a gun outside the home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police forces dispersed peaceful protests with tear gas, water canons and plastic bullets, triggering wider public protests across the country. The historic park has symbolic meaning to minority political parties, many of which claim that this was the first step in an unpopular regime plan to build over the park with a shopping mall. Sunday's events came as a result of informal critique by Turkish public officials, including <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17992010">President Abdullah Gul</a> [BBC backgrounder], as the construction halted and restarted several times from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22744728">May 27 to June 1</a> [BBC report]. Police forces routinely dispersed protesters in order to further the construction, sending at least one representative to the hospital for a heart attack. An adviser for  <a href="http://http://www.mfa.gov.tr/bakan-genel.tr.mfa">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish] denied the use of excessive force on Saturday and chastised the protesters. High Representative of the [European] Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/index_en.htm"> Catherine Ashton</a> [official website] called for talks between the two sides.

<p>This outbreak of violence comes about one month after Turkey's Grand National Assembly <a href="http://www.bianet.org/english/politics/145791-parliament-approves-new-judicial-reforms">approved amendments</a> [BIA summary] to the country's anti-terrorism laws to bring them more in line with EU freedom of expression standards. In February the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] urged Turkey to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/council-of-europe-urges-turkey-to-speed-up-legislation-reform.php">move more quickly</a> [JURIST report] in its efforts to reform the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee </a>(UNHRC) [official website] criticized Turkey in November for <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST report] under the country's vague counterterrorism law. In March 2011 a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Turkish officials to <a href="/hotline/2011/04/justice-must-be-brought-to-turkish-journalists.php">respect journalists' freedom of expression</a> [JURIST comment]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

King</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that police may collect DNA samples from individuals arrested and charged with serious crimes. The respondent in the case, Alonzo King, challenged the validity of Maryland's <a href="http://www.goccp.maryland.gov/dna/documents/legislation.pdf">DNA Collection Act</a> [text, PDF] after state officials used his DNA to implicate him in a later crime. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the majority found that the warrantless DNA collection does not violate arrestees' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. Kennedy wrote:<blockquote>In light of the context of a valid arrest supported by probable cause respondent&#8217;s expectations of privacy were  not offended by the minor intrusion of a brief swab of his cheeks. By contrast, that same context of arrest gives rise  to significant state interests in identifying respondent not  only so that the proper name can be attached to his charges but also so that the criminal justice system can make informed decisions concerning pretrial custody. Upon these considerations the Court concludes that DNA identification of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be  considered part of a routine booking procedure. When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee&#8217;s DNA is, like fingerprinting  and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>The ruling reverses the <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/maryland-high-court-strikes-down-dna-collection-law.php">decision</a> of the Maryland Court of Appeals, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/supreme-court-stays-maryland-injunction-on-state-dna-collection-law.php">temporarily stayed</a> [JURIST reports] by Chief Justice John Roberts last July.

<p>Kennedy's majority opinion was joined by the chief justice and by Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Scalia criticized the court's comparison of DNA collection to other techniques, such as fingerprinting: "The Court's assertion that DNA is being taken, not to solve crimes, but to identify those in the State's custody, taxes the credulity of the credulous. And the Court's comparison of Maryland's DNA searches to other techniques, such as fingerprinting, can seem apt only to those who know no more than today&#8217;s opinion has chosen to tell them about how those DNA searches actually work."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=manning">news archive</a>] started Monday at Forte Meade, Maryland, nearly three years after his <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">initial arrest</a> [JURIST report]. Manning faces a variety of charges related to his release of thousands of classified military documents that were later published on <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website]. The most serious charge is that of aiding the enemy, which comes with a life sentence. While Manning's supporters hail him as a political martyr, the <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/bradley_manning_trial_begins_history_kzLbQl0GwrEFqoZyJis6vL">prosecution has characterized</a> [AP report] him as a soldier who dumped hundreds of documents onto the internet and into enemy hands.

<p>This case has been controversial since the arrest of Manning in 2010. In April the <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/newcaaf/home.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces</a> [official website] rejected a request by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr-et-al-v-usa-and-lind-chief-judge#files">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] to have access to court documents from the case. That month the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] so that the state must prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. In February <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">Manning pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against him for providing classified materials to Wikileaks. Also in February the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/military-judge-rejects-wikileaks-defendants-request-to-dismiss-charges.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a defense motion arguing that Manning should be released based on a lack of a speedy trial. In January the judge ruled that prosecutors must prove that Manning knew he was aiding the enemy and that the treatment he received while in military custody was <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/military-judge-rules-pre-trial-punishment-of-wikileaks-defendant-was-illegal.php">illegal and excessive</a> [JURIST reports]. In November the judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/military-judge-accepts-plea-terms-of-army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a partial guilty plea to several of the minor charges against Manning. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that the lack of transparency in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June the judge ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly withheld from the defense during discovery. Prior to that, Manning was held in solitary confinement at the <a href="http://www.quantico.marines.mil/UnitHome.aspx">Quantico Marine Base</a> [official website] brig for 112 days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The refugees indicated that Kosheib appeared to be involved in the attacks by groups of men that used police-style vehicles, equipment and uniforms. HRW noted that the UN Security Council will be briefed by the ICC prosecutor this Wednesday and called on the Security Council to pressure Sudan to surrender Kosheib.

Maretta</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a Virginia law insurance beneficiary law is preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/8705">Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Act of 1954</a> (FEGLIA) [text]. Jacqueline Hillman was widowed by her husband, Warren Hillman. Warren's ex-wife, Judy Maretta, was designated the beneficiary for his FEGLIA proceeds. Hillman sued under  <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+20-111.1">Va. Code Ann. &#167; 10-111.1(D)</a> [text], which the Virginia Supreme Court ruled was preempted by FEGLIA. In an opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court affirmed that ruling:<blockquote>The [FEGLIA] establishes a life insurance program for federal employees. FEGLIA provides that an employee may designate a beneficiary to receive the proceeds of his life insurance at the time of his death. ... Separately, a Virginia statute addresses the situation in which an employee&#8217;s marital status has changed, but he did not update his beneficiary designation  before his death. Section 20-111.1(D) of the Virginia Code renders a former spouse liable for insurance proceeds to whoever would have received them under applicable law, usually a widow or widower, but for the beneficiary designation. ... This case presents the question whether the remedy created by &#167;20-111.1(D) is pre-empted by FEGLIA and its implementing regulations. We hold that it is.</blockquote>Sotomayor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Scalia joined as to all parts except footnote 4, which discusses the legislative history. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito filed concurring opinions.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-first-amendment-aids-funding-question.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. Counsel for Hillman argued that "Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so that the Federal interest ends once the insurance proceeds are paid out. FEGLIA was established to enable Federal employees to carry out their responsibilities to their families. And Congress knew that some of its employees would get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws to help make sure that these family duties and obligations were carried out, because Congress doesn't want to get into the&#8212;the business of regulating the divorce." Counsel for Maretta argued that FEGLIA creates an absolute right to direct proceeds that cannot be interfered with. "[W]e are not dealing with the generally applicable body of law; we are dealing with something that is quite openly an attempt to do an end run on preemption. The only thing that triggers section D is being a former spouse and receiving the proceeds. The statute doesn't make any inquiry into intent, into whether there has been a tort or an independent contract. It simply reallocates the proceeds. It substitutes a new beneficiary."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case, which was filed more than a year ago, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/03/us-apple-ebooks-trial-idUSBRE95210420130603">accuses Apple</a> [Reuters report] of working with major publishers to increase the price of their e-books. Five publishers,  <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers L.L.C., Simon &#38; Schuster Inc.</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/doj-reaches-settlement-with-publisher-in-price-fixing-lawsuit.php">Penguin Group (USA) Inc.</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/macmillan-settles-e-book-case-with-doj.php">Macmillan</a> [JURIST reports], were named in the complaint, but have since reached a settlement with the government. Apple continues to maintain it was simply acting in the company's interest and not doing anything illegal. However, the government claims this was a conspiracy to raise prices so that Apple could have a larger share of the e-book market. 

<p>Late last month Judge Denise Cote <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-believes-doj-will-prevail-in-apple-antitrust-case.php">gave her tentative opinion</a> [JURST report] that the government will be successful in their claim. The DOJ alleged that Apple, <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/">Hachette</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">HarperCollins</a>, <a href="http://www.macmillan.com/">Macmillan</a>, <a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/">Penguin</a> and <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/">Simon &#38; Schuster</a> [corporate websites] conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April 2012, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some commentators have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is merely <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">"superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books at a loss in order to drive the sale of Kindles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement was reached at the end of the Fifth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD V) in Yokohama, Japan. The new Plan of Action attempts to combat these problems through an integrated approach that attacks the causes of this type of illegal activity&#8212;poverty. Specifically, in the Sahel region of Africa, the group will attempt to address these growing problems by increasing crop production and manufacturing systems so that legitimate economies may thrive. Japan announced that it will also be contributing $1 billion to the $32 billion fund to increase efforts over the next five years.

<p>This is the latest in the fight against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=drug+trafficking">drug</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=human+trafficking">human trafficking</a> [JURIST news archives].

Last September the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-report-drug-trafficking-threatens-rule-of-law-in-central-america-caribbean.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report saying drug trafficking in Central America and the Caribbean threaten the rule of law in those regions. Also in September US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/obama-signs-order-strengthening-protections-against-human-trafficking-by-parties-to-federal-contract.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an executive order strengthening protections against human trafficking.

His <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/APe11954f1a3124c9789d1ab2ba779f21f.html">extradition</a> [AP report] is the result of charges for allegedly killing and torturing enemy soldiers during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+war">Bosnian War</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mujagic was fighting for the Army of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia when he and his men allegedly killed an enemy combatant with an AK-47, as well as kicked and beat enemy combatants with rifle stocks. At a detention hearing in December, Mujagic denied all charges and claimed that an individual in BiH was tortured until he or she produced the allegations against him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontegyptflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] An Egyptian court on Tuesday convicted 43 foreign and domestic non-governmental organization (NGO) employees of promoting democracy in Egypt without proper documentation and of receiving funds from abroad in violation of Egyptian law. Those convicted include Europeans, Egyptians, other Arabs and at least 16 Americans, 15 of whom were convicted <em>in absentia</em>. The court <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-egypt-ngosbre9530c4-20130604,0,4467897.story">ordered closure</a> [Reuters report] of the NGOs after meting out fines and prison sentences to employees ranging from one to five years. Affected NGOs include the US-based <a href="http://www.iri.org/">International Republican Institute</a> (IRI), <a href="http://www.ndi.org">National Democratic Institute</a> (NDI), <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org">Freedom House</a> (FH), the <a href="http://www.icfj.org">International Center for Journalists</a> and the <a href="http://www.kas.de/wf/en/">Konrad Adenauer Foundation</a> [advocacy websites]. The IRI <a href="http://www.iri.org/news-events-press-center/news/iri-statement-ruling-egyptian-court-case-against-democracy-workers">responded to the verdicts</a> [press release], calling the decision "a politically motivated effort to squash Egypt's growing civil society" carried out in part by "Mubarak-era hold overs." The IRI further asserted that it would "pursue all avenues" to challenge the decision, which "raises serious questions" with respect to Egypt's "commitment to the democratic transition" after Egypt's 2011 <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In addition the NDI <a href="http://www.ndi.org/Egypt-statement-june-2013">expressed</a> [press release] shock and deep distress over the "unjust conviction." The NDI's statement elaborates further on the role of pro-democracy NGOs in Egypt before and after the ruling:<blockquote>NDI's programs in Egypt included sharing international experiences on democratic transitions, training for the long-term development of political parties, and assistance to civil society organizations engaged in election monitoring, civic education and nonpartisan voter education. At no time has NDI ever funded any political party or movement. The Institute has never sought a particular electoral outcome, and it has never aligned itself with any political party, ideology or candidate. Those wrongfully convicted were ultimately the victims of an intergovernmental dispute between the U.S. and the then-Egyptian government. The Egyptian authorities at the time claimed that the U.S. democracy assistance funds were intended instead for use by them.</blockquote>All affected NGOs expressed their intent to appeal the decision in the near future. 

<p>Egypt's crackdown on NGOs has drawn criticism for years, especially with respect to the trial at issue. In May Egyptian President Mohammad Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/egypt-president-sends-ngo-bill-to-parliament.php">sent a bill</a> [JURIST report] to the country's interim parliament on Monday that would regulate NGOs. In April the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-rights-group-criticizes-proposed-ngo-restrictions.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] draft legislation restricting the financial autonomy of civic associations and NGOs. The trial at issue has been going on since 2011. In February 2012 Egyptian investigative judges <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-ngo-employees-to-face-trial.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] to a criminal court in Cairo the cases of the 43 NGO employees. Also in February 2012 a Cairo Criminal Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-court-adjourns-trial-of-ngo-employees-until-april.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] the trial of the NGO employees until April following the first day of the trial. During the same time all three judges responsible for adjudicating the criminal prosecution of the NGO employees <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-judges-withdraw-from-ngo-case.php">withdrew</a> [JURIST report] from the case. In March 2012 Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/egypt-appoints-new-judges-in-NGO-trial.php">appointed new judges</a> [JURIST report] to hear the trial just days after six indicted Americans left the country pursuant to a $5 million bail payment funded by the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendments narrowed the law's proscriptive scope, prohibiting only persons who, "with intent to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit," fraudulently hold themselves out to be recipients of certain military honors. Those found guilty under the law will be subjected to fines, up to one year in federal prison or both. Both houses of congress <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/06/obama-signs-stolen-valor-act-into-law/">approved the amendments</a> [ABC News report] in May after clearing alterations to provisions <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">found unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court in June 2012. The law as originally enacted set forth a blanket ban on all false military representations. However, the Supreme Court invalidated the law, holding that the government cannot punish statements merely because they are knowingly false, which would effectively grant the government authority to "compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable" in violation of the First Amendment. The court found that such a governmental power would have "no clear limiting principle." The court's dissenting opinion, however, would have upheld the law as originally enacted in keeping with the tradition of barring other serious untruths, including fraud, perjury and defamation. It remains to be seen whether claimants will challenge the now-narrower version of the law.  

<p>The SVA has been litigated in federal courts since then-president George W. Bush signed the bill into law in 2006. The appeal to the Supreme Court came in the case of <span class="casename">US v. Alvarez</span>, in which the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">declared the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011. Although the panel conceded that Congress's intentions were "praiseworthy," it found that the law required courts to "extend inapposite case law to create an unprecedented exception to First Amendment guarantees" and was "not narrowly drawn" enough to survive First Amendment scrutiny. Alvarez was arrested after he gave a speech before the Three Valley Water District board of directors in California, to which he had recently been admitted, in which he claimed to be a retired marine and the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. However, in January 2012 the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/tenth-circuit-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors-is-constitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the SVA was constitutional and not a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech as applied in another case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judges expressed dismay at the quality of evidence submitted, insinuating that it was not strong enough to merit a trial, but not weak enough to dismiss the charges. Specifically, the court recommended that the prosecution strengthen the proof that the election-based violence was related to Ggabo's political chain of command.

<p>A 2012 report from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.48_Extract.pdf">National Commission of Inquiry</a> [official summary, PDF] found both pro-Gbagbo and pro-President Alassane Ouattara forces responsible for serious international crimes. However, of the 150 individuals arrested and charged, none was of the pro-Ouattara forces. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Ouattara to fulfill his commitment to justice for the victims of those events. While the Ivorian government has increased the national budget amount allocated to the justice sector from 2 to 3 percent, the report asks the government to develop a more comprehensive prosecutorial strategy, establish a witness protection program and provide security for judges, prosecutors and defense lawyers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Both France and the US have claimed to have found evidence regarding the limited use of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/25/world/meast/syria-civil-war">Sarin</a> [CNN report], a toxic gas, but it is not clear which side was using it in the conflict. The UN did not independently confirm the name of the toxic agent used. The report did, however, state that:<blockquote>War crimes and gross violations of international human rights law&#8212;including summary execution, arbitrary arrest and detention, unlawful attack, attacking protected objects, and pillaging and destruction of property&#8212;have also been committed. The tragedy of Syria's 4.25 million internally displaced persons is compounded by recent incidents of IDPs being targeted and forcibly displaced.</blockquote>According to a UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13402&LangID=E">press release</a> [text], "The commission remains convinced that a political settlement is the only means of stopping the violence."

<p>The Syrian Civil War has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Syrian <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [official website]. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] released a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp">statement</a> [text] on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-secretary-general-calls-for-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">condemning the most recent violence</a> [JURIST report] in Syria, and expressing concern over how it has been affecting the civilian population. Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] condemned the recent violence in Qusayr and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">criticized</a> [JURIST reports] the broader human rights violations taking place in Syria. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called for international action</a> [JURIST report] after a series of massacres were carried out against Syrian civilians. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the Syrian Air Force for <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in rebel-controlled areas. In March <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">HRW accused Syria's military</a> [JURIST report] of using widely-banned cluster bombs against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report is the first of its kind and concludes that the war on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">marijuana</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a failure, with billions of dollars wasted on racially biased arrests. The ACLU found that marijuana possession arrests, and racial disparities in these arrests, increased between 2001-2010, even though black and white pepole use marijuana at a similar rate. The ACLU is hoping to push for a smart and fair reform, and the report offers suggestions on policy and policing:<blockquote>To repair this country's wrecked War on Marijuana, the ACLU recommends that marijuana be legalized for persons 21 or older through a system of taxation, licensing, and regulation. Legalization is the smartest and surest way to end targeted enforcement of marijuana laws in communities of color, and, moreover, would eliminate the costs of such enforcement while generating revenue for cash-strapped states. ... If legalization is not possible, the ACLU recommends depenalizing marijuana use and possession for persons 21 or older by removing all attendant civil and criminal penalties, or, if depenalization is unobtainable, decriminalizing marijuana use and possession for adults and youth by classifying such activities as civil, not criminal, offenses.</blockquote>The ACLU also recommends that, in the meantime, law enforcement agencies and district attorney offices should deprioritize enforcement of marijuana possession laws.

<p>Marijuana remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. Last month the Vermont State Legislature approved a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/vermont-legislature-votes-to-decriminalize-small-amounts-of-marijuana.php">replaces criminal penalties with civil fines</a> [JURIST report] for possession of up to an ounce of marijuana and up to five grams of hashish. Also in May the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. Additionally, the top court in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Canada's general ban on marijuana. In December an Arizona judge ruled that the state's <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. In November lawmakers in Uruguay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uruguay-lawmakers-propose-legislation-for-state-regulated-marijuana.php"> [JURIST report] proposed legislation</a> for state-regulated marijuana. Also that month Washington and Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized the drug</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives. Similarly, medical marijuana was <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalized in Massachusetts </a>[Harvard Crimson report] for the first time, as over 60 percent of voters approved a <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">similar referendum</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/12/burundi-new-law-would-muzzle-journalists">prohibits stories</a> [HRW report] that could affect Burundi's "national unity; public order and security; morality and good conduct; honor and human dignity; national sovereignty; the privacy of individuals; the presumption of innocence" or issues involving "propaganda of the enemy of the Burudian nation in times of peace as of war" and "information that could affect the credit of the state and the national economy." The law requires journalists to have a university degree in journalism or a minimum of two years of professional journalistic experience to report. Violators face fines ranging between USD $2,000 and $6,000. 

<p>Human rights organizations such as <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="http://en.rsf.org">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy websites] have criticized the bill saying it violates Burundian journalists' freedom of speech. RSF <a href="http://en.rsf.org/burundi-new-law-s-promulgation-sets-04-06-2013,44574.html">said</a> [RSF report] "the new law restricts journalists' ability to do investigate reporting," and "the country has gone backwards more than 20 years." In May, the National Communication Council (CNC) <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2013/jun/04/press-freedom-burundi">suspended for 30 days</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] a Burudian newspaper's online forum. The council said the reader's comments violated the law, specifically "endangering national unity, public order and security." The newspaper has responded by suspending its entire website until July 1. In May 2011 journalist Jean Claude Kavumbagu was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/18/burundi-journalist-acquitted-treason-charges">acquitted of treason charges</a> [HRW report] after being arrested in July 2010 for questioning the Burundian army and their capability to defend in an article. He was found guilty of being likely to "discredit the state or economy." </p>]]></content:encoded>

AI's report said 26,121 people were reported disappeared or missing between December 2006 and December 2012, but 40 percent of the cases were not investigated. Further, AI reported there was "compelling evidence to presume the direct or indirect involvement of public officials in at least 85" cases. The rights group said, "Even though the Mexican government has now partly recognized the magnitude of disappearances in the country, it has yet to acknowledge the involvement of federal, state and municipal agents in many of the cases." The federal justice system has only convicted two people for enforced disappearances and AI demands that the Mexican government ensure that there is an enforceable separate criminal offense of enforced disappearances that guarantees that all reported disappearance are fully investigated.

<p>Enforced disappearances refers to the practice of placing people in secret detentions for weeks or months without ever being brought before a judge. In March 2012 UN High Commission for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-chief-decries-enforced-disappearance-as-one-of-the-worst-crimes.php">cited enforced disappearances</a> [JURIST report] as one of the most heinous crimes.

The OHCHR is responding to days of violent clashes between police and protestors. The protests began on Friday in Istanbul, before spreading elsewhere in Turkey, to voice citizens' discontent with plans to redevelop the historic Taksim square and Gezi park. There has been a high number of arrests, and many people have been injured as riot police used tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons against the peaceful protesters. This action in turn prompted attacks on authorities. OHCHR spokesperson Cecile Pouilly announced:<blockquote>We are concerned about reports of excessive use of force by law enforcement officers against protestors who initially gathered to express their dissatisfaction with the redevelopment of the historic Taksim square&#8212;an important venue for political protests&#8212;and Gezi Park, and against others who joined demonstrations to support them throughout Turkey. We welcome the acknowledgment on the part of authorities that disproportionate force may have been used and their call for an investigation of law enforcement officers who are alleged to have broken the law and violated international human rights standards. Such investigations should be prompt, thorough, independent and impartial, and perpetrators should be brought to justice.</blockquote>The OHCHR also encourages the authorities to begin a genuine dialogue with civil society, discussing the projects in Taksim square and Gezi park.

<p>On Sunday Human Rights Watch (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-turkey-should-end-police-violence-against-protestors.php">called on police</a> [JURIST report] to use non-violent tactics with civilians.

In February the Council of Europe <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/council-of-europe-urges-turkey-to-speed-up-legislation-reform.php">urged Turkey to move more quickly</a> [JURIST report] in its efforts to reform the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism. In November the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">criticized Turkey for prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST report] under the country's vague counterterrorism law.

The ruling states that Apple violated one of Samsung's patents on two different claims dealing with encoding and decoding a wireless protocol. The ban <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/06/05/u-s-trade-agency-rules-for-samsung-bans-iphone-4-imports/">ends Apple's ability to sell these devices</a> [AP report] in the US since the devices are assembled in China. President Barack Obama can invalidate the order within 60 days. Apple has stated that it will appeal the ruling.

<p>This patent ruling is most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] between Apple and Samsung that spans over four continents. In March Apple requested that the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/apple-seeks-new-trial-on-damages-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">grant a new trial on damages</a> [JURIST report] in its patent infringement dispute against Samsung. In December Judge Lucy Koh <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-overseeing-apple-samsung-lawsuits-requests-temporary-ceasefire.php">requested a temporary "ceasefire"</a> [JURIST report] in litigation while she determined whether to reduce Samsung's damages to Apple. In October a judge for the ITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">issued a preliminary ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four of Apple's patents relating to smartphone design and touchscreen technology. Also that month, the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> on an Apple software patent; a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> on an Apple design patent; and Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/japan-reports-rejections-of-samsung-patent-infringement-claims-against-apple.php">defeated</a> [JURIST reports] patent infringement claims made by Samsung in Japan, overcoming Samsung's attempt to enjoin iPhone sales in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The website has been banned since September, after an anti-Islam movie appeared on the site. The movie, titled <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19572912">Innocence of Muslims</a> [BBC backgrounder], is a spoof film that characterizes the Prophet Mohammed as a fool and womanizer. Sunil Kanti Bose, head of the Bangladesh Telecom Regulatory Body, said that the <a href="http://www.courant.com/business/sns-rt-us-bangladesh-youtubebre9540qw-20130605,0,264397.story">ban has been lifted</a> [Reuters report] because it was hurting many individuals who use YouTube for beneficial purposes.

<p>Upon its release last September, the anti-Islam movie incited a rapid and violent uprising in the Middle East, including an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/john-christopher-stevens-us-ambassador-to-libya-dies-at-52/2012/09/12/b1c00cee-fcd0-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html">US Ambassador Christopher Stevens</a> [WP obituary] and three other Americans dead. The same month of its release, a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/brazil-court-orders-youtube-to-remove-anti-islam-film-from-site.php">Brazilian court ordered</a> [JURIST report] that YouTube remove the film from its site. A UN Special Rapporteur <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-condemns-violent-protests-over-anti-islam-film.php">condemned the violent uprising</a> [JURIST report] that occurred in response to the film. A judge in California, where the film was produced, <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/jurist-a-judge-for-the.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by an actress in the film to grant a temporary restraining order to remove the film from YouTube. Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-usa-clinton-film-idUSBRE88D0E820120914">US had nothing to do with the anti-Muslim film</a> [Reuters report] despite its apparent production in America, in turn labeling it disgusting and reprehensible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclusandiego.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013-06-04-Voluntary-Departure-Complaint-FINAL.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleges that immigration officers in Southern California are misusing a process known as "voluntary departure" by wrongly telling individuals that they will be incarcerated for months if they do not sign deportation documents. Individuals have also been told that after signing these documents and returning to Mexico they can easily "fix" their papers and may then return to the US. The lawsuit seeks class action status, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/alcu-lawsuit-challenges-deportation-procedures-claiming-voluntary-removals-are-coerced/2013/06/04/d8b445f0-cd76-11e2-8573-3baeea6a2647_story.html">requests that authorities revamp procedures</a> [AP report] to, among other things, fully explain the consequences individuals will face upon agreeing to leave the country. 

<p>This lawsuit is the most recent of those filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrants facing a variety of allegedly unconstitutional state immigration practices. In December the ACLU filed a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/aclu-sues-arizona-governor-for-denying-drivers-licenses-to-illegal-immigrants.php">challenging an Arizona governor's executive order</a> [JURIST report] that prevented certain immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses. In November the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-mandatory-immigrant-detention.php">on behalf of New Jersey immigrants</a> [JURIST report] that challenged the state's mandatory detention procedures. Earlier in 2012 the ACLU reported that certain immigrant detention centers in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/aclu-calls-for-immediate-remedy-of-arizona-immigrant-detention-conditions.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/aclu-criticizes-georgia-immigration-detention-centers.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports] were unsanitary, failed to give inmates proper access to medical treatment and denied inmates due process. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bales <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/05/us-usa-afghanistan-trial-idUSBRE9540H720130605">admitted</a> [Reuters report] to leaving his post last March in the Kandahar province in order seek out and murder civilians. Bales read the individual charges against him detailing each specific instance in detail. The murders represent the worst case of murder of civilians on the part of military personnel since the Vietnam War. Once the plea deal is accepted by the court martial judge, Bales will be given life in prison without the possibility of parole. 

<p>This is the latest development in the case against Bales. The prosecution announced last November that they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/us-military-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">seek the death penalty</a> [JURIST report].

The charges of alcohol and steroid usage was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-army-amends-charges-in-afghan-shootings-case.php">added</a> [JURIST report] last June. The first charges were <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-soldier-charged-with-17-counts-of-murder-in-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last March. There have also been other incidents of US military personnel killing civilians. Last February the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against Army Specialist Michael Wagnon, the last of five soldiers to be charged in connection with the killing of three Afghan civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A one-pill version will continue to be subject to age restrictions pending appeal. The Obama administration had sought to block a lower court order making the pills available to all women without a prescription, regardless of age. The order directs the US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] to implement the previous ruling as to the two-pill version. Those who support the court's ruling claim any age restriction will place a burden on women seeking the drug even when the meet the age limit.

The judge ruled in their favor, but in December 2011 the Secretary of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website], <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Kathleen Sebelius</a> [HHS profile], intervened to block the ruling as it related to minors, citing inadequate evidence concerning adverse health effects. In April US District Judge Edward Korman <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] Sebelius' "unprecedented," decision, calling the prior requirement for adolescents under age 16 "unjustified and burdensome."

Negotiations began last October after the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building/queens-bench">Queen's Bench Division</a> [official website] on the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-court-allows-kenya-ex-prisoners-to-sue-for-colonial-era-torture.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that three elderly Kenyans could sue the British government for torture they suffered while in detention under the British Colonial Administration. The victims <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/05/us-britain-kenya-maumau-idUSBRE9540YC20130605">alleged they had been tortured and sexually assaulted</a> [Reuters report] by their captors during the <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Press-Pack-Historical-Background-to-the-Mau-Mau-Claims_1.doc">Mau Mau uprising</a> [Leigh Day &#38; Co. backgrounder, DOC]. A formal announcement on the exact number of victims and amount of compensation included in the settlement is expected as early as Thursday.

<p>The settlement agreement marks the culmination of a legal struggle that began in 2009. In July 2011 High Court Judge Richard McCombe <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/uk-court-allows-kenya-citizens-to-sue-uk-government-for-torture.php">rejected the government contention</a> [JURIST report] that the alleged abuses occurred too long ago and that all liability of the colonial administration passed to the Kenyan government upon gaining independence in 1963. The Kenyans <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/former-kenya-rebels-sue-uk-over.php">first sued the British government</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to bring to court their allegations that they were abused in British Colonial prison camps. The Mau Mau rebellion was led by members of the largely impoverished <a href="http://www.africaguide.com/culture/tribes/kikuyu.htm">Kikuyu tribe</a> [Africa Guide backgrounder] and lasted from 1952-1960. The uprising was notorious for atrocities committed by both the rebels and British colonial forces. Official casualty figures eventually set the number of European deaths at 32 and the number of Kenyans killed at just over 11,000. Approximately 90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/uk-high-court-rules-3-mau-mau-rebellion-torture-victims-can-proceed-compensation-claims">during the crackdown</a> [AP report] against the Mau Mau, according to the<a href="http://www.khrc.or.ke/"> Kenya Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Presenting the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/ICC-OTP-UNSC-Dafur-ST-05June2013-ENG.PDF">briefing</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], Fatou Bensouda characterized the situation as having "gone from bad to worse," citing the fact 300,000 people have been displaced in the first five months of 2013, more than were displaced in the last two years. Bensouda outlined the continuing humanitarian crisis in Darfur:<blockquote>[T]he ongoing aerial bombardments in Darfur, which can only be attributed to one party in this conflict; the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war; the deliberate imposition of restrictions on delivery of humanitarian aid even in the face of an urgent humanitarian crisis; and the ongoing impunity for these crimes are major problems for Darfur and for all of us who care about what happens to the Darfuri victims who suffer the brunt of these crimes.</blockquote>She also voiced encouraged both the UN and the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> [official website] to work together to end criminal impunity of Sudanese government groups. The prosecutor expressed a need to strengthen the relationship between the ICC and the Security Council, as a way to better combat human right violations around the globe. The briefing is the seventeenth provided by the court since the situation was referred to the ICC through <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/85FEBD1A-29F8-4EC4-9566-48EDF55CC587/283244/N0529273.pdf">Resolution 1593</a> [text, PDF] in 2005.

<p>The continued violence has been a major issue in Sudan. In June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Ali Kosheib, former militia leader turned officer of the Sudan Central Reserve Police, was<a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-suspect-seen-at-new-sudan-crime-scenes-hrw.php"> spotted in an attack</a> [JURIST report] against Salamat communities in Central Darfur in April. Last December Bensouda told the UN Security Council that they are <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icc-un-security-council-must-do-more-in-darfur.php">not doing enough</a> [JURIST report] to root out Sudanese war criminals. In October the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Sudanese government to investigate an attack on one of its convoys, noting that since the establishment of <a href="http://unamid.unmissions.org/">African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur </a>(UNAMID) [official website] in December 2007, 43 peacemakers have been killed. In August the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sudan to investigate violence against protesters in Darfur.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court order, granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to the FBI in April, requires Verizon to turn over information about phone calls between the US and foreign countries and phone calls within the US. The order compels the production of metadata, including location, time and call duration, but does not include content of calls. The order is set to expire July 19. The Obama administration has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/06/nsa-verizon-phone-records-white-house_n_3395423.html">defended the data collection</a> [AP report] as an important tool in the war against terror.

FISA has been controversial since its inception in 1978 and remains controversial in <a href="/feature/featured/911/">post-9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] America. Last year scholars argued that the law <a href="/forum/2012/02/tung-yin-fisa.php">too heavily favors the government</a> by creating an impossible evidentiary burden for defendants and that Congress may have <a href="/forum/2012/02/jimmy-gurule-fisa.php">chosen to protect national security interests</a> [JURIST op-eds] over those of criminal defendants without considering the constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This ruling is a retroactive interpretation of the <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/fs20020717_1bvf000101en.html">Civil Partnership Act of 2001</a> [official text, in English, German], which recognized civil unions, but did not explicitly grant those tax benefits. Unions where one partner remained at home can now file jointly by pooling their incomes under one household and receiving respective benefits. Partners affected by the retroactive ruling can now apply for refunds for the past 12 years of over payment. 

<p>The Federal Constitutional Court in February <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/ls20130219_1bvl000111.html">ruled</a> [judgment, in German] that same-sex couples in a civil union can <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">legally adopt</a> [JURIST report] the non-biological children of their partners. In August the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples in a civil union should receive the same tax benefits as heterosexual married couples with regard to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-constitutional-court-rules-equal-tax-benefits-for-same-sex-couples.php">land transfer tax</a> [JURIST report], further noting that the decision should apply retroactively. That ruling came during the same month that 13 members of the country's ruling<a href="http://www.cdu.de/"> Christian Democratic Union</a> (CDU) [party website, in German] called for same-sex couples to be granted joint-filing tax benefits. In August 2010 the land transfer tax was amended to allow the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/germany-high-court-strikes-down-inheritance-tax-discrepancy-for-same-sex-partners.php">same benefits</a> [JURIST report] as heterosexual couples for same-sex couples in case of a divorce.

According to the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=4161cd66-5e41-4d4e-a98f-9cc1ddbcec91">official summary</a> [text, PDF], "While the NDAA mandates the designation of a senior [Defense Department] official to facilitate the safe transfer of detainees overseas, the NDAA also maintains the bi-partisan prohibition against transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay." The bill allocates over 200 million dollars to restore dilapidated facilities, as well as improve staff facilities. The bill also includes efforts to address the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+sexual+assault">sexual assault crisis in the military</a> [JURIST news archive], as well as a plethora of other defense initiatives ranging from retirement compensation to funding for drones.

The statement came as concern over increased convictions of international NGO personnel mounts. Ban reiterated the UN's commitment to helping the Egyptian government and its people through a successful democratic transition. Following the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder], Egypt's legislature has been unstable. The bodies continue to pass draft laws in an attempt to stabilize the transition. This statement calls for the government to keep human rights concerns in mind when taking such action.

The statement does not directly comment on the matter, as it was made in response to a pending lawsuit in New Mexico brought by a same-sex couple. In a <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MTY5ODY5Njc0MjQyOTUzODAxNDYBMDM2NjM5MTcwMzAxNTQ2MDA2MDABclYxRm1FQU9IYTBKATQBbm1hZy5nb3YBdjI">policy memo</a> [text] released by King's office as part of extensive research, King stated his office would not give an official ruling and would instead defer to the court system. King analyzes New Mexico and national laws surrounding the challenge. The memo states:<blockquote>Although current state statutes limit marriage to couples of the opposite sex, we believe they are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. ... We believe it likely that a New Mexico court would apply intermediate scrutiny to this state's laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. If so, based on the cases in other states that have applied intermediate scrutiny to similar laws in their states, there appears to be little possibility that New Mexico's laws precluding same-sex marriage would withstand an equal protection challenge.</blockquote>There are <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Gay-marriage-dispute-pending-in-New-Mexico-4581910.php">three lawsuits</a> [AP report] challenging New Mexico laws. One was filed Thursday and two others were filed in March to try to compel court clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It is this practice that King refused to compel, given the pending nature of these claims.

<p>The issue of <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains controversial in the US. In May the Minnesota House <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> a same-sex marriage bill which was later <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/minnesota-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] by the governor. Earlier that week Delaware's governor <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill into law. That same month Rhode Island's governor also <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/rhode-island-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex marriage bill into law. In March the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two same-sex marriage cases. The first case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-proposition-8-case.php">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [JURIST report], examines the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In the second case, <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-doma.php">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST report], the court examines the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the two cases in December. Both cases could have an important impact on the ongoing same-sex marriage controversy in the US. A ruling is expected later this month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://adcmemorial.org/www/category/about-us/the-anti-discrimination-centre-adc-memorial?lang=en">Anti-Discrimination Centre Memorial</a> in St. Petersburg and the <a href="http://eng.publicverdict.ru/">Public Verdict Foundation</a> [advocacy websites] in Moscow allegedly violated Russian law when they <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13417&LangID=E">gave evidence</a> [UN press release] to the UN Committee. The law requires NGOs and <a href="/dateline/2013/05/shubin-nikita-russian-law.php">non-commercial organizations</a> (NCOs) [JURIST op-ed] to register as foreign agents if they engage in any political activity or receive foreign funding. Committee against Torture Chairperson Claudio Grossman and the Committee's Rapporteur on Reprisals George Tugushi wrote Russia's UN ambassador seeking reassurance that no NGO would be targeted for their "legitimate activities." 

<p>Russia's human rights record has come under fire recently, particularly the foreign agents law adopted last November. The UN had previously condemned the law's "obstructive, intimidating and stigmatizing effects" on the country's NGOs and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-experts-urge-russia-to-revise-law-detrimental-to-ngos.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Russia to revise the law to comply with international standards. Critics have argued that <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] is taking steps backwards toward a more restrictive government, claiming the foreign agents law is curbing free speech and allows the government to severely penalize the works of NGOs. Last month, in addition to concern over the law, the EU also <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/eu-concerned-over-russia-human-rights-record.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Russia to refrain from adopting legislation on "homosexual propaganda," which the EU believes could "increase discrimination and violence against LGBTI individuals." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmarijuana.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Governor Peter Shumlin</a> [official website] signed a <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2014/bills/intro/H-200.pdf">bill</a> [H.200, PDF] on Thursday decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Vermont became the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/06/us-usa-marijuana-vermont-idUSBRE95517H20130606">seventeenth state in the US</a> [Reuters report] to decriminalize marijuana, adding to a growing trend of more lenient drug laws and regulations. Under the new legislation possession of less than one ounce of marijuana (28.3 grams) would be treated as a civil penalty, replacing jail time with a fine similar to one for a traffic ticket. Additionally anyone under the age of 21 caught with small amounts of marijuana would be treated the same as if they were in possession of alcohol. Upon signing the bill Shumlin emphasized the importance of <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/gov-shumlin-signs-marijuana-decriminalization">shifting state resources</a> [press release] from drugs such as marijuana to more addictive and harmful opiates like heroin and meth. 

<p>Earlier this week the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-reports-finds-racial-disparities-in-marijuana-possession-arrest-rates.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that black people were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people, concluding that such statistics illustrated a racial bias as well as the failure of narcotics law and public policy. In May the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the <a href="http://courts.mi.gov/courts/michigansupremecourt/pages/default.aspx">Michigan Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">private sale of medical marijuana is illegal</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge ruled that the state's <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">medical marijuana law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open. On the far end of the spectrum Washington and Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized marijuana</a> [JURIST report] via state ballot initiatives during the November 2012 election cycle, while Massachusetts also approved the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legalization of medical marijuana</a> [Harvard Crimson report] through a similar referendum. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Their report further asserted that the government's stringent restrictions on dissent will give it cause to refuse licenses to those high-traffic organizations that do not conform to its limitations on published material. Despite the government's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MDASingapore">public stance</a> [Facebook page] that each case will be evaluated on its individual merits, HRW posed concerns that these requirements violate the <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=CompId%3Afadfb638-9566-417c-ae6b-b68384ce5834;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fsearch%2Fsummary%2Fresults.w3p%3Bpage%3D0%3Bquery%3DCompId%253Afadfb638-9566-417c-ae6b-b68384ce5834">Singapore constitution</a> and <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (article 19)</a> [text, PDF] in a manner consistent with <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.27_en.pdf">previous concerns</a> [official report, PDF] posed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">UN Special Reporter on Human Rights</a> [official website] regarding Internet censorship.

<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=free+speech">Freedom of speech</a> [JURIST news archive] has been an international concern in recent months. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] and HRW in April <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/rights-groups-criticize-russia-laws-restricting-free-speech.php">criticized Russia</a> [JURIST report] for limiting freedom of speech since <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile] returned to the presidency. Such laws are similar to those that are raising suspicion in Singapore, although freedom of speech is not the only human rights concern there. Last month, Singapore also <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/singapore-high-court-upholds-ban-on-male-same-sex-intercourse.php">outlawed same-sex intercourse</a> [JURIST report].

Section 337A outlaws intercourse between men in both public and private settings, and imposes punishments of up to two years in prison.

Opposition leader Kem Sokha also allegedly said that exhibits at the genocide museum were faked. Hun Sen's comments come ahead of the national election set for July 28, which he is expected to win in a landslide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government laid out its arguments limiting the scope of the case in the reply brief filed in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-labor-relations-board-v-noel-canning/">National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] in which the lower court ruled such appointments were unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is set to decide if it will accept the government's petition to review the decision. Noel Canning contends that the court should review if the Senate's pro forma sessions held last January prevented it from being in recess. The government's reply brief claims:<blockquote>The effect of the Senate's pro-forma sessions on the length of its recess was the principal question addressed by the parties in the court of appeals, ... and it is assuredly important. But that question was not resolved by the court of appeals, and it has not yet been resolved by any court, though it might be a ground of decision in any of several cases that are currently pending in the courts of appeals.</blockquote>Because the issue was not addressed in the lower court, the government contends it should not be addressed in the Supreme Court's review.

<p>The <em>writ of certiorari</em> was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/obama-petitions-supreme-court-on-recess-appointments.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in April. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the recess appointment of three members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by President Barack Obama was unconstitutional. The case was brought by a bottler and distributor of Pepsi-Cola products in Washington state challenging the NLRB after the Board affirmed a decision that the distributor violated the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text]. In addition, two business advocacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/two-business-groups-challenge-obamas-recess-appointments.php">filed motions</a> contesting the constitutionality of the president's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/doj-defends-obamas-recess-appointments.php">recess appointments</a> [JURIST reports] in January 2012. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] defended the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BP\W%3B%20P%20%20%0A">use of recess appointments</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] by Obama immediately after his announcement. The DOJ's memo argues that although the Senate met between January 3 and 23, the sessions were not sufficient to constitute an interruption of a recess under the Recess Appointment Clause because they were only pro forma sessions that lasted less than a minute and there was no intent to conduct any business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While Emmerson's office recently released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13355&LangID=E">statement</a> [text] strongly in favor of the new policies laid out in a speech by US President Barack Obama, this statement reiterates the need for more clarity and specificity in the administration's policies. Specifically, Emmerson is calling for more information surrounding the drone policies be released into the public domain. The statement comes after Emmerson finished a fact-finding mission in the administration where Emmerson met with lawyers at the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency and the President's National Security Staff. 

<p>The statement comes in reference to a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">speech</a> [JURIST report] Obama gave in May. The Obama administration's counterterrorism projects have been highly criticized. In April Pakistan declared US <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-declares-drone-strikes-illegal-directs-foreign-ministry-to-introduce-resolution-in-un.php">drone strikes are illegal</a> [JURIST report] and directed Pakistan's <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] to introduce a resolution against such attacks in the UN. Also in April JURIST Guest Columnist David Frakt of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law argued that the Obama administration should <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">release those detainees</a> [JURIST op-ed] held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US. Also last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for US authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-calls-for-guantanamo-prison-closure.php">close down the Guantanamo prison camp</a> [JURIST report], emphasizing the continued indefinite incarcerations of many detainees as a clear violation of international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sharif's comments came hours after a drone strike in North Waziristan <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18218238">killed several people</a> [BBC report]. Sharif, who was sworn into office two days ago, communicated that <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/08/189817233/pakistans-new-government-protests-u-s-drone-strike">Pakistan disapproves</a> [NPR report] of the drone strikes and considers them a violation of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Sharif stated it is crucial to create a joint strategy to prevent US drone strikes. 

<p>The use of drone strikes by the US has come under attack recently. Last month Chief Justice Dost Muhammad Khan of the High Court of Peshawar in Pakistan ruled that US drone strikes in the region are <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/pakistan-court-declares-drone-strikes-illegal-directs-foreign-ministry-to-introduce-resolution-in-un.php">illegal</a> [JURIST report].

Also in March US Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/holder-drone-strikes-on-us-soil-legal-in-extraordinary-circumstances.php">wrote a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Senator Rand Paul suggesting that a drone strike on US soil would be legal only in extraordinary circumstances, following a lengthy filibuster by the senator in the confirmation of John Brennan as CIA director.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontchinaflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Chinese court in Huairou on Sunday sentenced Liu Hui, brother-in-law of the Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], to 11 years in prison on charges of fraud. The verdict is seen by many as severe and is widely believed to be an act of political persecution and <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/2013/06/09/court-years-for-jailed-nobel-winner-relative/2xwRIhJ6PfhfLCJ2v9JT7N/story.html">retaliation</a> [AP report] for allegedly subversive activities by the Liu family against the Chinese government. Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010, is currently serving an <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] for "inciting subversion of state power" and dissidence. Police in China <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/china-authorities-arrest-brother-in-law-of-nobel-winner-liu-xiaobo.php">arrested and detained</a> [JURIST report] Liu Hui in March on charges of fraud, formally charging him in a real estate dispute. Liu Xia, the wife of Liu Xiaobo and sister of Liu Hui, was under house arrest in December but secretly enabled news reporters and family friends to sneak past security guards who were watching her house. Many are also viewing the severity of the ruling against Liu Hui as a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/world/asia/china-sentences-brother-in-law-of-nobel-laureate-to-prison.html">message</a> [NYT report] that China intends to stand strong against Western pressure for greater human rights. 

<p>Liu Xiaobo has been one of China's most prominent dissidents. He spent two years in prison following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] uprising, has long challenged China's one-party rule and co-authored <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/content/238">Charter 08</a> [text], a petition calling for political reforms in the country. International organizations have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/rights-groups-call-for-china-to-release-nobel-winner-liu.php">rallying for Liu's release</a> since he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</a> [JURIST reports] in November 2010. In August 2011 the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Liu, according to UN documents obtained by Freedom Now. The documents said that the Chinese government responded by saying the conviction was in accordance with Chinese criminal codes and consistent with the rule of law.

US District Court Judge Richard Roberts <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/jud/ciel022912.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] last year that the document should be released to the <a href="http://www.ciel.org/">Center for International Environmental Law</a> (CIEL) [official website], finding that there was no reason to justify withholding it. The appeals court, however, reversed the order and gave deference to the USTR's judgment after determining that forcing disclosure of the classified position paper "could limit the flexibility of U.S. negotiators" in the future. 

<p>US Courts have dealt with many FOIA cases recently, on both state and federal levels. In April the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled unanimously in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-17_d1o2.pdf">McBurney v.

The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in March <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-appeals-court-judge-reverses-ruling-on-cia-drone-records.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling which allowed the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">CIA</a> [official website] to refuse to confirm or deny whether it has records pertaining to the use of unmanned drones to kill suspected terrorists. The case arose from a FOIA claim filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] requesting records on the CIA's drone program regarding the legal justification for using drones and information concerning civilian casualties. In March 2011, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-rules-against-government-in-freedom-of-information-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 8-1 in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1163">Milner v.

This case <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-freedom-of-information-act.php">originated</a> [JURIST report] when petitioner Glen Scott Milner filed an FOIA request with a US Navy magazine relating to the explosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) of explosives stored in a naval magazine near Milner's home. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The estimated number of detainees is more than 80. Karzai's spokesperson, Aimal Faizi, <a href="http://president.gov.af/en/news/21162">confirmed</a> [press release] that Karzai instructed <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/spanta.html">National Security Advisor Rangin Dadfar Spanta</a> [Afghanistan Online profile] to ask the British Embassy in Kabul to hand over the prisoners by June 22. The British embassy responded that while it supports the transfer of custody, it needs assurances that doing so would not result in a violation of British laws against torture. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/06/02/bagram-detainee-review-boards-better-still-falling-short">cautioned</a> [press release] against the transfer of detainees. Faizi responded that, "Continuing the detention of Afghan nationals by the British forces will be a violation of our national sovereignty and our country's laws."

<p>London-based <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/news_details.php?id=311">Public Interest Lawyers</a> [firm website] last month <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/uk-forces-accused-of-illegally-detaining-afghans-at-camp-bastion.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the UK military of holding at least eight men without charge at the UK temporary holding facility in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Their clients were allegedly held for over eight months without charge and without access to lawyers in what could be a breach of international law. Applications for <em>habeas corpus</em> were issued on behalf of two of the men in April, and the military ordered a hearing set in July. According to the UK <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defense</a> [official website], the detainees are being held in Camp Bastion until a safe path through the Afghan system could be assured. Last year an Afghan detainee who was handed over to authorities in Afghanistan by UK forces won permission to challenge the legality of the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-permits-afghan-detainee-to-challenge-legality-of-transfer.php">transfer</a> [JURIST report] in a UK court. Before the High Court of Justice in London, Serdar Mohammed claimed that he had been transferred by British forces to a prison in Afghanistan where he was tortured by the Afghanistan intelligence service until he confessed that he was a member of the Taliban. The court felt there was "an arguable case" that required being heard out by a jury in order to determine the legality of the transfer. Observing the potential for torture, British forces have temporarily halted any future transfer of detainees to Afghanistan. Following the policy shift, a Ministry of Defense spokesperson claimed that UK does not transfer detainees to facilities where there is a risk of torture. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Department of Agriculture</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to review petitioners' takings claim. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (AMAA) and the California Raisin Marketing Order require raisin growers to turn over a percentage of their crop to the federal government to stabilize prices. Petitioners, a group of California raisin growers, refused to turn over their crops and sought judicial review of fines imposed by the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website], claiming a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] violation. The Ninth Circuit held that petitioners were required to bring their takings claim in the Court of Federal Claims and that it therefore lacked jurisdiction to review petitioners' claim. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court disagreed: "Petitioners' takings claim, raised as an affirmative defense to the agency's enforcement action, was properly before the court because the AMAA provides a comprehensive remedial scheme that withdraws Tucker Act jurisdiction over takings claims brought by raisin handlers." The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-raisins-takings-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. The court ruled in another takings clause case earlier this term. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-597_i426.pdf">Arkansas Game &#38; Fish Commission v.

Sutter</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that an arbitrator did not exceed his powers under &#167;10(a)(4) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] when he found that the parties' contract provided for class arbitration. Respondent John Sutter, a pediatrician, entered into a contract with petitioner Oxford Health Plans, a health insurance company. When Sutter brought suit against Oxford on behalf of himself and several others, Oxford moved to compel arbitration of Sutter's individual claims. The parties agreed that the arbitrator should decide whether their contract authorized class arbitration, and he determined that it did. Oxford moved to vacate the arbitrator's decision, arguing that he had exceeded his authority under &#167;10(a)(4). In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court disagreed:<blockquote>In sum, Oxford chose arbitration, and it must now live with that choice. Oxford agreed with Sutter that an arbitrator should determine what their contract meant, including whether its terms approved class arbitration. The arbitrator did what the parties requested: He provided an interpretation of the contract resolving that disputed issue. His interpretation went against Oxford, maybe mistakenly so. But still, Oxford does not get to rerun the matter in a court. Under &#167;10(a)(4), the question for a judge is not whether the arbitrator construed the parties' contract correctly, but whether he construed it at all. Because he did, and therefore did not "exceed his powers," we cannot give Oxford the relief it wants.</blockquote>The ruling affirms the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10457253575316827915&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">decision</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-forced-arbitration-clauses.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. Oxford had argued that the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in  <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=+Stolt-Nielsen+S.A.+v.+Animalfeeds+Int%27l+Corp.,&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39&amp;case=7084067900530012192&amp;scilh=0">Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. Animalfeeds Int'l Corp.</a> [opinion] required the court to vacate the award authorizing class arbitration. In <span class="casename">Stolt-Nielson</span> the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-class-arbitration.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that that imposing class arbitration on parties when that issue is silent in the parties' arbitration clauses is inconsistent with the FAA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">came forward</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] on Sunday as the whistleblower in the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] surveillance scandal. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy. Congressman <a href="http://peteking.house.gov/">Peter King</a> (R-NY) [official website] is now <a href="http://peteking.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/collection-of-verizons-phone-records-touches-off-fierce-debate-about">calling</a> [press release] for the arrest of Snowden, who is now seeking asylum in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Senator <a href="http://www.markudall.senate.gov/?p=blog&id=3439">Mark Udall</a> (D-CO) [official website] is calling for lawmakers to amend the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/what_is_the_patriot_act.pdf">Patriot Act of 2001</a> [DOJ backgrounder], which is one of the statutes that empowered the NSA to take these measures. 

<p>On Wednesday of last week, <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">published</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order">top secret order</a> [text] authorizing the NSA to collect data from Verizon customers, regardless of whether they were suspected of wrongdoing. The court order, granted by the <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [Federal Judiciary Center backgrounder] to the FBI in April, required Verizon to turn over information about phone calls between the US and foreign countries and phone calls within the US. The order compels the production of metadata, including location, time and call duration, but does not include content of calls. The order is set to expire July 19. Also last week a secret program known as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/">Prism</a> [WP report] was revealed, which has reportedly given the government access to data from companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that there is an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">ex post facto</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] violation when a defendant is sentenced under <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/index.cfm">US Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials] promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense. The petitioner in the case, Marvin Peugh, argued that the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit erred when it <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8621445837880918384&q=United+States+v.+Peugh,+675+F.3d+736+%287th+Cir.+2012%29&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">used</a> [opinion] the 2009 sentencing guidelines rather than the guidelines that were in place in 1998, the year he committed the crime in question. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court: <blockquote>The arguments put forward by the Government and the dissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh's case falls within <em>Calder</em>'s third category of <em>ex post facto</em> violations. "[T]he <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause forbids the [government] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering the substantive 'formula' used to calculate the applicable sentencing range." ... That is precisely what the amended Guidelines did here. Doing so created a "significant risk" of a higher sentence for Peugh ... and offended "one of the principal interests that the <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause was designed to serve, fundamental justice."</blockquote>The ruling reversed the Seventh Circuit's decision, resolving a circuit split.

<p>Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan joined the opinion in full. Justice Anthony Kennedy joined except as to Part III-C, which discussed how the holding "is consistent with basic principles of fairness that animate the <em>Ex Post Facto</em> Clause." Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito as to Parts I and II-C. Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Antonin Scalia joined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With a mind towards reduce the costs of legal aid, on April 9 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/chris-grayling">Secretary Chris Grayling</a> [official profile] <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/making-legal-aid-fairer-for-taxpayers--2">announced</a> [press release] a series of proposals which would cut upwards of &#163;220 million from the &#163;2.2 billion legal aid budget. The CCRC <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/legal-aid-changes-will-lead-to-convictions-of-innocent-8651454.html">expressed concerns</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] that the planned cuts could undermine the ability of lawyers to prevent miscarriages of justice and land the taxpayer with significant debt in trying to remedy them.

<p>Lawyers and legal organizations alike have responded critically to the proposed legal aid cuts. Last week the <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/">Law Society</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/law-society-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">described</a> [press release] the proposals as "unworkable," and likely to cause "catastrophic" damage to the UK's legal aid system. Also last week the <a href="http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/">Bar Council</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.barcouncil.org.uk/media-centre/news-and-press-releases/2013/june/bar-council-responds-to-legal-aid-consultation/">blistering criticism</a> [press release] of Grayling's proposals, claiming that the Ministry of Justice "failed to consider hard evidence" and that the proposals are "a breathtakingly convoluted way of finding ... savings." In a letter to <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/">The Times</a> [media website] on May 7, nine leading legal academics from six of the UK's top universities <a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/leading-academics-warn-legal-aid-cuts-could-have-devastating-effects/">set out their concerns</a> [press release] that the government's plan to cut criminal legal aid and introduce a system of tendering based on price could have devastating and irreversible consequences, making access to justice available only to those who can afford it and abandoning the professional lawyer-client relationship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/12-1298.Opinion.6-6-2013.1.PDF">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a suit against <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website] challenging its patents on genetically modified seeds. The suit was filed by farmers that have no desire to sow the genetically modified seeds as a preemptive action against Monsanto, which has a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=monsanto">lengthy history</a> [JURIST news archive] of bringing action against farmers who have sown Monsanto seeds without paying royalties. Monsanto, the world's largest seed company, has previously made "binding assurances" that it would not bring suit against farmers whose crops were inadvertently contaminated with trace amounts of Monsanto's genetically modified seeds. Writing for the three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Dyk stated:<blockquote>Monsanto's binding representations remove any risk of suit against the appellants as users or sellers of trace amounts (less than one percent) of modified seed. The appellants have alleged no concrete plans or activities to use or sell greater than trace amounts of modified seed, and accordingly fail to show any risk of suit on that basis.</blockquote>Affirming the lower court's ruling, the suit was dismissed for lack of controversy.

<p>The recent prevalence of genetically modified crops has been a point of contention in courts around the world. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-for-monsanto-in-seed-patent-dispute.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bowman-v-monsanto-co/">Bowman v. Monsanto</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a farmer who buys patented seeds may not reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission, even though the seeds are altered to self-replicate. In March 2011 the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ecj-legal-adviser-finds-ban-on-genetically-modified-crops-illegal.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that a ban on cultivating genetically modified crops is illegal after France attempted to prohibit the production of a strain of genetically modified maize developed by Monsanto in 2008. In December 2010 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-orders-destruction-of-genetically-engineered-plants.php">ordered the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of a crop of genetically engineered sugar beets due to its potential harmful effect on surrounding flora.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Huda Al-Ajmi was found guilty of three violations, including insulting the nation's ruler, <a href="http://www.da.gov.kw/eng/hhamir/hhamir.php">Emir Shaikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah</a> [official website], calling to overthrow the government and misusing her mobile phone. The 11-year prison term is the harshest sentence yet given to an online activist in Kuwait and will become final if it is not overturned when contested in the court of appeals and cassation court. Huda Al-Ajmi, who denies the charges, is not a well-known activist and is not known to have participated in opposition protests. 

<p>Recent political unrest in the region has caused the Kuwaiti government to <a href="http://news.kuwaittimes.net/woman-jailed-11-yrs-for-anti-amir-tweets-assembly-in-semi-paralysis-as-it-awaits-ruling/">clamp down</a> [<em>Kuwait Times</em> report] on online activists, with dozens of people serving sentences or awaiting trial on charges of insulting the Emir. In April Kuwati opposition leader Mussallam Al Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kuwait-opposition-leader-sentenced-to-5-years-for-criticizing-regime.php">sentenced</a> to five years after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kuwait-arrests-opposition-leader-for-negative-comments-against-regime.php">arrested</a> [JURIST reports] last October for criticizing the Emir in a public speech. Al Barrak was <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kuwait-opposition-leader-accused-of-criticizing-regime-released-on-bail.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] soon after his sentencing. Al Barrak's speech was made <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kuwait-opposition-leaders-criticize-government-challenge-to-election-law.php">during a boycott</a> [JURIST report] of a controversial election law <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/kuwait-constitutional-court-upholds-controversial-election-law.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] last September that some believe the incumbent party can use to redistrict the country to its own advantage.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

He has been held under house arrest at his Islamabad farmhouse since April 19. If Musharraf is also granted bail in his pending murder case, he will no longer be held under house arrest and will then be a free man. 

<p>Musharraf has recently been the subject of a host of legal troubles due to alleged unconstitutional and illegal actions that took place after he staged a military coup in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunionjack.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The High Court in London ruled Tuesday that the British government acted legally when it set up the <a href="http://www.chagos-trust.org">Chagos Conservation Trust</a> (CCT) [official website] in 2010 on the Indian Ocean archipelago of <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html">Chagos</a> [CIA backgrounder]. In 1965, the UK government severed the Chagos Islands from the colony of Mauritius just three years before freeing it from colonial rule in effect since 1814. The islands were subsequently deemed part of the British Indian Ocean Territory despite fervent protest from the Mauritian government, which alleged violations of a UN resolution prohibiting the severance of colonial settlements before independence. The UK government then oversaw the deportation of more than 1,500 <a href="http://www.chagossupport.org.uk/">Chagossians</a> [advocacy website] from the island of Diego Garcia, which was later leased to the US for use as a military base. After decades of controversy and litigation, the UK government moved to set up the CCT in 2010, which upon completion became the world's largest <a href="http://www.ukmpas.org">Marine Protected Area</a> (MPA) [government website]. Although many Chagossians relocated to the UK after gaining citizenship under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/8/contents">UK Overseas Territories Act of 2002</a> [text], many remained on the islands to fight the CCT, which allegedly precludes islanders from fishing in the area. In December the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website) ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the Chagossians' claims, thus clearing the way for UK jurisdiction. The High Court on Tuesday found the CCT congruent with EU law, but Chagossian groups have already expressed their intent to continue their fight against the UK government. 

<p>Litigation over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands has occurred for decades. In October 2008 the UK House of Lords <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/uk-law-lords-rule-against-chagos.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the British government acted within its power in denying the Chagossians the right to return to the archipelago. The group had challenged a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmfaff/501/501we16.htm">2004 order</a> [backgrounder] prohibiting permanent residence on the Chagos Islands, arguing that the government had abused its power by not acting in the best interest of the territory. In May 2007 the UK Court of Appeal had <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/uk-court-upholds-right-of-return-for.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of the islanders, and would have allowed them to resettle 65 islands in the archipelago, but not Diego Garcia itself. That decision upheld a 2006 High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-court-grants-right-of-return-for.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] granting the islanders the right to return, but both were overruled by the Law Lords' decision. Earlier that year, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/appeals-court-rejects-islanders-claim.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in a similar suit against the US Department of Defense that federal courts lacked the authority to grant compensation to the Chagossians for losses they incurred because of the development of the military base.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mtetwa was <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">arrested in March</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly interfering with a police search of her clients' office, but she contends that she was only asking the officers to produce a valid warrant. The arrest came just a day after the country voted in a constitutional referendum to increase protections against human rights violations. Human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] immediately <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/zimbabwe-must-immediately-release-prominent-human-rights-lawyer-2013-03-20">called the arrest unlawful</a> [press release]. The court later <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-court-denies-bail-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to Mtetwa after prosecutors argued that she may be a flight risk because she is a citizen of Swaziland. However, Zimbabwe's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zimbabwe-court-orders-immediate-release-of-detained-rights-laywer.php">ordered her immediate release</a> [JURIST report] in March, ruling that Mtetwa was following professional legal procedures when she demanded to see a search warrant. Mtetwa has stated that she believes her arrest was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/trial-begins-for-zimbabwes-top-rights-lawyer-state-alleges-improper-behavior/2013/06/10/741ea574-d1f7-11e2-9577-df9f1c3348f5_story.html">part of a ploy</a> [AP report] to intimidate human rights defenders prior to July elections.

<p>Zimbabwe has previously been criticized for its failure to ensure compliance with international human rights standards. In February three UN independent human rights experts urged the government of Zimbabwe to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/zimbabwe-urged-to-respect-human-rights-in-advance-of-constitutional-referendum.php">respect international human rights</a> [JURIST report] including privacy and freedom of association, in light of growing hostility toward civil society organizations. In the weeks leading up to the country's March 16 <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-president-pm-reach-agreement-on-new-constitution.php">constitutional referendum</a> [JURIST report], with a subsequent election to take place in July, "human rights experts have received increasing numbers of reports about acts of intimidation and harassment, physical violence and arrests against civil society actors, mostly working on human rights issues." In January Human Rights Watch said that the unity government, established in 2009 after the 2008 elections resulted in violence, had <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/zimbabwe-must-make-legal-reforms-for-2013-elections-hrw.php">failed to take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to ensure "credible, free and fair elections."</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a Verizon business network services customer, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-constitutionality-nsa-phone-spying-program">argues</a> [press release] that the program violates the rights of free speech and association as well as the right of privacy as protected by the First and Fourth Amendments.

They requested that the court provide a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/the-laws-behind-prism-how-we-got-here-and-what-we-can-do-to-get-back/276667/">statutory basis</a> [The Atlantic backgrounder, by Yale Clinic director] of its <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">recent controversial decisions</a> [JURIST report] to permit collection of civilians' personal data from private communication companies. Also Monday the first private suit challenging the surveillance was <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/146930457/PRISM-Class">filed</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] by <a href="http://www.larryklayman.com/">Larry Klayman</a> [personal website], the former chairman of <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/">Judicial Watch</a> [advocacy website], and a Philadelphia family who say the government has illegally spied on their private accounts.

<p>Although the president and top official have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">lawmakers have called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring.

Al-Hadi is an Iraqi prisoner who has been held at the <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detention center in Cuba since 2007. The official <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ChargingDocumentsAbdalHadialIraqi20131.pdf">charge sheet</a> [text, PDF] alleges, among other things, that al-Hadi was a superior commander for al Qaeda and that he and his operatives killed multiple US service members and attacked a US military medical helicopter with rocket-propelled grenades and firearms. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/11/us-usa-guantanamo-idUSBRE95A03C20130611">also allege</a> [Reuters report] that al-Hadi funded and oversaw all of al Qaeda's operations against US and allied forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2002 to 2004 and that he directed his forces to use various unlawful means, such as attacking civilians and detonating car bombs in civilian areas. The charges against Al-Hadi will next be reviewed by a Pentagon official. If approved, the case <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/06/10/guantanamo-iraqi-war-crimes-charges/2410439/">can proceed</a> [AP report] with arraignment on the charges, which carry a potential life sentence.

<p>There has recently been much debate regarding the possibility of closing the detention center in Cuba and moving the war crimes tribunals to a US location. Last week the House Armed Services Committee <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the 2014 <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF], which would keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open. The bill allocates over 200 million dollars to restore dilapidated facilities and to improve staff facilities. The bill was approved despite a speech given in May by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">outlined plans</a> [JURIST report] for closing Guantanamo Bay. In April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for US authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-calls-for-guantanamo-prison-closure.php">close down the Guantanamo prison camp</a> [JURIST report]. This request came after the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] and defense lawyers for detainees held in the prison camp <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/guantanamo-detainees-face-harsh-conditions-protests-include-hunger-strike-defense-lawyers.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Rear Admiral John Smith Jr. describing the harsh conditions faced by the detainees and also indicating that the detainees had begun to protest the conditions by <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-human-rights-attorneys-on.php">participating in a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ initially said it would <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-appeals-emergency-contraceptive-age-limit-restriction-lift.php">appeal the decision</a> [JURIST report], arguing the judge overstepped his authority. The FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm350230.htm">announced</a> [press release] after the district court decision that it would comply with over-the-counter sales, but still require proof of age for some forms of the pill. 

<p>The decision to drop the appeal comes just weeks after the Obama administration <a href="paperchase/2013/05/obama-administration-urges-review-of-plan-b-ruling.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the appeals court to delay implementation of the ruling. After the initial complaint filed by women's rights groups, the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/12/20111207a.html">Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website], <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Kathleen Sebelius</a> [HHS profile], intervened to block the ruling as it related to minors, citing inadequate evidence concerning adverse health effects. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Only <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/aclu-sues-heineman-over-immigrant-driver-s-licenses/article_6a077c40-25f0-5c12-bd8d-51d5332e21ba.html">Nebraska and Arizona</a> [<em>Lincoln Journal Star</em> report] have declined to allow illegal immigrants who qualify under DACA to receive driver's licenses, and Heineman's decision would block 1,400 illegal immigrants from obtaining licenses.

<p>This lawsuit is the most recent of those filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrants facing a variety of allegedly unconstitutional state immigration practices. Last week the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-us-deportation-practices.php">ACLU filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Los Angeles federal court alleging that undocumented immigrants were being coerced by Border Patrol and immigration officials into signing their own deportation documents and forfeiting their right to a fair trial. In December the ACLU filed a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/aclu-sues-arizona-governor-for-denying-drivers-licenses-to-illegal-immigrants.php">challenging an Arizona executive order</a> [JURIST report] that prevented certain immigrants from obtaining driver's licenses. In November the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-mandatory-immigrant-detention.php">on behalf of New Jersey immigrants</a> [JURIST report] that challenged the state's mandatory detention procedures. Earlier in 2012 the ACLU reported that certain immigrant detention centers in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/aclu-calls-for-immediate-remedy-of-arizona-immigrant-detention-conditions.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/aclu-criticizes-georgia-immigration-detention-centers.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports] were unsanitary, failed to give inmates proper access to medical treatment and denied inmates due process. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Oklahoma's standard vehicle license plates depict a sculpture of a Native American shooting an arrow toward the sky, "hoping the 'spirit world' or 'rain god' would answer the people's prayers for rain" during a drought. The suit was filed by an Oklahoma man whose "historic Christian beliefs" contradict the license plates speech. The court said, "The constitutional harm of compelled speech&#8212;'being forced to speak rather than to remain silent'&#8212;'occurs regardless of whether the speech is ideological.'" The judgment reversed and remanded the <a href="http://turtletalk.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dct-order-dismissing-cressman-complaint.pdf">dismissal</a> [opinion, PDF] of the lawsuit by the <a href="http://www.okwd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] .

<p>License plates have caused controversies regarding First Amendment rights. In January North Carolina announced a plan to appeal a ruling that found <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/north-carolina-to-appeal-ruling-against-choose-life-license-plates.php">"Choose Life" license plates</a> [JURIST report] unconstitutional. A permanent injunction to ban the production of the license plates was issued. Judge James Fox of the <a href="http://www.nced.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina</a> [official website] said "[t]he State's offering a 'Choose Life' license plate in the absence of a pro-choice alternative constitutes viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment." In 2008 a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Arizona residents should be able to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-arizona.php">purchase specialty license plates</a> [JURIST report] bearing the slogan "Choose Life." A week prior to that ruling a federal judge ruled that the state of Missouri cannot deny an anti-abortion group's application for a specialty license plate with an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-judge-rules-missouri-must-issue.php">anti-abortion message</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are 450 seats in the lower parliamentary house, and critics believe this is a move towards reinforcing a heteronormative society led by the <a href="https://mospat.ru/?lng=1">Russian Orthodox Church</a> [official website]. The bill would impose fines of nearly USD $140 on individuals, and about $31,000 on corporations. It must pass the upper house and be signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, but the bill is not expected to face any hurdles.

<p>Russian lawmakers <a href="paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced the bill</a> [JURIST report] in March. The proposed legislation called for fines of up to 500,000 rubles (USD $16,500) for promoting the homosexual lifestyle and appeared to be aimed at media outlets which lawmakers blamed for "promoting gay lifestyles as 'normal behavior.'" The proposal was immediately met with dismay by the UN and human rights groups. Earlier that month the City Hall of St. Petersburg in Russia announced that the city's governor <a href="paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a similar bill that would impose fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The St. Petersburg bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced in November 2011</a> [JURIST report], and sponsors claim it is necessary because homosexual propaganda "threatens" Russia and "sexual deviation" negatively impacts Russian children. Several advocacy groups challenged the bills as discriminatory. In January Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hrw-to-russia-reject-anti-gay-rights-bill.php">called on authorities to veto</a> [JURIST report] the Moscow legislation, which they called a "discriminatory and dangerous initiative." However, Russian legal scholars asserted that the Russian Constitution may allow limitations to be placed on the rights of homosexuals due to the constitutional ability to balance the interests of society and limit rights of a social group if they infringe upon the rights of another social group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Richard Matsch of the <a href="http://www.cod.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Colorado</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/11/us-usa-marijuana-colorado-idUSBRE95A19O20130611">ordered</a> [Reuters report] a permanent injunction against <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/LCS/Initiative%20Referendum/1112initrefr.nsf/c63bddd6b9678de787257799006bd391/cfa3bae60c8b4949872579c7006fa7ee/$FILE/Amendment%2064%20-%20Use%20&%20Regulation%20of%20Marijuana.pdf">Amendment 64</a> [text, PDF] which would have treated marijuana related magazines similarly to pornographic material. The ruling comes after magazine publishers and bookstores <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/144647197/Marijuana-Magazines-Complaint">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint] against the state last week. In response to the suit the <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/revenue">Colorado Department of Revenue</a> [official website] announced it would not enforce the rule. In addition, the <a href="http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/">Colorado Attorney General's Office</a> [official website] made an announcement that they would not to defend the rule, instead voicing agreement with the publishing companies that the provision was unconstitutional. 

<p>The sale and use of marijuana remains a controversial issue in the US and abroad. Last month Colorado <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/governor/">Governor John Hickenlooper</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/colorado-governor-signs-bills-regulating-recreational-marijuana.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a new set of laws regulating the use and sale of recreational marijuana. Earlier last month the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/california-supreme-court-upholds-local-ban-on-medical-marijuana-shops.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that local governments may outlaw medical marijuana dispensaries, upholding a ban enacted by the city of Riverside in 2010. In February the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/michigan-supreme-court-rules-that-private-sale-of-medical-marijuana-is-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the private sale of medical marijuana is illegal. Additionally, the top court in Ontario upheld Canada's <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/ontario-high-court-upholds-canada-ban-on-marijuana.php">general ban on marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. In December an Arizona judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/jurist-marijuana-jurist-news-archive.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's medical marijuana law is constitutional  and instructed the state to permit dispensaries to open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Quebec <a href="http://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/en/ministere/ministredel.php">Social Services Minister Veronique Hivon</a> [official profile] introduced the bill before the <a href="http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/abc-assemblee/assemblee-nationale/index.html">National Assembly</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/712492/bill52.pdf">proposed law</a> [Bill 52, PDF] provides special rules on the administration and consent requirements regarding medical aid to die for doctors, hospitals, hospice centers and other institutions that offer end of-life care. Medical aid to die as proposed by the bill differs from assisted suicide legal in four US states, where doctors are allowed to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs which the patient may take on there own. The proposed legislation would allow a doctor  to administer medication causing death after receiving the repeated consent of a patient. Euthanasia and assisted suicide <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/quebec-could-become-first-province-in-canada-with-right-to-die-law/2013/06/12/e7a4f3fe-d37d-11e2-b3a2-3bf5eb37b9d0_story.html">are illegal</a> [AP report] in Canada at the federal level.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world. The only European countries that allow assisted suicide are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Last month the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/europe-rights-court-rules-switzerland-laws-on-assisted-suicide-too-vague.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Swiss law does not provide sufficient guidelines on the extent of the right to die, in violation of Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. In April the Supreme Court of Ireland <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/ireland-high-court-rules-paralyzed-woman-has-no-right-to-assisted-suicide.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by a paralyzed woman seeking to allow her partner to help her commit suicide. Although Ireland decriminalized suicide in 1993, it is still a crime to assist another to commit suicide. In December a report released by the French government <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/france-report-recommends-permitting-doctors-to-accelerate-death-for-terminally-ill.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that the country permit doctors to "accelerate death" for terminally ill patients seeking doctor-assisted euthanasia. In August the High Court of England and Wales <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/uk-high-court-rules-against-paralyzed-man-in-right-to-die-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the plea of a paralyzed man challenging the legitimacy of the Suicide Act 1961 and other laws barring his ability to commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Enacted in 1949, the law served to protect the grounds from vandalism but also prohibited processions, parades and the display of banners supporting a particular cause or party, with violators risking a fine and up to 60 days in prison. Judge Beryl Howell found the 64-year-old law "unreasonable, substantially overbroad and irreconcilable with the First Amendment." As written, the <a href="http://jurist.justia.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt.cgi">law</a> [40 USC &#167; 6135] applies and provides criminal sanctions to any group parading or assembling, from peaceful protesters to a "line of preschool students from federal agency daycare centers, holding hands with chaperones, parading on the plaza on their first field trip to the Supreme Court." Howell also rejected the government's argument that the law preserved the appearance of the court as a body unswayed by external influences, stating:<blockquote>It is hard to imagine how tourists assembling on the plaza wearing t-shirts bearing their school's seal, for example, could possibly create the appearance of a judicial system vulnerable to outside pressure. While there may be a legitimate interest in protecting the decorum of the judiciary, the challenged statute is not a reasonable way to further that interest.</blockquote>Howell's order will apply only to the plaza of the Supreme Court. 

<p>The case was brought to the by Harold Hodge and the <a href="http://www.rutherford.org">Rutherford Institute</a> [advocacy website], after Hodge was arrested in January 2011 for wearing a sign protesting the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. The Rutherford institute applauded Howell's decision, <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/on_the_front_lines/victory_declaring_ban_repugnant_to_constitution_federal_court_affirms_first">stating</a> [press release] that the decision "throws a lifeline to the First Amendment at a time when government officials are doing their best to censor, silence and restrict free speech activities." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new treaty <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/2013/06/12/Jordan-MPS-approve-extradition-deal-with-Britain-.html">passed</a> [AFP report] with support from both houses of parliament, provides for mutual legal assistance between the two nations and can include any persons from each country. Last month Qatada indicated that he will <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2013/05/10/Abu-Qatada-will-go-to-Jordan-if-UK-treaty-ratified-says-lawyer.html">not challenge his deportation</a> [AFP report] if Jordan ratifies a treaty guaranteeing a fair trial. The deportation process of Qatada is expected to resume within weeks, once the treaty is signed into law by Jordan's King Abdullah.  

<p>Qatada, previously described as "Osama Bin Laden's right hand man in Europe," has been held in the UK for more than a decade since he was arrested in 2002 under the anti-terrorism act. In April the UK Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/uk-appeals-court-denies-governments-abu-qatada-appeal.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to allow the government to appeal to the Supreme Court an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-appeal-to-deport-radical-islamist-cleric-dismissed.php">decision not to deport</a> [JURIST reports] Qatada until a fair trial treaty has been ratified, fearing Qatada will be tortured upon his return to Jordan.

Myriad Genetics, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated. The court also found that synthetically created DNA known as complementary DNA (cDNA) is patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring.  <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website] patented two genes, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/brca">BRCA1 and BRCA2</a> [NCI backgrounder], which are linked to increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The two genes are isolated genes&#8212;different from native genes because the process of extracting them changes their molecular structure but not their genetic code. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court held that the isolated genes are not patentable, but that synthetic cDNA is patent eligible:<blockquote>cDNA does not present the same obstacles to patentability as naturally occurring, isolated DNA segments. ... Petitioners concede that cDNA differs from natural DNA in that "the non-coding regions have been removed." ... They nevertheless argue that cDNA is not patent eligible because "[t]he nucleotide sequence of cDNA is dictated by nature, not by the lab technician." ... That may be so, but the lab technician unquestionably creates something new when cDNA is made. cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, cDNA is not a "product of nature" and is patent eligible under &#167;101, except insofar as very short series of DNA may have no intervening introns to remove when creating cDNA. In that situation, a short strand of cDNA may be indistinguishable from natural DNA.</blockquote>The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-again-validates-cancer-gene-patents.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report] of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a separate short opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

<p>Gene patents remain a controversial issue around the world. In February the <a href="http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/">Federal Court of Australia</a> [official website] ruled that Myriad <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/australia-court-allows-us-company-to-patent-breast-cancer-gene.php">could patent the BRCA1 gene</a> [JURIST report] because the isolated gene is not natural, but rather the product of human intervention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Los Angeles</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that federal law preempts certain provisions of an agreement that trucking companies must sign before they can transport cargo at the Port of Los Angeles. In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the court held, "that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/14501">Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994</a> (FAAAA) [text] expressly preempts two of the contract's provisions, which require such a company to develop an off-street parking plan and display designated placards on its vehicles." The court declined to decide whether, under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18013303175480101883&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines, Inc.</a> (1954) [opinion], federal law governing licenses for interstate motor carriers prevents the Port from using the agreement's penalty clause to punish violations of other, non-preempted provisions. The court partially reversed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12672988338941437011&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">decision</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remanded the case. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-adoption-of-american-indian-baby-girl.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. An attorney for the <a href="http://www.trucking.org/">American Trucking Associations</a> [association website] argued that "[t]he Port is imposing binding standards of conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a channel of interstate commerce," impermissibly, through criminal penalties. An attorney for the city of Los Angeles argued that they were simply acting under the same standards as private entities. "They set forth conditions under which drayage trucks can enter the nonpublic portions of the Port, and they are indistinguishable, indistinguishable from contract provisions that private parties routinely impose on those who seek to enter their property. In our view, [49 USC &#167; 1450 (c)(1)] does not deal with contracts, and it doesn't deal with the right of landowners to condition those seeking entry into their Port."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Herrmann</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.owrb.ok.gov/rrccommission/rrccommission.html">Red River Compact</a> [materials] does not preempt Oklahoma water laws. The Red River Compact regulates water rights from the Red River among the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. Tarrant Regional Water District, a Texas agency, claimed that it was entitled to divert water from within Oklahoma because the compact preempts Oklahoma statutes that restrict such diversions. Alternatively, Tarrant argued that the Oklahoma laws were unconstitutional restrictions on interstate commerce. In an opinion by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court held that Tarrant's claims lack merit: "The Red River Compact does not pre-empt Oklahoma's water statutes because the Compact creates no cross-border rights in its signatories for these statutes to infringe. Nor do Oklahoma's laws run afoul of the Commerce Clause." The court affirmed the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14230952523000160341&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">ruling</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

The attorney for Tarrant argued that the Red River Compact clearly allowed Texas to use the Red River as it saw fit, and "Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain." An attorney for Rudolf John Herrmann, representing the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, stated that through a strip called Shawnee Creek, all of the Red River in Texas, and Lake Texoma, "Texas users draw water, quite a lot of water," and thus should not need to dip into Oklahoma territory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Davila</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that judicial participation in plea negotiations does not automatically require vacatur of a defendant's guilty plea. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_11">11(c)(1)</a> [text] provides that "[t]he court must not participate in [plea] discussions." Rule 11(h) states: "A variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights." Anthony Davila was charged with filing more than 130 false tax returns in the name of Florida inmates. He pleaded guilty after being advised by the judge that it was his best course of action. In an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court held that this violation of Rule 11(c)(1) did not require automatic vacatur of the guilty plea because Rule 11(h) is controlling. The court vacated the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6506093038891259231&q=United+States+v.+Davila,+664+F.3d+1355&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">decision</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and remanded for further proceedings. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a separate opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

<p>At <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-gene-patent-case.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in April, some of the justices expressed concern that if Rule 11(c)(1) were applied maximally, then minor actions of the judge could be used as an argument that the judge was influencing the negotiations and therefore be a basis for voiding a guilty plea. Counsel for the US argued that significant violations of Rule 11(c)(1), such as a judge pressuring the government outside of the defendant's presence to offer a plea, must be distinguished from minor violations, such as a judge indicating too strongly what type of new plea deal he would be willing to accept after rejecting the initial plea deal. Counsel for the US further argued that applying the rule too rigidly would trap judges in a corner where they couldn't guard against later ineffective assistance of counsel claims by discussing plea deals with the defendants because it would risk automatic reversal as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation. Counsel for Davila argued that this was not a trivial matter and that the judge had "abandoned his role as neutral arbiter and fundamentally distorted the pretrial process." Because of the judge's unique position as a alleged neutral arbiter, any influence that he has on the plea negotiation process is magnified and it puts an incredible amount of pressure on defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an effort to comply with the judge's April <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], the FDA has approved the brand name version of <a href="http://planbonestep.com/?MTD=2&CPN=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=plan%20b%20one%20step&utm_campaign=Branded&gclid=CMb1uqHf4bcCFfRQOgod1nAA0g">Plan-B OneStep</a> [product website] for women of all ages without retail restrictions. However, opposing parties <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/response-to-FDA-on-Plan-B-6-12-13.pdf">argued</a> [letter, PDF] Wednesday that limiting the approval to the one-step version of the brand name hormone would increase pricing, thus limiting availability to women of lesser means. While Korman agreed that such a spike in price was theoretically possible, he maintained that the FDA has only to approve the same hormone produced by generic pharmaceutical companies in order to avoid the problem. He expressed a firm belief that the FDA would do so as quickly as possible. As for the two-pill alternative, the judge emphasized that making the two-pill option as readily available as its alternative was in the discretion of the FDA. On the other hand, the language of the ruling reiterated the court's dismay at the FDA's "unjustifiably political" history of restricting access to the drugs, evincing the judge's <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/resistance-on-plan-b/">longstanding conviction</a> [SCOTUSblog report] that access to emergency contraceptives should be as least-restrictive as possible.

<p>In 2005 organizations and individuals concerned with women's health filed suit in the Eastern District of New York, in pursuit of expanded access to the drugs, including over-the-counter availability regardless of age. It was heard before Korman, who ruled in their favor, but in December 2011 the Secretary of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website], <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Kathleen Sebelius</a> [HHS profile], intervened to block the ruling as it related to minors, citing inadequate evidence concerning adverse health effects. In April Korman overruled Sebelius' "unprecedented," decision, calling the prior requirement for adolescents under age 16 "unjustified and burdensome." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] initially <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/doj-appeals-emergency-contraceptive-age-limit-restriction-lift.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the decision in, stating that the judge had overstepped his legal authority. The DOJ announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/doj-drops-appeal-of-plan-b-contraceptive-ruling.php">drop the appeal</a> [JURIST report] on Monday. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the UN's data specialists, this estimate represents only recorded deaths where the name, location and date of death were reported. For those casualties lacking one or more identifying values, the information was excluded from the data set. The casualties were sourced from eight different reports, and potential duplicates were eliminated. Thus, the actual number of deaths is far greater than 93,000, but only that many have been recorded. Additionally, most of the casualties are not expected to be members of any armed organization. Pillay said:<blockquote>This extremely high rate of killings, month after month, reflects the drastically deteriorating pattern of the conflict over the past year. ... As clearly indicated in the latest report by the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, civilians are bearing the brunt of widespread, violent and often indiscriminate attacks which are devastating whole swathes of major towns and cities, as well as outlying villages.</blockquote>As time and the conflict continues, the UN will do its best to improve its records. 

<p>Last Tuesday a panel of UN human rights experts issued their latest <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A-HRC-23-58_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on the conflict, <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-report-war-crimes-escalating-in-syria.php">detailing escalating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed by both sides. Both France and the US have claimed to have found evidence regarding the limited use of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/25/world/meast/syria-civil-war">Sarin</a> [CNN report], a toxic gas, but it is not clear which side was using it in the conflict. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of <a href="http://www.presidentassad.net/">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</a> [official website]. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] released a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp">statement</a> [text] two weeks ago on the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-secretary-general-calls-for-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">condemning the most recent violence</a> [JURIST report] in Syria, and expressing concern over how it has been affecting the civilian population. Two weeks ago Navi Pillay condemned the recent violence in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/X85DB">Qusayr</a> [map] and <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-tangible-action-in-syria.php">criticized</a> [JURIST reports] the broader human rights violations taking place in Syria. In May Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-internationl-action-in-syria.php">called for international action</a> [JURIST report] after a series of massacres were carried out against Syrian civilians. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] condemned the Syrian Air Force for <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/hrw-condemns-aerial-attacks-in-syria.php">deliberately targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report] in air strikes in rebel-controlled areas. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-against-civilians-hrw.php">accused Syria's military</a> [JURIST report] of using widely-banned cluster bombs against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Klayman, founder of the political advocacy group <a href="http://www.freedomwatchusa.org/">Freedom Watch</a> [advocacy website], claims the surveillance practices violate citizens' reasonable expectation of privacy, their rights to free speech and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, due process rights, as well as certain common law claims. The complaint names the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA), the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites], US President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and 12 communications and Internet companies as defendants and seeks $23 billion in damages.

<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed a similar suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA. Klayman filed the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/146930457/PRISM-Class">first private suit</a> [text, PDF] the day prior, in a separate lawsuit against Verizon and the Obama administration, requesting the same orders as his second suit in addition to $3 billion in damages. Although the president and top officials have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">lawmakers have called</a> [JURIST report] for a review of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">came forward</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] on Sunday as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy. <a href="http://peteking.house.gov/">Congressman Peter King</a> (R-NY) [official website] <a href="http://peteking.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/collection-of-verizons-phone-records-touches-off-fierce-debate-about">called</a> [press release] for the arrest of Snowden, who is now seeking asylum and is allegedly missing in Hong Kong.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In order to "maintain suitable order and decorum within the Supreme Court building and grounds," the Court passed the new regulation in reaction to a <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Hodge-ruling.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by Judge Beryl Howell that the statute banning public displays was unconstitutional and void as applied to the Supreme Court plaza. In <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-law-prohibiting-demonstrations-on-supreme-court-plaza.php">striking down the statute</a> [JURIST report], Howell called the legislation passed by Congress in 1949 "unreasonable" and "substantially overbroad." 

<p>The case was brought to the by Harold Hodge and the <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/">Rutherford Institute</a> [advocacy website] after Hodge was arrested in January 2011 for wearing a sign protesting the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. The Rutherford institute applauded Howell's decision, <a href="https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/on_the_front_lines/victory_declaring_ban_repugnant_to_constitution_federal_court_affirms_first">stating</a> [press release] that the decision "throws a lifeline to the First Amendment at a time when government officials are doing their best to censor, silence and restrict free speech activities." The former law read: "It is unlawful to parade, stand, or move in processions or assemblages in the Supreme Court Building or grounds, or to display in the Building and grounds a flag, banner, or device designed or adapted to bring into public notice a party, organization, or movement." The Court itself previously <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Grace_461_US_171_103_S_Ct_1702_75_L_Ed_2d_736_198">ruled</a> [opinion] on the constitutionality of the law governing protests or demonstrations at or near its building in a 1983 case, <span class="casename">United States v. Grace</span>. The justices then nullified only the law's ban on displays on the public sidewalks around the court building, refusing to strike down the entire law as written. The former law allowed the court's police force discretion to allow only two kinds of activity on its plaza: television crew interviews on days the court had held hearings, and taking photographs for commercial or professional purposes with the court's permission.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013">North Dakota House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-house-approves-fetal-pain-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill the Friday before, and it was approved by the North Dakota Senate in February. In March Judge Lynn Winmill of the <a href="http://www.id.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/federal-judge-overturns-idaho-abortion-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Idaho's "fetal pain" statute, which banned most abortions after 20 weeks. Winmill struck down the law as placing an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion and as unconstitutionally vague in its criminal sanctions. In April 2011 Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed into law</a> two pieces of legislation restricting abortions in the state: the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF], which requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed; and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF], which restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/13/uk-zimbabwe-elections-idUKBRE95C09V20130613">amended electoral laws</a> [Reuters report] ensure that all political parties have access to the state broadcaster and that the results of elections will be posted outside polling centers, and the long-awaited poll date was officially set for July 31. However, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6439617.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morgan+tsvangirai">news archive</a>] promptly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/13/mugabe-elections-zimbabwe-tsvangirai-constitution">declared</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] Mugabe's action to be a "unilateral and flagrant breach of our constitution and the GPA [global political agreement]," which states that the president could only act in consultation with the prime minister in announcing election dates. Tsvangirai also alleges that Mugabe infringed on the voter-registration process, disenfranchising first-time voters and denying political parties and Zimbabweans the chance to inspect the much-criticized voters roll.

<p>In May, Zimbabwe's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/zimbabwe-constitutional-court-orders-elections-by-end-of-july.php">imposed</a> [JURIST report] a July 31 election deadline and ordered Mugabe to announce a date soon. The order came just one week after Mugabe <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/zimbabwe-president-signs-constitution-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the country's <a href="http://www.copac.org.zw/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=7&Itemid=154">new constitution</a> [text] into law. Mugabe, 89, has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence from the UK in 1980. After the country's disputed elections in 2008, Mugabe and his political rival Tsvangirai formed a coalition government and found a compromise to hold elections on the condition that a new constitution was enacted beforehand. Zimbabwe has been criticized for the state of its legislative and electoral environment. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/zimbabwe0113webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] issued by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], the organization said that the country must take adequate steps to ensure "credible, free and fair elections" in 2013.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hun Sen announced on Monday that the program will be suspended until after the country's national elections. HRW Asia Director Brad Adams stated that, while it is good that the program is being suspended, the suspension "demonstrates just how political the effort has been from the outset." Hun Sen has defended the program as an effort to provide documentation to 478,928 families to 1.8 million square meters of land. Adams, however, claims that it has in reality "amounted to a land grab by powerful interests" and that the "campaign is being conducted in a secretive and bullying manner." The national elections will be held on July 28.

<p>Human rights groups have criticized Cambodia for corruption and human rights violations in various areas of its government in recent years. In March HRW accused Cambodia of <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/cambodias-judicial-system-criticized-by-rights-organizations.php">misusing its judicial system</a> [JURIST report] to suppress dissent and undermine justice. Last year the UN criticized Cambodia as one of many countries whose laws restricting non-governmental organizations <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-rights-chief-says-ngo-restrictions-undermine-human-rights.php">curtailed freedom of association</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that year Cambodia faced criticism from the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/Default.aspx">International Bar Association</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/credibility-of-cambodia-genocide-tribunal-questioned.php">questioned the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of its <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> [official website], the court established to try top members of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC profile] regime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/06/13/mubarak-era-pm-granted-retrial/">overturned</a> [<em>Daily News Egypt</em> report] his sentence pursuant to Article 166 of <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/final_constitution_30_nov_2012_-english-_-idea.pdf">Egypt's 2012 Constitution</a> [text, PDF, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">report</a>], which states that charges can only be brought against a prime minister in connection with his or her official conduct by the president, the prosecutor general or one-third of the members of the Council of Representatives. The court made this ruling despite the fact that the charges against Nazif were brought before that constitution was ratified. Nazif was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-court-sentences-former-pm-to-three-years-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in September to three years in jail on charges of corruption for allegedly embezzilng $10.5 million during his time in office from 2004 to 2011. No date has been set for his retrial.

<p>Nazif was one of many government officers who served under former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hosni+mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive] to have faced corruption charges since the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian Revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] led to his ousting. Mubarak himself is currently <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/mubarak-appears-for-retrial-of-complicity-charges.php">facing a retrial</a> [JURIST report] on charges of complicity in the murder of more than 800 protesters during the revolution. In April an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/egypt-appeals-court-orders-release-of-muburak.php">ordered that he be released</a> [JURIST report] from prison while awaiting his retrial because he had already served the maximum two years in temporary detention. The former ministers of tourism and housing were <a href="/2013/03/egypt-court-acquits-former-ministers-of-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of corruption charges in March after having been charged with profiteering and illegally selling state-owned land.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontargentinaflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.pjn.gov.ar/">Court of Cassation of Argentina</a>, the highest criminal court, sentenced former <a href="http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/senadores/biografia.php?id_sena=357&iOrden=0&iSen=ASC">Argentine President Carlos Menem</a> [official websites] of selling illegal weapons to Croatia and Ecuador during his presidency. The now-Senator Menem pleaded innocence, claiming that the weapons were intended for Panama and Venezuela but were stolen and sold to parties that violated the <a href="http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/ep_rio01291942.pdf">country's peace agreements</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://books.sipri.org/files/misc/UNAE/SIPRI07UNAEYug.pdf">UN embargoes</a> [summary]. The lower court initially acquitted Menem and 17 other defendants last year on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/argentina-convicts-former-interior-minister-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">series of charges</a> [JURIST report]. On appeal, however, the Court of Cassation sentenced 12 of those defendants to jail time and remanded the case in light of what is described as "overwhelming evidence." Menem, now 82, receives immunity as a public servant. The court urged his fellow representatives to strip him of this privilege, but recent scandals involving his colleagues may make it difficult for a majority of senators to establish that precedent. Furthermore, under Argentina law, all prisoners over 70 have the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/06/13/former-argentine-president-prison/2421435/">right to serve penal time at home</a> [AP report]. Thus, even if the senate does relinquish Menem's immunity, he will most likely never serve time behind bars. 

<p><br />
In 2011, Menem was also put on trial for crimes committed during his presidency. Menem was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/argentina-ex-president-cabinet-members.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by the Federal Court in 2009 on corruption charges for overpaying members of his administration from 1988 to 1989. In October 2008 an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/argentina-ex-president-charged-with.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Menem with allegedly covering up evidence related to the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. Menem, born in Argentina to Syrian immigrants, was accused of covering up the alleged involvement of Syrian-Argentine businessman Alberto Kanoore Edul. Numerous members of his <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Menem">administration</a> [JURIST news archive] have also faced a variety of charges over the past decade, but few have been convicted.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The technician would have to display an image of the fetus, as well as report its health status. Similar to other <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">recent state abortion laws</a> [JURIST news archive], it would require the practitioner to be admitted to practice at a hospital within 30 miles. According to <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website], an abortion clinic in Appleton, Wisconsin, will have to close due to this requirement. The bill will have to pass the senate and the governor before it can go into effect, but the governor has already pledged to sign it. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona</a> (ACLU-AZ) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/sites/default/files/documents/1%20-%20Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in May in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/1r/bills/hb2443p.pdf">state law</a> [HB 2443, PDF] that penalizes doctors, not patients, who perform abortions when the patient's decision is based solely on the gender or race of the fetus. This lawsuit comes on the heels of several developments in controversial state abortion statutes. Earlier in May Arizona's ban on abortions after <a href="paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">20 weeks</a> [JURIST report] was deemed to violate women's rights. Last month a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas [official website] temporarily blocked enforcement of a law banning abortions <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-arkansas-abortion-law-to-proceed.php">12 weeks into a pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In December a state judge in Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">enjoined a law</a> [JURIST report] banning doctors from providing abortions for women more than 20 weeks into gestation. Montana voters in November passed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring notice to parents of minors before a planned abortion procedure. Planned Parenthood also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The blockade, which restricts the flow of goods and people into the region through heavily-guarded border-crossings, has been devastating for the 1.75 million Palestinians living in the region. Falk <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38820#.UbxxHPY6VYk">stated</a> [press release] that Israel should lift the blockade "entirely and immediately," calling it "a deliberate policy of collective punishment which is legally indefensible and morally reprehensible." The announcement followed Israel's approval of the delivery of $100 million in building materials for 1,200 homes and 18 schools for projects in Gaza run by the UN. Falk also commented on the public health situation in the region, stating that Gaza's health ministry has reported that the region is running desperately short on medical supplies and equipment. He urged Israel to act within its obligation under international law to maintain public order and civil life, including the delivery of health care.

<p>Israel's policy in the Gaza Strip has been a subject of controversy. In December 2012, Falk <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel was also <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-aid-groups-urge-israel-to-end-gaza-blockade.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] to end the blockade in June of that year. In 2008, the <a href="Gaza&#8217;s health ministry has reported that the Strip&#8217;s medical supplies and equipment have reached emergency levels.">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] designated Falk as the fifth <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/ps/mandate/">Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights on Palestinian territories occupied since 1967</a> [official website]. In June 2010, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-agrees-to-ease-blockade-in-gaza-strip.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to ease the blockade to <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/obama-welcomes-ease-of-gaza-blockade-urges-israel-to-expand-goods-inflow-1.296945">allow access to more construction materials</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report] to repair damage from the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/operation-cast-lead.htm">2008-2009 Operation Cast Lead</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision accords with the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/E16F1375FA672CCE85257B64004E8BB2/$file/12-5068-1434608.pdf">unanimous decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-nlrb-mandate-to-post-union-rights.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/internet/appellate/main.jsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in <u>National Association of Manufacturers v. National Labor Relations Board</u>. The Fourth Circuit agreed with the DC court that "the rulemaking function provided for in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7/subchapter-II">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [text], by its express terms, only empowers the Board to carry out its statutorily defined reactive roles in addressing unfair labor practice [ULP] charges and conducting representation elections upon request." The court stressed that "[a]lthough the Board is specifically empowered to 'prevent' unfair labor practices, the Board may not act until an unfair labor practice charge is filed alleging a violation of the Act." In holding that the Board was not empowered to promulgate the rule, the court reasoned, "Had Congress intended to grant the NLRB the power to require the posting of employee rights notices, it could have amended the NLRA to do so."

<p>In 2011 the NLRB <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nlrb-orders-union-rights-posted-in-us-businesses.php">issued the regulation</a> [JURIST report] requiring employers to post their employees' rights under the NLRA. These rights include the right to unionize, to bargain collectively and to refuse pressures to do either. The poster also gives some examples of unfair business and union practices and information on contacting the NLRB. The <a href="http://www.nam.org/">National Association of Manufacturers</a> (NAM) [advocacy website] filed a challenge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], which upheld [opinion] the NLRB's requirement but ruled that failure to post could not be considered an unfair labor practice. A similar challenge to the rule was filed in the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website], which <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=910666983282096484&q=Chamber+of+Commerce+v.+National+Labor+Relations+Board&hl=en&as_sdt=4,159">held</a> [opinion] that the NLRB was incapable of enacting the new rules entirely because the NLRA neither required nor provided for such regulation. JURIST Guest Columnist Chris Schlag <a href="/dateline/2012/04/chris-schlag-nlra.php">argued in favor of the rule</a> [JURIST op-ed] last year, finding that open communication is the foundation of a healthy and fair employment environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/14/us-syria-crisis-rights-idUSBRE95D0WP20130614">did not call</a> [Reuters report] for a stoppage of arms flow into Syria, merely a cessation on foreign troops involvement in the conflict. The rights council's decision to discourage such activity comes one day after the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-office-syria-death-toll-at-93000.php">death toll in the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report] had reached at least 93,000.

The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of Assad. <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] released a statement two weeks ago on the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-secretary-general-calls-for-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">condemning the most recent violence</a> [JURIST report] in Syria, and expressing concern over how it has been affecting the civilian population.

While the commission praised Hungary's efforts to strengthen it's rule of law, the report cited several concerns with the new constitution. The report criticized provisions of the constitution requiring a two-thirds super majority to pass many laws where a simple majority was the traditional standard, suggesting the increased standard will act as an impediment to the legislative process. The report also criticized the drafting process of the document, saying it was plagued by "lack of transparency, shortcomings in the dialogue between the majority and the opposition, ... insufficient opportunities for an adequate public debate, and a very tight [time frame]." The Commission also expressed concern that the new constitution does not provide enough strong and specific protection for fundamental rights. The Venice Commission's report is not legally binding, but the commission works closely with the European Union. 

<p>Hungary has been <a href="/forum/2013/04/gabor-halmai-hungary-churches.php">heavily criticized</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the recent changes to its constitution. In May <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/hungary-laws-undermining-human-rights-hrw.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] stating that the new constitution undermined basic human rights. Other constitutional changes that have been subject to criticism include <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-experts-criticize-hungary-law-criminalizing-homelessness.php">restrictions on the homeless</a> [JURIST report], increased control of the media and a strict, narrow definition of family. The new laws were controversial <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hungary-lawmakers-approve-controversial-constitutional-amendments.php">even when they were passed</a> [JURIST report], and have been subject to ongoing scrutiny. In February Hungary's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/hungary-constitutional-court-strikes-down-church-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law that outlines how churches are given official designation, finding that it was too political. In January the court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/hungary-top-court-declares-new-electoral-law-unconstitutional.php">struck down an electoral law</a> [JURIST report] requiring voters to register to vote at least two weeks before elections in 2014.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In doing so, the court invalidated the results of the December election, deeming them unconstitutional. The court also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22927155">upheld</a> [BBC news report] a controversial electoral law imposing a "one person, one vote" regulation on Kuwaitis, which overrode a previous regulation that allowed each individual to vote for multiple candidates. While the government states that this new system will prevent political blocs and put the country in line with many other nations around the world, opposition groups claim that the rule was implemented to weaken their voices. Kuwait is expected to set a new election date soon. 

<p>Kuwait's parliament and election laws have both been sources of controversy over recent years. In December, opposition groups <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20571958">boycotted</a> [BBC news report] the parliamentary elections in protest of the electoral laws. In September the Constitutional Court upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/kuwait-constitutional-court-upholds-controversial-election-law.php">controversial election law</a> [JURIST report] passed in 2006 that divides the country into five voting constituencies. In August leaders of a political opposition in Kuwait <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kuwait-opposition-leaders-criticize-government-challenge-to-election-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the government's efforts to change the country's election law through the Constitutional Court, saying the government is attempting to seize power through the court in violation of the constitution. Also in August the government announced that they had asked the national Constitutional Court to review the legality of the country's election law. In June 2012 the Constitutional Court ruled that the 2012 election for the new parliament was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kuwait-court-invalidates-current-and-reinstates-former-parliament.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and the previous parliament of 2009 should be reinstated, thereby removing the opposition-controlled parliament, and restoring a more government-friendly body. Earlier that month Kuwait's ruler <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4645048.stm">Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sheikh+Sabah+al-Ahmad+al-Sabah">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/world/middleeast/kuwait-parliament-suspended-over-feud.html?_r=3&">suspended</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] the parliament for a month in response to escalating tensions between the more liberal, western-backed lawmakers and the Islamist-led lawmakers. The tension grew when two cabinet ministers resigned under the pressure of the Islamist-led lawmakers who tried to gain more seats. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was passed by the <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">Texas House</a> on April 25 in a 79-50 vote, and by the <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/">Senate</a> [official websites] on May 22 with a vote of 16-15. In a press release, Perry explained that he vetoed the proposed bill because it "duplicates federal law, which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the US <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> [official website]." Had the bill passed, it would have put Texas state laws in line with the federal <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00181:">Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</a> [S.181 materials]. Forty-two states have passed similar equal pay bills. 

<p>In January 2009 US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-signs-bill-clarifying-equal-pay.php">signed into law </a>[JURIST report] the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, extending the deadline for employees to sue their employers for unequal pay discrimination under a disparate treatment theory. The law's "clarification" of equal pay protections effectively overturned the 2007 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-974.pdf">Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &#38; Rubber Co</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/supreme-court-limits-gender-pay.php">report</a>], which held that "a pay-setting decision is a discrete act that occurs at a particular point in time" and that the statutory period for filing a discrimination claim with the EEOC begins when that discrete act occurs. The new law altered <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text] to clarify that the six-month statute of limitations controlling racial, gender, or national origin employment discrimination suits is applicable to each instance of a discriminatory practice, including the receipt of each paycheck, not only to the initial discriminatory act. The initial lawsuit was brought by Lilly Ledbetter, a Goodyear employee for 19 years, who alleged that she received less pay than male counterparts because of gender discrimination. The Supreme Court upheld the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit's <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200315264.pdf">reversal</a> [opinion, PDF] of a district court decision awarding Ledbetter $360,000 in damages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1507.htm">Mount Holly v. Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/11-1507-Mount-Holly-v.-Mount-Holly-Gardens-Citizens-in-Action-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court limited the grant to Question 1: "Are disparate impact claims cognizable under the Fair Housing Act?" The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/title8.php">Fair Housing Act</a> [text] makes it unlawful "[t]o refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer ... or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin." Petitioners sought to redevelop a blighted housing development that was disproportionately occupied by low and moderate income minorities. The redevelopment sought to replace the blighted housing with new market rate housing which was unaffordable to the current residents within the blighted area. Reversing the district court's decision, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4494055075616139213&q=Mt.+Holly+Gardens+Citizens+in+Action,+Inc.+v.+Twp.+of+Mount+Holly,+658+F.3d+375&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">found</a> [opinion] that the respondents presented a <em>prima facie</em> case under the Fair Housing Act despite the fact that there was no evidence of discriminatory intent and no segregative effect.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-315.htm">Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-315-AWAC-cert-petition-FILED-9-11-12-1398998_1.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court limited the grant to the following question: "Whether <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/pdf/aviation_and_transportation_security_act_atsa_public_law_107_1771.pdf">Aviation and Transportation Security Act</a> (ATSA) [text, PDF] immunity may be denied without a determination that the air carrier's disclosure was materially false." The ATSA requires airlines and their employees to report to the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] any and all potential security threats to the nation's air transportation system. To encourage such reports, the ATSA provides a broad grant of immunity from suit, shielding airlines and their employees from all liability, including liability for state-law defamation. The only exception to this immunity is for reports made "with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleading" or "with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of that disclosure." In this case William Hoeper was employed as a pilot by Air Wisconsin. An Air Wisconsin manager reported Hoeper to the TSA as a possible threat after Heoper became angry during a certification test. Hoeper brought a defamation suit against Air Wisconsin in Colorado Court. The Supreme Court of Colorado <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11649948009356592837&q=Air+Wisconsin+Airlines+Corp.+v.+Hoeper&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that Air Wisconsin was not entitled to immunity and that the statements were false.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-992.htm">Ray Haluch Gravel Co. v. Central Pension Fund of the International Union of Operating Engineers and Participating Employers</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Haluch-v-Central-Pension-12-992-BIO-Final.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] a federal district court ruled on a breach-of-contract claim for damages. Just over a month later, it ruled on a discrete contractual claim for damages pleaded in the same complaint, which (a) sought to recoup pre-litigation (as well as litigation) collection expenses and fees and (b) was not contingent on being a "prevailing party" in litigation. The question presented is whether the first order is a "final decision" that must be appealed separately under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1291">28 USC &#167; 1291</a> [text], or whether instead a notice of appeal filed within 30 days of the second order brings the entire case before the court of appeals. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11098828774758390046&q=Central+Pension+Fund+of+Intl.+Union+of+Operating+Engineers+%26+Participating+Employers+v.+Ray+Haluch+Gravel+Co.&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">ruled</a> [opinion] that an appeal filed within 30 days of the second ruling, but more than 30 days after the first ruling, was timely as to all issues.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-5196.htm">Law v.

Texas</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the petitioner's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] claim fails because he did not expressly revoke the privilege against self-incrimination. Genovevo Salinas was suspected of being involved in a murder. He consented to a search of his home, where police found a shotgun, and consented to questioning at the police station, but he was not arrested or given <a href="http://www.mirandawarning.org/whatareyourmirandarights.html">Miranda warnings</a> [backgrounder]. An officer asked, "if the shotgun [his father had given them] would match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder." Salinas looked down and refused to answer the question. The state then offered the refusal to answer as a key piece of evidence against Salinas, which he contends was a violation of his right against self-incrimination. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court disagreed:<blockquote>It has long been settled that the privilege [against self-incrimination] "generally is not self-executing" and that a witness who desires its protection "must claim it." Although "no ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege," ... a witness does not do so by simply standing mute. Because petitioner was required to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting petitioner's Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. In Thomas' view, "Salinas' claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege because the prosecutor's comments regarding his precustodial silence did not compel him to give self-incriminating testimony." Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. In Breyer's view, "the Fifth Amendment here prohibits the prosecution from commenting on the petitioner's silence in response to police questioning."

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-right-to-remain-silent.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. The attorney for Salinas argued that using Salinas' silence in this way violates The Supreme Court's 1987 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Griffith+v.+Kentucky&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39&amp;case=10858659869332197708&amp;scilh=0">Griffith v. Kentucky</a> [opinion]. An assistant district attorney in Houston argued on behalf of Texas. He asserted that "absent invocation" of the right to silence, refusing to answer a question can be used as evidence against a defendant's innocence. The federal government supported this view, arguing that the court's 1983 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Minnesota+v.+Murphy&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,39&amp;case=2775994573652860905&amp;scilh=0">Minnesota v. Murphy</a> [opinion] holds as "the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in order to claim its protection to a noncustodial interview in."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Actavis</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that reverse payment settlements can sometimes violate antitrust laws. A reverse payment settlement, better known as a "pay to delay" settlement, is an agreement in which a patent holder pays a competitor to delay them from entering the market. The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] challenged one such agreement as a violation of antitrust laws, but the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17968051947013153328&q=FTC+v.+Watson+Pharmaceuticals,+Inc.&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">dismissed the complaint</a> [opinion], stating that a reverse payment settlement agreement generally is "immune from antitrust attack so long as its anticompetitive effects fall within the scope of the exclusionary potential of the patent." The Supreme Court reversed in an opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer:<blockquote>In sum, a reverse payment, where large and unjustified, can bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive effects; one who makes such a payment may be unable to explain and to justify it; such a firm or individual may well possess market power derived from the patent; a court, by examining the size of the payment, may well be able to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with its potential justifications without litigating the validity of the patent; and parties may well find ways to settle patent disputes without the use of reverse payments. In our view, these considerations, taken together, outweigh the single strong consideration&#8212;the desirability of settlements&#8212;that led the Eleventh Circuit to provide near-automatic antitrust immunity to reverse payment settlements.</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito was recused from the case.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-forced-arbitration-clauses.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. The FTC argued that reverse payment agreements are "paradigmatic antitrust trust violation[s]" because "they subvert the competitive process by giving generic manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual competition." Respondents, a group of pharmaceutical companies, argued that reverse-payment agreements are simply settlements. "You're not accepting infringement. What you're doing is recognizing there's a reasonable basis to assert the patent, a bona fide reasonable dispute, and the parties have the ability to settle the dispute. Just as if the party&#8212;if someone was entering into a license agreement with&#8212;with someone who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved it." The majority of reverse payment settlements arise in the context of pharmaceutical drug regulation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inter Tribal Council</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that Arizona's law requiring that proof of citizenship be provided in order to register to vote is preempted by federal law. The court found that <a href="http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2004/dec04/prop200.pdf">Proposition 200</a> [text] is preempted by the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/NVRA/">National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA) [official website], which requires states to use the federal voter registration form. The NVRA was passed in 1993 with the purpose of increasing voter registration by removing state imposed barriers. Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the court: "We hold that 42 USC &#167;1973gg-4 precludes Arizona from requiring a Federal Form applicant to submit information beyond that required by the form itself." The opinion preserved states' rights to ultimately control who may vote, by stating that "Arizona may, however, request anew that the [Election Assistance Commission] include such a requirement among the Federal Form's state-specific instructions, and may seek judicial review of the EAC's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act."

<p>Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented separately, and Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion. Thomas based his dissent on his interpretation of the Constitution, in which "The States, not the Federal Government, have the exclusive right to define the 'Qualifications requisite for Electors,' ... which includes the corresponding power to verify that those qualifications have been met." Alito, in his dissent, wrote that "Properly interpreted, the NVRA permits Arizona to require applicants for federal voter registration to provide proof of eligibility." The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-voter-citizenship-requirements.php">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in March, and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-to-consider-arizona-eligibility-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST reports] in October. The Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-arizona-voter-id-law-strikes-down-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the proof of citizenship requirement last year while upholding a provision requiring voters to present photo ID at the polls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence is an "element" that must be submitted to the jury, overruling its 2002 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8039199293870837752&q=Harris+v.+United+States,+536+U.S.+545,+122&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Harris v. United States</a> [opinion]. <span class="casename">Harris</span> was a 5-4 splintered opinion that allowed a judge to be the fact-finder when increasing mandatory minimum sentences, as opposed to requiring the question to go to the jury. Monday's decision was also splintered with Justice Clarence Thomas delivering the opinion of the court:<blockquote>Here, the sentencing range supported by the jury's verdict was five years' imprisonment to life. The District Court imposed the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence based on its finding by a preponderance of evidence that the firearm was "brandished." Because the finding of brandishing increased the penalty to which the defendant was subjected, it was an element, which had to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge, rather than the jury, found brandishing, thus violating petitioner&#8217;s Sixth Amendment rights.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate concurring opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Justice Stephen Breyer also filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy. Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate dissent.

<p>Since <span class="casename">Harris</span> was decided, the court has gained three new members, and two in the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, have left the court. At <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-mandatory-sentences-speedy-trial-clause.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in January, counsel for the defendant argued, "Any fact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence more severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt." Counsel for the US urged the court to adhere to its ruling in <span class="casename">Harris</span>, "because those decisions properly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum divests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Spears</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that an attorney's solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered by the litigation exception to the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C123.txt">Driver's Privacy Protection Act</a> (DPPA) [text]. Under the DPPA, disclosure of personal information contained in the records of state motor vehicle departments (DMVs) is prohibited except for a purpose permitted by an exception listed in 1 of 14 statutory subsections. Subsection (b)(4) permits obtaining personal information from a state DMV for use "in connection with" judicial and administrative proceedings, including "investigation in anticipation of litigation." Respondents obtained names and addresses of thousands of individuals from the South Carolina DMV in order to send letters to find plaintiffs for a lawsuit they had filed against car dealers for violations of South Carolina law. Petitioners, South Carolina residents whose information was obtained and used without their consent, sued respondents for violating the DPPA. Respondents claimed the solicitation letters were permitted under subsection (b)(4). In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kenned, the court disagreed: "In light of the text, structure, and purpose of the DPPA, the Court now holds that an attorney's solicitation of clients is not a permissible purpose covered by the (b)(4) litigation exception." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg concludes: "The Court today exposes lawyers whose conduct meets state ethical requirements to huge civil liability and potential criminal liability. It does so by adding to the DPPA's litigation exception a solicitation bar Congress did not place in that exception."

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-warrantless-blood-alcohol-tests.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in this case in January. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the opposing lawyers were undertaking a solicitation of individuals as potential clients for their own commercial purpose and were not using the information in connection with litigation. They further argued that the primary purpose of the DPPA was to prevent such solicitations, thus all of the exceptions must be read in light of that primary purpose. Counsel for the respondents, argued that the "litigation" exception was extremely broad, authorizing any use of driver information "covering the litigation process from cradle to grave."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Clifford, who has served in all three federal branches, is now a privately practicing attorney and an informal adviser to <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] and has served under both Democrat and Republican leadership. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-comment-appointment-envoy-close-guantanamo">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], a supporter of the closure of Guantanamo Bay, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-comment-appointment-envoy-close-guantanamo">welcomed the appointment</a> [press release] and urged quick action:<blockquote>The president now has ordered the restart of transfers out of Guantanamo, lifted the moratorium on transfers to Yemen, and appointed top officials at the White House and State Department to get it done. Once President Obama makes the necessary appointment at the Pentagon to begin transferring detainees out of Guantanamo, he should immediately begin doing so. With more than half of the detainees already cleared for transfer or release, and dozens more being held without ever being charged or tried, it's time to start sending these men home.</blockquote>On Sunday, the Pentagon Prosecutor at Guantanamo announced that only <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/16/3455042/prosecutor-court-ruling-cuts.html">seven more captives are expected to be charged</a> [AP report] at Guantanamo. Six are accused of death-penalty crimes related to the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. 

<p>Earlier this month the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/home">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">2014 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF], which would keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open despite Obama's statements that he will close it. According to the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=4161cd66-5e41-4d4e-a98f-9cc1ddbcec91">official summary</a> [text, PDF], the bill allocates over 200 million dollars to restore dilapidated facilities, as well as improve staff facilities. Last month Obama renewed his pledge to make an <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-addresses-us-drone-strikes-steps-to-close-guantanamo.php">effort to close the detention center</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May JURIST Guest Columnist David Frakt of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law argued that the Obama administration <a href="/forum/2013/04/david-frakt-hunger-strike.php">should release those detainees</a> [JURIST op-ed] held at Guantanamo Bay who have already been declared to not be a danger to the US. In April UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for US authorities to close down the Guantanamo prison <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-chief-calls-for-guantanamo-prison-closure.php">camp</a> [JURIST report], emphasizing the continued indefinite incarcerations of many detainees as a clear violation of international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/CCR_FIDH_DEATH_PENALTY_REPORT_FINAL%20EXECUTIVE%20SUMMARY.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] concludes that the way the death penalty is used in California and Louisiana is arbitrary and discriminatory and that conditions on death row constitute torture. Although the CCR and FIDH found that the use of the death penalty in and of itself constitutes an inherent violation of humans' fundamental right to life, general recommendations were suggested to ensure that the death penalty be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner and that conditions on death row minimize human suffering.

<p>According to a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/death-penalty-use-declines-worldwide-ai.php">study</a> [JURIST report] released by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] in April, although use of the death penalty has decreased worldwide since 2003, the US was one of the five countries employing the death penalty most frequently in 2012. In spite of this, many states have moved to abolish the death penalty in recent years. In May Maryland <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/biography.asp">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/maryland-governor-signs-bill-repealing-death-penalty.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill to repeal the death penalty. Maryland is the eighteenth state to repeal the death penalty and the sixth do to so in the previous five years. <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports] have all recently eliminated the death penalty, while 32 states retain its use, according to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> [advocacy website]. However, California voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/california-modifies-three-strikes-law-keeps-death-penalty-in-referendum.php">declined to repeal the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] on the most recent ballot, with 47 percent of voters supporting the repeal last November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, Beyani encouraged the government to address equal land, housing and property rights for displaced women in accordance with international standards. Beyani stated:<blockquote>New opportunities now exist for taking an inclusive integrated approach for all waves of IDPs, in the country. ... These include: the proposed revised legislation on IDPs; the realignment of the 2007 strategy on IDPs with the proposed law; the onset of a new registration exercise for all IDPs that should as well profile their vulnerability and needs, and inclusive policies being formulated by the Government in the fields of health, land, agriculture, education, and employment generating activities.</blockquote>In order to reach a durable solution, Beyani urged politicians to resist political deadlock: "I call upon all parties concerned to urgently reach a political solution to enable those internally displaced persons who wish to return to their areas of origin to do so voluntarily in safety and dignity."

<p>Thousands of people were displaced and several thousand were killed as a result of conflicts with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18175030">Abkhazia</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/3797729.stm">South Ossetia</a> [BBC backgrounders; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=South+Ossetia">news archive</a>] in the early 1990s. The 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7548715.stm">conflict</a> [BBC report] between Russia and Georgia caused the number of refugees to rise again. In January Georgia's parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/georgia-frees-190-political-prisoners.php">freed 190 prisoners</a> [JURIST report], many of which were arrested while protesting Georgia President Mikhail Saakashvili, as part of an amnesty agreement that was strongly opposed by Saakashvili.

The <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/pennsylvania-judges-challenge-mandatory-retirement.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report], originally filed by six Pennsylvania judges, alleged that the mandatory retirement provision in the <a href="http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html">Pennsylvania Constitution</a> [text] was in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution. The court, although sympathetic, held that because of the people's indefeasible right to alter their government by amending the Constitution, the mandatory retirement provision was subject to deferential, rational basis review under both equal protection and due process. The court concluded that that standard had been satisfied:<blockquote>Therefore, although certain societal circumstances may have changed since 1968 when the challenged provision was added to the Constitution&#8212;and, indeed, some of the original justifications for mandatory retirement may not have reflected the most fair or even the most beneficial public policy&#8212;the proper approach of conforming the Constitution more closely with Petitioners' vision of how experiential changes should be taken into account is to pursue further amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution.</blockquote>The matter was remanded to the Commonwealth Court for dismissal of the complaints with prejudice, and judgment granted in favor of the Commonwealth.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] has previously considered the merits of a challenge to mandatory retirement provisions of a state constitution. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=872431609081984169">Gregory v. Ashcroft</a> [opinion], Missouri state court judges challenged a mandatory retirement provision in the state constitution, but the Supreme Court held that the provision did not violate equal protection. Mandatory retirement laws have been considered in European courts of law as well. In November the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-strikes-down-hungary-law-lowering-retirement-age-for-judges.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law which would have lowered the mandatory retirement age for judges in Hungary from 70 to 62, stating the law was not proportionate to the objectives Hungary was pursing. In 2009 the ECJ ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/europe-court-rules-uk-mandatory.php">UK mandatory retirement laws were not discriminatory</a> [JURIST report], stating age-based classifications are justifiable in some circumstances. The ECJ also ruled in 2007 that the EU's <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/eu-court-upholds-mandatory-retirement.php">mandatory retirement policies</a> [JURIST report] did not violate the prohibition against age discrimination if the policy is intended to further the legitimate public interest of increasing employment and the retirees are provided with full pensions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chairman of the Court of Cassation in Green Mountain province Judge Abdel-Aziz Mustafa al-Trabelsi <a href="http://www.lana-news.ly/ara/news/view/24758/">confirmed</a> [LANA report; in Arabic] that his colleague was killed outright in the drive-by attack. This attack is the latest of an increasing number of threats and attacks on the judiciary in Derna, a city known to be an Islamic stronghold and which houses extremist Salafist militias such as Ansar al-Shariah, the group that claimed responsibility for the 2012 raid of the US Embassy in Benghazi. In March, a lower court building was <a href="http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/16/35028/">damaged</a> [<em>Libya Herald</em> report] by a bomb blast, however no one was injured in that attack.

In April Libya's national assembly <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/libya-national-assembly-criminalizes-torture-kidnapping.php">criminalized</a> [JURIST report] torture and kidnapping in an attempt to rein in the country's armed militias. In March Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/hrw-urges-libya-government-to-ensure-protection-of-civilians.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Libya government to ensure the protection of civilians. Also in March the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/libya-court-begins-trial-of-gaddafi-era-officials.php">trial</a> [JURIST report] of 40 former Libyan officials began earlier in al-Zawiya. The charges included inciting the killing of protesters during the revolution, wasting public funds, embezzlement and abuse of power. In February the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/jurist-the-international-criminal-court.php">called on Libya</a> [JURIST report] to extradite former Gaddafi intelligence chief <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17414121">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [BBC profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Slovakian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/slovakia-police-begin-investigation-of-accused-nazi-from-hungary.php">began the investigation</a> [JURIST report] of Csatary in September after he was arrested on allegations of abusing and assisting in the deportation of thousands of Jews to concentration camps during the Holocaust. The arrest came after the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish human rights organization committed to finding and prosecuting Holocaust war criminals, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/nazi-war-crimes-suspect-allegedly-in-hungary.php">submitted new evidence</a> [JURIST report] to the Budapest prosecutor's office detailing the war crimes allegedly committed by Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary, a former senior Hungarian police officer in the Slovakian city of Kosice. The evidence alleged that Csatary was one of the main actors responsible for deporting 300 Jews from Kosice to Kamenetz-Podolsk in Ukraine, where they were killed in 1941. The SWC also accused Csatary of being responsible for transferring about 15,700 Jews to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> [JURIST news archive]. A court in Czechoslovakia sentenced Csatary to death <em>in absentia</em> in 1948, but the country subsequently abolished the death penalty before dividing into Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In March a Slovakian court altered Csatary's sentence to life imprisonment. Csatary's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22949611">trial will begin</a> [BBC report] within the next three months.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, authorities have continued to arrest individuals charged with war crimes during the Holocaust. In May German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/germany-authorities-arrest-alleged-nazi-guard.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a 93-year-old man for allegedly serving as a guard at Auschwitz and assisting in the mass murder carried out at the death camp.

John Jones, Saif al-Islam's lawyer, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/18/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-son-libya">fears that his client will be given the death penalty</a> [AP report] in Libya, and will have no opportunity for appeal. Jones asked the ICC to reject Libya's request to suspend the order to transfer Saif al-Islam to the Hague and called Libya's announcement that the trial will begin in August a "blatant disregard for these obligations." Saif al-Islam is accused of crimes against the state for transferring information related to Libya's national security to an ICC delegation, insulting Libya's new flag and attempting to escape from prison.

<p>Saif al-Islam made his <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/gaddafis-son-makes-second-appearance-in-libya-court.php">second appearance in court</a> in early May, but the trial was postponed at that time to allow for more preparation.

His appearance came after the ICC demanded that Libyan officials address reports that they planned to try Saif al-Islam and former Gaddafi intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi. Libya has continued to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/libya-denies-request-to-hand-over-gaddafis-son-to-icc--dnp.php">refuse</a> to hand the two men over to the ICC after <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/libya-to-try-gaddafi-son-intelligence-chief-within-next-month.php">announcing plans to try them</a> [JURIST reports] in Libya. In October Libyan government lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to allow them to be tried in Libya and promised that the trial would be fair. In August Saif al-Islam stated that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">preferred to be tried by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] out of fear that Libya would not try him fairly. Last June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam, including Melinda Taylor, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] by Libyan security forces and were in custody for nearly four weeks before being released.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing, which was scheduled to begin on September 26, will not start until February 10. At the hearing, the judge will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support the prosecution's charges. Ntaganga is accused of recruiting child soldiers during the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Five Year War.  The prosecution will be collecting evidence to support 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

<p>Ntaganga first appeared in front of the ICC in March and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/congo-war-crimes-suspect-denies-charges-in-first-appearance-before-icc-done.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the charges against him.

<a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Patrick Quinn</a> [official website] on Tuesday signed the most restrictive <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1715&GAID=12&DocTypeID=SB&SessionID=85&GA=98">fracking legislation</a> [SB 1715] in the country into law. The bill was a joint effort between government and industry specialists and is <a href="http://www3.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=3&RecNum=11278">receiving high praise</a> [press release] from the state's environmental and manufacturing communities. It requires all drillers to acquire a permit from the legislature and provide frackwater samples before, after and during drilling. It also requires drillers to store used frackwater in above-ground tanks. Frackwater is usually stored in open-air in-ground pits that have been allegedly found in the past to seep chemicals into soil during heavy rains. Furthermore, the new law provides for more public debate by requiring open comment periods and hearings for all drilling applications. Jen Waling, of the <a href="http://ilenviro.org/">Illinois Environmental Council</a> [advocacy website], said:<blockquote>While our community still has concerns about the environmental impacts of this new technology, it is essential for these tough restrictions to become law to protect our communities. The environmental community looks forward to working with the governor and agencies to make sure that this bill is strongly enforced.</blockquote>Multiple government and energy representatives commented on the bill, most focused on how it will be enforceable without hampering industry or environmental interests.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/fracking/">Hydraulic fracturing</a> [JURIST news archive], commonly referred to as "fracking," is a highly debated topic in regions where recent Marcellus shale gas developments have been associated with toxic water pollution. The <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/">New York State Assembly</a> [official website] in March <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/new-york-lawmakers-approve-two-year-fracking-moratorium.php">approved a two-year ban</a> [JURIST report] on fracking. The measure postpones any potential fracking until May 15, 2015, by which time a "comprehensive health impact assessment" can be conducted to identify potential public health impacts that may result from the process. The ban represents a continuation of a previous ban on fracking that has been in place in the state since 2008. Also in March, JURIST guest columnist Nicolas Parke <a href="/dateline/2013/03/nicolas-parke-fracking-regulation.php">debunked the rumors</a> [JURIST op-ed] around fracking. In February JURIST guest columnist Samantha Peaslee detailed the <a href="/dateline/2013/02/samantha-peaslee-home-rule-fracking.php">future of fracking</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Colorado in the wake of recent lawsuits against fracking companies in the state. In 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-agencies-submit-brief-in-shale-drilling-law-appeal.php">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-bill-to-allow-fracking.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/new-jersey-legislature-passes-one-year-fracking-ban.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-jersey-legislature-passes-ban-on-shale-gas-fracking.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-ag-sues-us-government-for-failure-to-study-fracking-impact.php">New York</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/epa-announces-plan-to-develop-standards-for-fracking-wastewater-discharge.php">Environmental Protection Agency</a> [JURIST reports] all took regulatory, legislative and judicial steps towards restricting hydraulic fracturing for fear of environmental and public health concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The future of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Turkey">Gezi Park</a> [JURIST news archive], a rare green space in Istanbul, will be established by a court decision subject to a referendum, in lieu of further police-protester confrontations. The proposed development of the park sparked conflict when the government decided to build over it. Some parties believed that rebuilding the historic park was politically motivated because it is viewed by some as a symbol of liberal values. At least four people died during the conflicts under a variety of circumstances. Pillay said: <blockquote>The atmosphere is still clearly highly combustible ... and it is important that the authorities recognize that the initial extremely heavy-handed response to the protests, which resulted in many injuries, is still a major part of the problem. Because of that response, the scope of the protests broadened to include other aspects of governance, including those relating to fundamental human rights, such as freedom of assembly and freedom of opinion and expression.</blockquote>She urged authorities "to facilitate and protect peaceful gatherings and protests."

<p>Pillay previously <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/un-rights-office-urges-turkey-to-ensure-right-to-assembly.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Turkey to respect the right to assemble.

This outbreak of violence comes about one month after Turkey's Grand National Assembly <a href="http://www.bianet.org/english/politics/145791-parliament-approves-new-judicial-reforms">approved amendments</a> [BIA summary] to the country's anti-terrorism laws to bring them more in line with EU freedom of expression standards. In February the Council of Europe urged Turkey to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/council-of-europe-urges-turkey-to-speed-up-legislation-reform.php">move more quickly</a> [JURIST report] in its efforts to reform the laws governing freedom of expression and anti-terrorism. In November the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="/hotline/2011/04/justice-must-be-brought-to-turkish-journalists.php">criticized Turkey for prosecuting activists</a> [JURIST op-ed] under the country's vague counterterrorism law.

The names were released in response to a <a href="http://www.foia.gov">Freedom of Information Act</a> [official website] request submitted by the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/17/3456263/list-of-indefinite-detainees.html">Miami Herald</a> [report] and the <em>New York Times</em>. In the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf">2010 Guantanamo Review Task Force</a> [PDF] the US government explained continued detention:<blockquote>48 detainees were unanimously approved for continued detention under the AUMF based on a finding that they pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated sufficiently at this time if they were to be transferred from U.S. custody. The Task Force concluded as to all of these detainees that prosecution is not feasible at this time in either federal court or the military commission system. At the Same time, the Task Force concluded that there is a lawful basis for continuing to detain these detainees under the AUMF.</blockquote>Two Afghan detainees on the list, Awal Gul and Inayatullah, have died while being detained at Guantanamo. 

<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon Prosecutor at Guantanamo announced that only <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/16/3455042/prosecutor-court-ruling-cuts.html">seven more captives are expected to be charged</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report]> report] at Guantanamo. Last week the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> [official website] announced that <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-military-prosecutors-charge-guantanamo-detainee-with-war-crimes.php">military commission charges</a> [JURIST report] were filed against Iraqi prisoner And al-Hadi al-Iraqi for allegedly commanding al Qaeda. Earlier in June, the House Armed Services Committee approved the 2014 <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF], which would keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open.

The rights group allege that the NYPD has been sending spies into mosques, student associations and other places to gather information based solely on the fact that the targets are Muslim. The <a href="http://www.nyclu.org">New York Civil Liberties Union</a>, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.cunyclear.org">Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &#38; Responsibility</a> (Clear) [advocacy websites] project of Main Street Legal Services, Inc. at CUNY School of Law <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/rights-groups-file-lawsuit-challenging-nypds-muslim-surveillance-program">argue</a> [press release] that the program violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The ACLU said, "The lawsuit asks the court to end the NYPD's Muslim Surveillance Program, and to prevent future surveillance based solely or predominately on religion in the absence of individualized suspicion of criminal activity." The rights groups are <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/legal-challenge-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program-plaintiff-profiles">representing</a> [ACLU report] Hamid Hassan Raza, Masjid Al-Ansar, Asad Dandia, Muslims Giving Back, Masjid At-Taqea and Mohammed Elshinawy. The suit was filed in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] listing New York City <a href="http://www.mikebloomberg.com">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> [official website], Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence David Cohen as defendants.

<p>In February a federal judge <a href="http://www.nylj.com/nylawyer/adgifs/decisions/021413scheindlin2.pdf">granted</a> [opinion, PDF] class action status in a lawsuit brought to <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-judge-grants-class-action-status-to-challenge-of-nypd-stop-and-frisk-policy.php">stop the NYPD from continuing its "stop-and-frisk"</a> [JURIST report] practice outside of apartment buildings in the Bronx. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionally of "Operation Clean Halls," which is part of the NYPD's broader "stop-and-frisk" policy that allows police to patrol private apartments all over New York City. The NYPD has come under scrutiny in the past for alleged discriminatory surveillance. Last June <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/muslim-rights-group-files-lawsuit-challenging-nypd-surveillance-program.php">Muslim rights group filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] alleging that the NYPD had engaged in surveillance of Muslim schools, including kindergarten and elementary schools, as well as entire communities. Senior Volunteer Attorney for the Muslim Civil Liberties Union, <a href="/hotline/2012/05/samar-warsi-muslim-surveillance.php">Samar Warsi commented</a> [JURIST hotline] that the NYPD surveillance of Muslims can have serious implication for civil liberties in the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's call to the Hungarian government came after the <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/">Venice Commission</a> [official website] released a report expressing concern that the new constitution does <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/european-commission-criticizes-hungary-constitution-amendments.php">not afford enough protection</a> [JURIST report] for fundamental human rights. Pillay welcomed the Venice Commission's report and also reminded the Hungarian government that a number of its legislative changes since 2010 have come under scrutiny by various UN special rapporteurs. Pillay stated, "Hungary should seek to maintain high standards of human rights protection."

<p>Hungary has recently received much <a href="/forum/2013/04/gabor-halmai-hungary-churches.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the recent changes to its constitution.

Other constitutional changes have been subject to criticism, including <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-rights-experts-criticize-hungary-law-criminalizing-homelessness.php">restrictions on the homeless</a> [JURIST report] and increased control of the media.

AI claims that those companies should be held accountable for the longstanding, ongoing human rights abuses related to child labor, on-site injuries, financial exploitation and the illegal detainment of workers in handmade jail cells. Although AI does not claim that the Chinese companies are the original source of such treatment, the likes of which have been recorded for decades, it does maintain that the companies must be held accountable for the current situation. Furthermore, AI contends that the companies hold undue economic influence in the region, debasing the rule of law and human rights, and allowing mining interests to literally relocate entire towns without providing any compensation for lost homes or resources. According to the report, DRC is in violation of several and UN resolutions regarding the human rights of workers:<blockquote>In addition to the violations of the rights to work and health, the security system being implemented at the site has exposed artisanal miners to serious abuses, including arbitrary and unlawful detention. ... None of the human rights violations or abuses ... [have] been addressed.</blockquote>The report named more than a dozen agreements, treaties, resolutions and statutes that are violated by the current working conditions of the mine workers of the DRC. There has been no official response from the DRC regarding this report. 

<p>Last month AI <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/amnesty-international-publishes-annual-human-rights-report.php">published its annual report</a> [JURIST report] entitled <a href="http://files.amnesty.org/air13/AmnestyInternational_AnnualReport2013_complete_en.pdf">State of the World's Human Rights</a> [materials], which details the human rights landscape across the world in 2012. The report focuses on the increasing danger faced by those displaced from their homes, which includes members of communities in the DRC where mining companies have bought the mining rights and been permitted to vacate the surface occupants. Chinese mining companies in <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/china-mining-companies-in-zambia-violating-labor-laws-hrw.php">Zambia</a> [JURIST report] have also been accused of human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its ruling, the Supreme Court stated that families claiming that the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website] did not fulfill its duty of adequately protecting a family member by providing appropriate weaponry or armored vehicles <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-supreme-court-says-families-of-soldiers-killed-in-iraq-can-sue-government/2013/06/19/acd418f8-d8c9-11e2-b418-9dfa095e125d_story.html">could launch damages claims</a> [AP report] under theories of negligence and human rights. The Supreme Court added, however, that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22967853">certain things will still not be challengeable</a> [BBC report] under human rights law, such as decisions made in the heat of battle. The families of these soldiers are now able to bring these claims against the MOD and may proceed to trial.

<p>This ongoing case arose from the 2003 death of <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/143.aspx">Territorial Army</a> [official website] Private Jason Smith in Basra. The Assistant Deputy Coroner for Oxfordshire <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6326193.stm">Andrew Walker</a> [BBC profile] found that Smith's death was the result of "a serious failure to recognize and take appropriate steps to address the difficulty that he had in adjusting to the climate." Walker prompted Smith's family to file suit against the MOD. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/you-and-the-judiciary/going-to-court/high-court">High Court</a> [official website] subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-court-rules-failure-to-equip-troops.php">ruled in 2008</a> [JURIST report] that British service members are entitled to legal protection of their human rights "wherever they may be." This ruling came despite arguments by the MOD that the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">Human Rights Act 1998</a> [text] does not apply to soldiers on active service abroad outside bases under British military jurisdiction. In May 2009 the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/civilappeals.htm">England and Wales Court of Appeal (Civil Division)</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/uk-court-rules-european-human-rights.php">upheld the High Court's ruling</a> [JURIST report], finding that the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text] applies to UK troops serving abroad. The court found that the UK's obligation under the Human Rights Act extends in some cases beyond territorial jurisdiction, including foreign service by military personnel.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Tuesday voted in favor of a <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1797">bill</a> [HR 1797] that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill passed by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll251.xml">228-196</a> [roll call vote] mainly along party lines. The White House on Monday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/113/saphr1797r_20130617.pdf">expressed opposition</a> [statement, PDF] to the legislation: "If the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill." Before it reaches the president, the bill must pass the Democrat-controlled Senate. The legislation has not been scheduled for a vote and is not expected to be scheduled in the near future.

<p>Multiple states have attempted to impose greater restrictions on abortion over the past several years. A <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">similar Arizona law</a> was deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge just last month, and <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-state-judge-enjoins-post-20-week-abortion-ban.php">another similar law was enjoined</a> [JURIST reports] by a Georgia state court in December.

The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] released their opinion in the case of <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/44E4BD6B382C2C5985257B8E004F70A6/$file/11-5344-1441731.pdf">Abdul Al Qader Hussain v. Barack Obama</a> [opinion, PDF] in which <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+HTE">Judge Harry Edwards</a> [official profile] wrote a concurring opinion. The majority opinion found that Abdul al Qader Ahmed Hussain had been affiliated with al Qaeda and the Taliban, and was therefore properly detained. In his concurrence Edwards conceded that while the president was authorized to detain Hussain under the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/pdf/PLAW-107publ40.pdf">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text, PDF], there was no evidence that he had "aided" those who engaged in terrorist attacks. Edwards wrote:<blockquote>I am constrained by the law of the circuit to concur in the judgment of the court. The majority opinion is unassailable in holding that our precedent (which conflates the preponderance of the evidence and substantial evidence standards) supports the result reached. I have no authority to stray from precedent. However, when I review a record like the one presented in this case, I am disquieted by our jurisprudence. I think we have strained to make sense of the applicable law, apply the applicable standards of review, and adhere to the commands of the Supreme Court. The time has come for the President and Congress to give serious consideration to a different approach for the handling of the Guantanamo detainee cases.</blockquote>Edwards also voiced the opinion that the court was setting bad precedent potentially allowing the government to detain "any young, Muslim man" who is traveling through or residing in an area where there is a terrorist presence.

<p>Earlier this week the US government <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-government-releases-names-of-indefinite-guantanamo-detainees.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the names and nationalities of 46 men who are classified for "continued detention" at Guantanamo Bay, ineligible for release, transfer or prosecution. Also this week <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/obama-appoints-guantanamo-closure-envoy.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] Clifford Sloan to be the new envoy in charge of closing Guantanamo Bay. The Pentagon Prosecutor at Guantanamo announced that only seven more captives are <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/16/3455042/prosecutor-court-ruling-cuts.html">expected to be charged</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] at Guantanamo. Last week the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] announced that military commission <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-military-prosecutors-charge-guantanamo-detainee-with-war-crimes.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] were filed against Iraqi prisoner And al-Hadi al-Iraqi for allegedly commanding al Qaeda. Earlier in June the House Armed Services Committee <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/house-panel-approves-defense-spending-bill-that-blocks-guantanamo-closure.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS29/20130522/100881/BILLS-113HR1960ih.pdf">2014 National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [HR 1960, PDF], which would keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay commended Myanmar <a href="http://www.president-office.gov.mm/en/">President Thein Sein</a> [official website] for statements on the need to end discrimination and violence but pointed to ongoing human rights violations against the Rohingya community in <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21565638-why-buddhists-and-muslims-rakhine-state-myanmar-are-each-others%E2%80%99-throats-unforgiving">Rakhine State</a> [Economist backgrounder] as a pressing issue the government needs to tackle or risk harming reform efforts. According to the statement, more than 140,000 people have been displaced by violence between Buddhist and Muslim communities last year in the region, many escaping on boats. The High Commissioner urged the government to, "urgently pursue legal and institutional reforms, including reforming local orders and national laws that discriminate along lines of ethnicity and religion." She also voiced concern over reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, sexual violence and extrajudicial killings carried out by government security forces. 

<p>Concern over Myanmar's sectarian violence and human rights record has been growing recently, as the country has attempted to normalize relationships with the US. Last month <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/index.htm">UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar</a> [official website] Tomas Ojea Quintana released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-accountability-for-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">welcoming recommendations</a> [JURIST report] by the Myanmar government's Rakhine Investigation Commission, but at the same time also voicing a strong need for the government to address impunity and ensure investigations into credible allegations of systematic human rights violations against Muslims in Rakhine state. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a statement demanding that the Myanmar government investigate and <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/myanmar-government-urged-to-provide-justice-for-attacks-on-muslim-community.php">hold accountable</a> [JURIST report] those involved in the deadly violence in the Mandalay Region in March, in which an estimated 40 people were killed and 61 more were wounded. Also in April Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-tackle-religious-violence.php">expressed serious concerns</a> [JURIST report] in a report on growing violence between Muslim and Buddhist communities in Myanmar. The Special Rapporteur urged bold action by the Myanmar government to combat this trend, and stated that government inaction has helped fuel the spread of discrimination and prejudice against Muslim communities across the country. In March Quintana <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-expert-urges-myanmar-to-address-remaining-issues.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] the country of the possibility that the current reformation process may be endangered by leaving areas of importance untouched, especially related to the states of Rakhine and Kachin.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, represented by <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] attorney Cecillia Wang, argued that the law denies immigrants their due process rights and serves an unlawful punitive purpose. The appeals court, finding no evidence in the law's legislative history of a punitive purpose, was unpersuaded. In his majority opinion, Judge Richard Tallman stated  "Proposition 100's legitimate&#8212;indeed its compelling&#8212;purpose is ensuring that defendants remain in the United States to stand trial for alleged felony violations of Arizona's criminal laws." Judge Raymond Fisher dissented, stating:<blockquote>The excessiveness and overbreadth of this scheme, particularly in light of its legislative history, reveal that the real purpose of Proposition 100 was to use the categorical denial of bail to punish arrestees&#8212;for their assumed undocumented status and for their suspected but unproven crimes.</blockquote>According to Fisher, the law "reflects a serious devaluation of the presumption of innocence and the constitutional principle that arrestees may not be punished before judgment of guilt."

<p>The ACLU along with the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/rights-groups-challenge-arizona-illegal.php">filed the suit</a> [JURIST report] in April 2008. The Arizona government <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/anti-immigration-measures-pass-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] Proposition 100 in November 2006, along with three other measures directed at illegal immigration. In October 2007 the Arizona Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the law, ruling that it did not violate undocumented immigrants' due process rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpakistan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Swiss government cannot reopen the corruption charges against Pakistan <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] because the statutory limitations period has lapsed, Pakistan Law Minister Zahid Hamid announced Wednesday. Swiss authorities sent their position in February of this year, but the sealed letter was <a href="http://beta.dawn.com/news/1019111/swiss-govt-calls-zardari-case-time-barred">officially opened</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] by Hamid Tuesday. The case against Zardari was closed in 2008. However, following pressure from the Supreme Court, former law minister Farooq Naek wrote to Swiss authorities to reopen the case, while also requesting that the case not affect the immunity granted to the president by the constitution. In their letter dated February 9, Swiss authorities declined, stating that Pakistan is abusing its power by demanding resumption of the criminal cases, while maintaining that such resumption could not take place. Zardari is accused of laundering USD 60,000,000 through Swiss banks. The Law Ministry is consulting with the Swiss attorney general to determine its future course of action. 

<p>Political leaders' reluctance to open a corruption case against the president has caused conflict between the country's judiciary and executive branches. Hamid has since <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/565006/law-and-justice-minister-files-application-to-change-ministry/">asked to resign</a> [IHT report] from the ministry Tuesday after being named as a defendant in a suit against former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive]. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">forced out of office</a> last June after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">convicted him of contempt</a> [JURIST reports] for failing to pursue a corruption case against the president. In July, only a month after Raja Pervez Ashraf became prime minister, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-high-court-orders-new-pm-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">ordered him to reopen the investigation</a> [JURIST report] against Zardari within three weeks. Also that month, the National Assembly of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-shield-pm-from-contempt-proceedings.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to shield senior officials from contempt of court proceedings, which was widely seen as an attempt to exempt Ashraf from possible claims of contempt for failing to follow the order. When Ashraf did not do as the court requested, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-high-court-postpones-order-to-reopen-investigation-of-president.php">granted him another two weeks</a> [JURIST report] to comply with its order.

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to limit the way sentencing courts can use prior convictions to enhance sentencing for federal crimes. The question before the court was whether Matthew Descamps' burglary conviction under California law could allow a conviction under federal burglary law, which had slightly different requirements than California's statute. Federal judges used the "modified categorical approach" and looked at a limited number of documents to determine that Descamps was convicted of the elements of the generic crime under federal law. Thus, when Descamps was convicted of a federal felony, the government translated his previous California crime to a federal one to increase his sentence under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/924">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> [text] (ACCA). In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the court held, "that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single, indivisible set of elements."<blockquote>the District Court should not have enhanced his sentence under ACCA. That court and the Ninth Circuit erred in invoking the modified categorical approach to look behind Descamps' conviction in search of record evidence that he actually committed the generic offense. The modified approach does not authorize a sentencing court to substitute such a facts-based inquiry for an elements-based one. A court may use the modified approach only to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant&#8217;s conviction.</blockquote>The court reversed the decision of the US Court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 

<p>Justices Antohny Kennedy and Clarence Thomas filed concurring opinions. Justice Samuel Alito filed a dissent. Alito wrote that he "would give ACCA a more practical reading. When it is clear that a defendant necessarily admitted or the jury necessarily found that the defendant committed the elements of generic burglary, the conviction should qualify." At <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-class-actions-federal-and-state-laws.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in January, Descamps' attorney argued that his client was deprived of having the federal crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the elements of California burglary are too removed from the federal elements. The United States government argued that, since Descamps pleaded guilty, he pleaded guilty to the generic crime of burglary, not the elements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Italian Colors Restaurant</a> [SCOTSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff's cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. The plaintiffs in the case are several retail businesses that have accepted American Express charge cards. They argue that American Express's arbitration clause, which forbids plaintiffs from filing as a class, violates the FAA because the cost of individual arbitration would exceed potential recovery for any individual plaintiff. Nevertheless, the court reversed the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which had <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/87ef44f0-26db-4347-82c1-6cfd46d1e6f5/2/doc/06-1871_2_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/87ef44f0-26db-4347-82c1-6cfd46d1e6f5/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the arbitration clause was unenforceable:<blockquote>The regime established by the Court of Appeals' decision would require&#8212;before a plaintiff can be held to contractually agreed bilateral arbitration&#8212;that a federal court determine (and the parties litigate) the legal requirements for success on the merits claim-by-claim and theory-by-theory, the evidence necessary to meet those requirements, the cost of developing that evidence, and the damages that would be recovered in the event of success. Such a preliminary litigating hurdle would undoubtedly destroy the prospect of speedy resolution that arbitration in general and bilateral arbitration in particular was meant to secure. The FAA does not sanction such a judicially created superstructure.</blockquote>The majority opinion was authored by Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Kagan argues that the majority opinion, "prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory rights." Justice Sonia Sotomayor was recused from the case.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-voting-rights.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in February. American Express argued that the enforceability of an arbitration agreement cannot be conditioned upon the availability of class certification. American Express further argued that "[t]he whole point of arbitration ... is to expand the scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be brought in an efficient and cost-effective manner" and that consumers could even share in the costs of experts. Kagan questioned whether preventing class action suits effectively foreclosed potential claimants from pursuing their claims because the amount of their individual damages was so small compared to the costs of bring even an arbitration suit that no one would actually bring a claim. However, Breyer questioned whether the expert reports required for arbitration really needed to be very expensive. The plaintiffs argued that American Express was using its market power to impose contractual terms that effectively made the arbitration of an antitrust claim impossible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 2009 law created an additional path to life imprisonment without parole for those sentenced to death row if they could prove that their sentence was racially motivated. To date, four men were able to successfully show that prejudice affected their criminal proceedings and were granted life in prison in lieu of a lethal injection. The <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina</a> [advocacy website], which helped represent all four recipients of commuted sentences, <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/index.php/blog/north-carolina-repeals-historic-racial-justice-act.html">stated</a> [press release] that the RJA gave the courts a chance to gain insight into the way race affects judicial bias and correct for it. McRory and supporters, however, maintain that the RJA was unnecessary because convicted prisoners still retain the right to appeal.

<p>Six US states have repealed the death penalty since 2008, bringing the total to 18. One of the common rationales for this trend is that the costs associated with litigating appeals actually cost the state more than paying for a prisoner's needs for life. Those states that recently joined this trend are <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/maryland-governor-signs-bill-repealing-death-penalty.php">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports].

Alliance for Open Society International, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the government cannot withhold funding from HIV/AIDS organizations that do not actively denounce prostitution. Under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-83">US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003</a> [22 USC &#167; 7601], Congress appropriated billions of dollars to fund efforts by nongovernmental organizations to assist in the fight against those diseases. The act provides, however, that no funds "may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking, and that no funds may be used by an organization "that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking." In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that the second requirement violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]:<blockquote>The Policy Requirement compels as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program. In so doing, it violates the First Amendment and cannot be sustained.</blockquote>Justice Elena Kagan took no part in consideration of the case.

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. According to Scalia, "This Policy Requirement is nothing more than a means of selecting suitable agents to implement the Government's chosen strategy to eradicate HIV/AIDS. That is perfectly permissible under the Constitution."

The first statute in question is a <a href="http://votesmart.org/static/billtext/33425.pdf">2011 law</a> [text, PDF] that limits the drugs that can be used in abortions. The second is a recent <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/north-dakota-abortion-law-challenged.php">statute</a> [JURIST report] that requires abortion providers to be affiliated with a hospital within <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0796-01000.pdf?20130516003146">30 miles of their practice</a> [text, PDF]. The cases were combined when the plaintiffs, backed by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-takes-legal-action-against-north-dakota-law-aimed-at-closi">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website], argued that both cases rely on the same legal and factual matters, as they both significantly effect the daily operations of abortions under state law. The only abortion clinic in the state, the <a href="http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com/">Red River Women's Clinic</a> [clinic website], is the plaintiff in both complaints, while the State is the defendant. The Center for Reproductive Rights stated:<blockquote>Because the court has already considered many of the facts about the safety and quality of care provided at the Red River Women's Clinic, we believe today's decision will expedite the litigation and ultimately result in both laws being permanently struck down as unconstitutional.</blockquote>Since the 2011 law came into effect, the state has already paid tens of thousands of dollars <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nd-judge-allows-new-complaint-abortion-lawsuit">defending it</a> [AP report]. Combining the lawsuits will save all parties time and significant amounts of public funds. 

<p>North Dakota has been at the forefront of <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">recent conflicts in abortion law</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/governor-jack-dalrymple">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] signed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Dalrymple also signed two other bills into law, <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0351-01000.pdf?20130516003227">HB 1305</a> and <a href="http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-0304-02000.pdf?20130516003209">HB 1456 </a>[text, PDF], along with the statute currently challenged. Both of those statutes create limitations on permissible motivations for abortions regarding the race or disabling condition of the fetus, similar to a law that was <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/arizona-ban-against-race-gender-based-abortions-challenged.php">recently challenged in Arizona</a>. The CRR is also planning challenges to those provisions. On Monday, the US House of Representatives approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] also banning abortions after 20 weeks, also based on the premise of fetal pain. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/english/">Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes</a> (CNIL) [official website] an independent oversight authority set up by the French government has <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/english/news-and-events/news/article/cnil-orders-google-to-comply-with-the-french-data-protection-act-within-three-months/">accused</a> [text] Google of breaching the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/fileadmin/documents/en/Act78-17VA.pdf">French Data Protection Act</a> [text, PDF, in French]. The group has given Google three months to change its consolidated private policy, which applies to all European nations and combines individuals' data across the entire spectrum of Google owned websites and services, or face a fine of up to &#8364;150,000. Also Thursday, Spain's Data Protection Agency, The <a href="http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/index-ides-idphp.php">Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos</a> (AEPD) [official website, in Spanish], released a <a href="http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/revista_prensa/revista_prensa/2013/notas_prensa/common/junio/130620_NP_PS_GOOGLE.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] accusing Google of committing five violations of the Spanish data protection law, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/20/google-privacy-idUSL5N0EW14X20130620">charge</a> [Reuters report] that would bring fines of between between &#8364;40,000 &#8364;and 300,000. The CNIL has stated that the data protection authorities from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK are all investigating similar privacy actions against Google. 

<p>Google has faced criticism for numerous privacy issues recently. Earlier this month a judge in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-rules-google-must-comply-with-national-security-letters.php">ruled</a> that Google must follow the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI's</a> [official website] warrantless requests for user information through <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/intel/RS22406.pdf">national security letters</a> (NSLs) [CRS backgrounder]. In April six European countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">commenced legal action</a> [JURIST report] against Google regarding its privacy policies. Also in April Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">agreed to a $7 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] for its collection of improper data during its Street View campaign. Last December an Italian appeals court overturned the conviction of three Google executives for <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">violating Italian privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by posting a video on Google of a handicapped child being bullied. Last June a Swiss court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/switzerland-court-partially-rules-for-google-in-privacy-case.php">ruled partially for Google</a> [JURIST report] in a privacy suit involving its Street View service. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to <em>The Guardian</em>, the two documents were submitted to the <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [FJC backgrounder] in 2009 by <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website]. One of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/20/exhibit-a-procedures-nsa-document">documents</a> [text] providing an overview of NSA procedure states:<blockquote>In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States person, a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is not known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be positively identified as a United States person.</blockquote>The second <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/20/exhibit-b-nsa-procedures-document">document</a> [text] outlines methods and procedures utilized by the NSA  to limit "acquisition, retention, use, and dissemination of non--publicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons" acquired by the NSA's targeting of non-United States persons. However, the document goes on to state that in the case of data involving unconsenting US persons, "such inadvertently acquired communication of or concerning a United States person may be retained no longer than five years in any event." Section 702 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.6304:">FISA Amendments Act</a> (FAA) [text] ratified in 2008 permits the NSA to collect large quantities of data mostly originating from foreign communications as well as calls made between the US and foreign nations.

<p>The revelations surrounding the NSA's surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top official have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Lawmakers have also called for a criminal investigation into the activities of Edward Snowden, who <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/nsa-secret-surveillance-lawmakers-live?INTCMP=SRCH">came forward</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] earlier this month as the whistleblower in the NSA surveillance scandal. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kenyatta and his deputy president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=william+ruto">William Ruto</a> [JURIST news archive] are charged with crimes against humanity for their alleged involvement in inciting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+election+violence">violence following the 2007 election</a> [JURIST news archive] which led to more than 1,100 deaths. Ruto's trial has been recently <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icc-postpones-trial-of-kenya-vice-president.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report], and Kenyatta's trial is now scheduled to commence on November 12.

<p>This is the most recent in the ongoing controversy surrounding the trials of Kenyatta and Ruto. In May African foreign ministers <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/african-leaders-to-request-icc-try-kenyan-leaders-in-kenya.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Kenyatta and Ruto by tried in Kenya instead of by the ICC after the <a href="http://www.tjrckenya.org/">Kenyan Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TJRC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-report-connects-president-vp-to-post-election-violence.php">report</a> [JURIST report] connecting Kenyatta and Ruto to the post-election violence. Earlier in May Kenya's ambassador to the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/kenya-un-ambassador-seeks-dismissal-of-icc-charges-against-president.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that the charges against Kenyatta be dismissed. In spite of Kenya's apparent eagerness to prosecute Kenyatta, Chief Prosecutor of the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/Pages/theprosecutor2012.aspx">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/icc-prosecutor-requires-proof-that-kenya-can-handle-kenyatta-case.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Kenya must prove its ability to handle the case before the ICC will drop the case. In April a judge overseeing Kenyatta's ICC case <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-judge-withdraws-from-case-against-kenya-president.php">requested to be excused</a> [JURIST report] from hearing the case. Even with charges for crimes against humanity pending against him, Kenyatta was able to <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/icc-indictee-kenyatta-sworn-in-as-fourth-president-of-kenya.php">win a controversial election</a> [JURIST report] to the presidency in March.

Svartholm Warg was found guilty of hacking into a company that handles sensitive information for Sweden's police force, the country's tax authority, and Nordic banking group Nordea AB, and also stealing money from an account in Denmark and trying to illegally transfer &#8364;654,000 (USD $863,000) of money in European accounts.

<p>Svartholm Warg was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/cambodia-to-deport-founder-of-pirate-bay-file-sharing-site.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Cambodia in 2012 after Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for him.

The court reversed the ruling by the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-rules-sudan-liable-in-uss.php">previous judgment</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/46C303.txt">Death on the High Seas Act</a> (DOHSA) precluded an action against the Republic of Sudan under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C97.txt">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> (FSIA) [texts]. The court reasoned that because the plaintiffs filed a new action directly under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1605A">28 USC &#167; 1605A</a> [text], the various provisions of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.1585:">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [text] governing how to apply &#167; 1605A retroactively to pending and previous actions were inapplicable to the case. Moreover, both the change in statutory law between the plaintiffs' initial complaint in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11343966041933657211&q=Rux+v.+Republic+of+Sudan+2004&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Rux v.

The Republic of Sudan</a> [opinions, PDF] and the substantial foreign and domestic policy concerns at issue justified an exception to the <em>res judicata</em> doctrine.

<p>US District Judge Robert Doumar <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/families-of-uss-cole-dead-can-sue.php">ruled</a> in 2005 that there was sufficient evidence for the families to pursue the lawsuit after the <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/families-of-uss-cole-dead-can-sue.php">first suit</a> [JURIST reports] was filed against Sudan in 2004. The families allege that Sudan helped finance the attack and allowed an al Qaeda operative to ship explosives to Yemen. To overcome the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/index.php/Sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] typically accorded a foreign country in US courts under the FSIA, the plaintiffs invoked that statute's exception for state sponsors of terrorism.

Oregon <a href="http://governor.oregon.gov/">Governor John Kitzhaber</a> [official website] in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/oregon-governor-puts-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">issued a temporary reprieve</a> [JURIST report] for death row inmate Gary Haugen, just before his scheduled execution, and called for an end to the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive]. Haugen, who had been convicted of two murders, then tried to seek his own death warrant, arguing that he did not want to live with the uncertainty of the indefinite reprieve. A lower court ruled for Haugen, but the Supreme Court rejected his arguments, finding that the governor's reprieve is valid and that it does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text]:<blockquote>We do not doubt that being on death row, awaiting possible execution, and facing uncertainty as to if, and when, that sentence might be carried out, exacts a toll on people, as at least some members of the Supreme Court have recognized. ... The Court has not concluded, however, that the uncertainty accompanying that time on death row constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Moreover, Haugen cites no case that suggests that a reprieve or other act of clemency qualifies as cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, we reject Haugen's Eighth Amendment challenge.</blockquote>Kitzhaber <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/oregon-death-row-inmate-cannot-reject-reprieve-court-003503355.html">welcomed the ruling</a> [Reuters report] and again called for a review of the state's capital punishment system.

<p>Six US states have repealed the death penalty since 2007, bringing the total to 18. One of the common rationales for this trend is that the costs associated with litigating appeals actually cost the state more than paying for a prisoner's needs for life. Those states that recently joined this trend are <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/maryland-governor-signs-bill-repealing-death-penalty.php">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports].

The law defines bullying that causes serious mental or physical harm as "serious." Under the new legislation, schools must <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/kyodo-news-international/130621/diet-enacts-law-aimed-at-preventing-bullying-at-school">report serious cases</a> [Kyodo News report] to the appropriate governmental bodies and set up investigative panels. The law also requires the government to monitor for online bullying activity. The bill was passed in response to a series of bullying incidents in Japan, including a 2011 case that resulted in a student committing suicide. The legislation has already been approved the lower house, the <a href="http://www.shugiin.go.jp/index.nsf/html/index_e.htm">House of Representatives</a> [official website].

This approval comes following an <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Korman-order-6-12-13.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-approves-fda-emergency-contraceptive-plan.php">report</a>] issued last week by Judge Edward Korman of the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website], who has been overseeing the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Plan+B">Plan B litigation</a> [JURIST news archive] for more than six years. Korman ruled that the FDA's plan to approve Plan B was acceptable despite the fact that <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/response-to-FDA-on-Plan-B-6-12-13.pdf">opposing parties argued it was not broad enough</a> [text, PDF]. Women's rights groups argued that the FDA restricted access to only the name-brand, one-pill product, leaving generic and two-pill options unavailable to women of lesser means. In his approval of the FDA's plan, the judge reiterated several times that he expects alternative emergency contraceptives to be approved without delay. 

<p>Originally, when the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-judge-rules-emergency-contraceptive-is-for-all-ages.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of increasing the availability of Plan B, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/about/biography/">Katherine Sebelius, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services</a> [official website], intervened to block the sale of such pharmaceuticals to minors. Birth control, especially emergency contraceptives like Plan B, has been the target of social stigma, which the judge <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-block-emergency-contraceptive-order.php">found to be the only cause</a> [JURIST report] for the Department's intervention. Only days before the FDA's presentation of its approval plan to the judge, it announced that the Department of Justice would <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/doj-drops-appeal-of-plan-b-contraceptive-ruling.">not seek to appeal</a> the judge's decision, despite the Obama administration's <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/obama-administration-urges-review-of-plan-b-ruling.php">renewed promises</a> [JURIST reports] to restrain minor's access to emergency contraceptives. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] The US government has charged former government contractor Edward Snowden with espionage for leaking top secret documents, according to a sealed <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/716888/u-s-vs-edward-j-snowden-criminal-complaint.pdf">criminal complaint</a> [opinion, PDF] filed in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website]. The complaint charges Snowden with unauthorized communication of national defense information, theft of government property, and willful communication of classified intelligence information. Each of these crimes falls under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text profile] and carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The charges arise from Snowden's <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/nsa-collecting-phone-call-data-under-top-secret-court-order.php">disclosure</a> [JURIST report] of US <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] documents detailing telephone and Internet surveillance efforts to the <em>Washington Post</em> and Britain's <em>Guardian</em> newspaper. Snowden is thought to be in Hong Kong, and the US has pledged to seek his extradition.

The revelations surrounding the NSA's surveillance programs have sparked worldwide debate and controversy. Last week the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-nsa-surveillance-measures.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the NSA challenging its recently revealed phone data collection. Although the president and top official have defended the surveillance as a lawful counterterrorism measure, several US lawmakers have <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-lawmakers-urge-review-of-government-surveillance-activities.php">called for a review</a> [JURIST report] of the government's surveillance activity in light of recent reports revealing phone and Internet monitoring. Snowden is a 29-year-old former CIA technical worker that accessed the surveillance files when he was contracted as a civilian to work on projects for the NSA. He stated in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em> that he released the material because he believed the surveillance violated the right to privacy.]]></content:encoded>

The bill will need approval from the upper house and <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website], processes that are often times considered formalities, before it becomes law. Duma Deputy Speaker Sergei Zheleznyak <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22955143">defended the bill</a> [BBC report] as a means of protecting children. Late last year Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">banned Americans</a> [BBC report] from adopting Russian children, which may have been in retaliation for the enactment of the <a href="/forum/2012/04/david-crane-magnitsky.php">Magnitsky Act</a> [JURIST op-ed]. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+adoption">Same-sex adoption rights</a> [JURIST news archive] have created controversy worldwide. Last month <a href="http://www.en.parlamento.pt/">Portugal's Parliament</a> [official website] voted to approve a law <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/portugal-expands-adoption-rights-for-same-sex-couples.php">allowing same-sex married couples to adopt</a> [JURIST report] their partners' children. In February Puerto Rico's Supreme Court upheld a law banning same-sex couples from adopting children. Earlier that week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a woman in a same-sex relationship could <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/europe-rights-court-rules-austrian-woman-can-adopt-child-of-same-sex-partner.php">adopt her partner's biological child</a> [JURIST report]. Also in February the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled that same-sex couples in a civil union <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/germany-court-allows-same-sex-parents-to-adopt-partners-non-biological-children.php">can legally adopt</a> [JURIST report] the non-biological children of their partners. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/pages/default.aspx">Northern Ireland High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/northern-ireland-high-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in October that a law permitting adoption only by heterosexual married couples or single individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, is unlawful. Also in October, the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/civil.cfm">Alabama Court of Civil Appeals</a> [official website] upheld a law limiting marriage as a union between and one man and one woman. That ruling effectively <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alabama-court-rules-woman-cannot-adopt-same-sex-partners-child.php">barred a woman from adopting her female partner's child</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since <a href="http://www.kansas.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/kansas-governor-signs-anti-abortion-bill-into-law.php">signed the legislation</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/">Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri</a> (PPKM) [advocacy website], the plaintiff in the suit, denounced the law as an extreme governmental intrusion on women's reproductive rights. Peter Brownlie, President and CEO of PPKM, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/planned-parenthood-challenges-requirement-publicly-endorse-states-anti-abortion-ideology-41529.htm">stated</a> [press release], "For government officials to force individuals and organizations to publicly endorse the state's views violates the fundamental principles on which our country is founded." The new Kansas law is set to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/20/planned-parenthood-lawsuit/2443059/">take effect next month</a> [AP report]. 

<p>Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in favor of a <a href="http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1797">bill</a> [HR 1797] that would ban most abortions after <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-house-votes-for-20-week-abortion-ban.php">20 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. The bill passed by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll251.xml">228-196</a> [roll call vote] mainly along party lines. Additionally, a number of states have recently passed restrictive laws relating to <a href="/feature/2013/06/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In April North Dakota <a href="http://governor.nd.gov/">Governor Jack Dalrymple</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">signed a measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks gestation based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Earlier that month lawmakers in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/alabama-lawmakers-strengthen-restrictions-on-abortion-clinics.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2013rs/PrintFiles/HB57-int.pdf">Women's Health and Safety Act</a> [text, PDF] which imposes tough restrictions on abortion clinics and practitioners within the state. In March the Arkansas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/arkansas-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-12-week-abortion-ban.php">voted to override</a> [JURIST report] Governor Mike Beebe's recent veto of the Arkansas <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2013/2013R/Bills/SB134.pdf">Human Heartbeat Protection Act</a> [Act 301, PDF], which bans abortions "of an unborn human individual whose heartbeat has been detected ... and is twelve (12) weeks or greater gestation." That law has since been <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-12-week-abortion-ban.php">blocked by a federal judge</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court has yet to provide a date for when it will issue its final ruling in the lawsuit, which is expected to include information about a potential damages award amount. Samsung said that company planned to review the ruling and then <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/tokyo-court-backs-apple-against-samsung-patent-133030423.html">decide whether to appeal</a> [AP report].</p>

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in patent litigation in courts around the world. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-trade-commission-rules-for-samsung-in-apple-patent-dispute.php">issued a limited import ban</a> [JURIST report] and a cease-and-desist-order against Apple for AT&#38;T models of the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad 3G, and iPad 2 3G after finding the devices violated a patent held by Samsung Electronics. In March, a UK court ruled in favor of Apple in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/uk-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-infringement-case.php">involving three patents</a> [JURIST reports] in connection to data and information transfer technology that Samsung alleged Apple infringed. In February the <a href=" http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-apple-request-to-block-samsung-sales.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] by Apple to ban sales of Samsung Galaxy Nexus smartphone based on allegations of willful patent infringements. In January, the <a href=" http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6410">District Court of The Hague</a> [official website] ruled that the designs of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1, 8.9 and 7.7 do <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/dutch-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">not infringe</a> [JURIST reports] designs patented by Apple.  <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmorocco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Moroccan courts are relying too heavily on coerced confessions and delaying trial proceedings, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/morocco0613webwcover.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] Friday, calling for reform of the country's judicial system. The 131-page report, entitled "Just Sign Here: Unfair Trials Based on Confessions to the Police in Morocco," examines numerous cases in which the judicial system violated due process by allowing confessions into evidence amid defendants' claims that such confessions were obtained through police abuse. Additionally, the report discusses the lengthy delays in the justice system, with some individuals waiting years in pre-trial detention for their cases to be heard. The report urges Morocco to "diligently examine any claims made by defendants that the police obtained their self-incriminating statements by force or coercion" and to "end the practice of unduly prolonged pretrial detention of defendants and conduct trials with reasonable promptness."

<p>Morocco has had a controversial human rights record during its government's transition away from a highly centralized monarchy. In September <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/SRTortureIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on torture</a> [official website] Juan Mendez said after a visit to Morocco that the human rights situation in the country is improving but that more effort is needed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-morocco-must-work-to-eradicate-torture.php">eradicate torture</a> [JURIST report]. Also in September HRW urged Morocco to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-calls-on-morocco-to-release-jailed-activists.php">release five prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who were allegedly convicted based on false confessions obtained through torture. In July Moroccan voters overwhelmingly approved a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/morocco-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-revised-constitution.php">revised version of the constitution</a> [JURIST report], highlighted by fewer powers reserved for their king. The constitutional revisions were a product of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/morocco-king-announces-plans-for-constitutional-reform.php">reform process announced</a> last April following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST reports] demanding democratic reforms as part of the wider protests in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=middle+east+protest">news archive</a>]. Commentators state that Morocco has continued to move forward in improving human rights but that it still has a <a href="/hotline/2012/02/leila-hanafi-morocco-icc.php">duty to ratify</a> [JURIST op-ed] the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/STATUTE/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], the founding treaty of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Baderin acknowledged the significant improvement in access to humanitarian aid in government-controlled areas. However, the expert noted that the rebel-controlled areas "continue to deteriorate as a result of the belligerent activities of the parties to the conflict. I have also been informed that many displaced and vulnerable civilians have been forced to move further south without access to basic necessities such as water and food." He stated that the living conditions in the internally displaced person camps were particularly terrible for women and children. Baderin once again urged the government to protect citizens' freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, along with the freedom of the press. "These rights are integral to the creation of an enabling environment that allow for civic participation in the country, where all citizens are free to express their view without fear of reprisals from authorities."

<p>There has been significant international attention surrounding the human rights violations in Sudan. Ali Kosheib, former militia leader wanted by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for crimes against humanity and war crimes in West Darfur in 2003 and 2004, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-suspect-seen-at-new-sudan-crime-scenes-hrw.php">spotted in an attack </a>[JURIST report] against Salamat communities in Central <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive] in April. Deputy commander of the JEM-Bashar <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050309/Pages/icc02050309.aspx">Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus</a> [ICC case summary], also wanted by the ICC, was reportedly killed in Northern Darfur in April. Jamus was charged in connection with an attack on <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] Peace Keepers in September 2007 at <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7032613.stm">Haskanita</a> [BBC backgrounder], which resulted in the death of 12 peacekeepers. Despite the loss of high-profile leaders, fighting in Sudan has continued as the trials of leaders move forward. In December the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icc-un-security-council-must-do-more-in-darfur.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] the UN to do more in Darfur. In October a UN rights office <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sudan to investigate an ambush on a UN convoy.

Under the terms of the <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c39/774312.html">new bill</a> [Itar-Tass report], failure to remove site content suspected of infringement within 72 hours would result in the entire site being blocked by ISPs pending the outcome of a court hearing by the <A href=" http://moscow.ru/en/government/capital_russia/judicial_authority/city_moscow_court/">Moscow City Court</a> [official website]. The legislation has received intense opposition from <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href=" http://corp.mail.ru/en">Mail.Ru Group</a> [corporate websites], the <a href=" http://raec.ru/en/about/">Russian Association of Electronic Communications</a> [website, in Russian] and <a href=" http://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a> [corporate website], Russia's biggest search engine. Once upper house and presidential approval is obtained, the law is expected to come into effect on August 1.

<p>Various countries have struggled in recent years with Internet piracy, adopting varying measures to solve the problem. Last year the Spanish government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">approved a new law</a> [JURIST report] that created a government agency with the authority to force ISPs to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyright materials. In 2011, the Somali parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/somalia-parliament-rejects-anti-piracy-legislation.php">rejected legislation</a> [JURIST report] designed to combat piracy by criminalizing piracy and improving internal mechanism for trying alleged offenders. In 2010 the Irish High Court ruled that the country does <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ireland-court-finds-no-anti-piracy-laws-authorizing-suspension-of-internet-service.php">not recognize any laws</a> [JURIST report] that would allow ISPs to suspend service to customers suspected of Internet piracy. In 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/france-constitutional-court-approves.php">France approved</a> [JURIST report] an Internet piracy law that restricts access for individuals who use the Internet to violate intellectual property laws. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As a term of the deal reached between Skilling and the government, more than $40 million of Skilling's fortune, which has been frozen since his conviction in 2006, will be distributed to victims of Enron's collapse. Lead defense attorney Daniel Petrocelli anticipates that with time already served and other reductions, including a standard 15 percent sentence reduction for good behavior and a one-year reduction for completing an alcohol-abuse treatment program, that Skilling could be released in four years. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/about/aag.html ">Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman</a> [official website] issued stated that Skilling's sentence reduction still "imposes significant punishment."

<p>A jury <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-jury-finds-lay-skilling.php">convicted Skilling</a> [JURIST report] in May 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in maintaining a face of success as Enron's energy business crumbled. In 2009 a federal appeals court ruled that Lake had improperly applied a sentencing guideline, which meant a reduction in Skilling's original prison sentence. In February 2009 the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/fifth-circuit-denies-enron-ex-ceo.php">denied</a> a petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing for Skilling after a <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fifth-circuit-upholds-convictions-of.php">three-judge panel upheld</a> [JURIST reports] his previous convictions and ordered him to be resentenced due to error in the lower court. Skilling's appeal was based on a previous <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">Fifth Circuit ruling</a> [JURIST report] that overturned convictions for other Enron executives based on "honest services theft" because they had acted in Enron's best interest by direction and did not profit from their actions. In 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled that the "honest services" doctrine is <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">not unconstitutionally vague</a> [JURIST report] under a limited construction of the statute, and the district court adequately "detected and diffused" juror prejudiced in the pre-trial publicity of Skilling. From 2009 until Friday's ruling, Skilling's resentencing attempts were delayed as he sought to overturn his convictions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1281.htm">NLRB v. Noel Canning</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NLRBvNoelCanningPet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide: (1) whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised during a recess that occurs within a session of the Senate or is instead limited to recesses that occur between enumerated sessions of the Senate; and (2) whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised to fill vacancies that exist during a recess or is instead limited to vacancies that first arose during that recess. In addition to these questions, the court has directed the parties to brief and argue the following question: whether the president's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in <em>pro forma</em> sessions. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-finds-obama-recess-appointments-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in January that the recess appointment of three members of the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] by President Barack Obama was unconstitutional, and the government <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/obama-petitions-supreme-court-on-recess-appointments.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report].

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1168.htm">McCullen v. Coakley</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/12-____-McCullen-v.-Coakley-S.-Ct.-cert.-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider a Massachusetts law that establishes "buffer zones" for abortion clinics. The <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ma/buffer-zone-law-info-for-patients-18525.htm">buffer zone</a> [Planned Parenthood backgrounder] creates a protected area outside of the abortion clinic where people are not allowed to protest. This is meant to ensure potential patients safe passage into the facilities. The law creates a 35-foot buffer zone on the driveways and entrances to the facilities. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/federal-appeals-court-upholds-massachusetts-abortion-clinic-buffer-zone.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report] in January. The questions before the court are (1) whether the First Circuit erred in upholding Massachusetts' selective exclusion law under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, on its face and as applied to petitioners; and (2) if <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13410055345323866526&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Hill v. Colorado</a> [opinion] permits enforcement of this law, whether <span class="casename">Hill</span> should be limited or overruled.</p>

<p>In the consolidated cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1182.htm">Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2012-1182.pet_.aa_.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1183.htm">American Lung Association v.

The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-epa-in-cross-state-pollution-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last August that the EPA overstepped its authority because its regulation, known as the Transport Rule, did not square with Congress' intention to have individual states, rather than the EPA, set emissions policies to meet federal standards. The questions before the court are (1) whether the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the challenges on which it granted relief; (2) whether states are excused from adopting state implementation plan (SIPs) prohibiting emissions that "contribute significantly" to air pollution problems in other states until after the EPA has adopted a rule quantifying each state's interstate pollution obligations; and (3) whether the EPA permissibly interpreted the statutory term "contribute significantly" so as to define each upwind state's "significant" interstate air pollution contributions in light of the cost-effective emission reductions it can make to improve air quality in polluted downwind areas, or whether the act instead unambiguously requires the EPA to consider only each upwind State's physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind air quality problem.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-99.htm">Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-99-Mulhall-cert-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether an employer and union may violate <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/186">&#167; 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act</a>, [29 USC &#167; 186] by entering into an agreement under which the employer exercises its freedom of speech by promising to remain neutral to union organizing, its property rights by granting union representatives limited access to the employer's property and employees, and its freedom of contract by obtaining the union's promise to forgo its rights to picket, boycott, or otherwise put pressure on the employer's business. &#167; 302 makes it a crime for an employer "to pay, lend, or deliver ... any money or other thing of value" to a labor union that seeks to represent its employees, and prohibits the labor union from receiving the same. The US Courts of Appeals for the Third and Fourth Circuits have held that agreements between employers and unions that set ground rules for union organizing campaigns are not "payment" of "things of value" prohibited by &#167; 302. In this case, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reached the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2372867234617773781&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">opposite conclusion</a> [opinion].</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-515.htm">Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/12-515-Bay-Mills-cert-petition_10-23-12.pdf.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider (1) whether a federal court has jurisdiction to enjoin activity that violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29">Indian Gaming Regulatory Act</a> (IGRA) [25 USC &#167; 2701 et seq.] but takes place outside of Indian lands; and (2) whether tribal sovereign immunity bars a state from suing in federal court to enjoin a tribe from violating IGRA outside of Indian lands. In this case the state of Michigan and the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians brought suit to prevent the Bay Mills Indian Community from operating a small casino in Vanderbilt, Michigan. The district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering Bay Mills to stop gaming at the Vanderbilt casino. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9953145219381999588&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">held</a> [opinion] that the district court lacked jurisdiction over some of the plaintiffs' claims, and that sovereign immunity bars the others.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-820.htm">Lozano v. Alvarez</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Hunton-Lozano-Petition-for-a-Writ-for-a-Certiorari-c.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether a district court considering a petition under the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=69">Hague Convention</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hague+convention">news archive</a>] for the return of an abducted child may equitably toll the running of the one-year filing period when the abducting parent has concealed the whereabouts of the child from the left-behind parent. While the US Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits all hold the one-year period may be equitably tolled, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8070334288395403873&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">held</a> [opinion] in this case that the one-year period is not subject to equitable tolling and the settled defense is still available even where, as here, the abducting parent conceals the location of the child.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-930.htm">Mayorkas v. Cuellar de Osorio</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2012-0930.pet_.aa_.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide (1) whether 8 USC &#167; 1153(h)(3) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text] unambiguously grants relief to all aliens who qualify as "child" derivative beneficiaries at the time a visa petition is filed but age out of qualification by the time the visa becomes available to the primary beneficiary; and (2) whether the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [official website] reasonably interpreted &#167; 1153(h)(3). The INA permits US citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens to petition for certain family members to obtain visas to immigrate to the US or to adjust their status in the US to that of a lawful permanent resident alien. The family member sponsored by the petitioner is known as the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary's "spouse or child" may be a derivative beneficiary of the petition, "entitled to the same status[] and the same order of consideration" as the primary beneficiary. &#167; 1153(h)(3), grants relief to certain persons who reach age 21 and therefore lose "child" status after the filing of visa petitions as to which they are beneficiaries. Here the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9574440486125736597&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">held</a> [opinion] that "the plain language of [&#167; 1153(h)] unambiguously grants automatic conversion and priority date retention to aged-out derivative beneficiaries. The BIA's interpretation of the statute conflicts with the plain language of [&#167; 1153(h)], and it is not entitled to deference."</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1200.htm">Executive Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/EBIA-Cert-Petition-Final.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider a bankruptcy case. In <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-narrows-bankruptcy-judge-jurisdiction.php">Stern v. Marshall</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court held that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III of the US Constitution</a> [text] precludes Congress from assigning certain "core" bankruptcy proceedings involving private state law rights to adjudication by non-Article III bankruptcy judges. Applying <span class="casename">Stern</span>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10911566478125268142&q=Executive+Benefits+Insurance+Agency,+Inc.+v.+Arkison&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">held</a> [opinion] that a fraudulent conveyance action is subject to Article III. The court further held, in conflict with the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, that the Article III problem had been waived by petitioner's litigation conduct, which the court of appeals construed as implied consent to entry of final judgment by the bankruptcy court. The court of appeals also held, in conflict with the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, that a bankruptcy court may issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to a district court's <em>de novo</em> review, in "core" bankruptcy proceedings where Article III precludes the bankruptcy court from entering final judgment. The questions before the court are: (1) whether Article III permits the exercise of the judicial power of the US by bankruptcy courts on the basis of litigant consent, and, if so, whether "implied consent" based on a litigant's conduct, where the statutory scheme provides the litigant no notice that its consent is required, is sufficient to satisfy Article III; and (2) whether a bankruptcy judge may submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for <em>de novo</em> review by a district court in a "core" proceeding under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/157">28 USC &#167; 157(b)</a> [text].</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1208.htm">UBS v. Union de Empleados</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/UBS-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide whether the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit should have reviewed for abuse of discretion the district court's determination, pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23.1">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1</a> [text], that the particularized facts alleged in a shareholder derivative complaint were insufficient to excuse a presuit demand on the corporation's board of directors. A shareholder derivative action permits a shareholder of a corporation to bring suit to enforce rights the corporation is unable or unwilling to enforce on its own behalf, but the shareholder must state with particularity in the complaint either that the corporation declined to protect its own interests after suitable demand  or that such a demand would have been futile. In this case, plaintiffs brought a shareholder derivative action against UBS Trust and UBS Financial, who moved to dismiss plaintiffs' claims. The district court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that no presuit demand had been made and plaintiffs had failed to state with particularity the reasons such a demand would have been futile. The First Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11049546174843219658&q=Uni%C3%B3n+De+Empleados+De+Muelles+De+Puerto+Rico+PRSSA+Welfare+Plan+v.+UBS+Financial+Servs.+Inc&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">vacated the dismissal</a> [opinion] of the derivative claims and remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<p>Also Monday the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-1084_ap6c.pdf">issued a <em>per curiam</em> decision</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1084.htm">Ryan v. Schad</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Ryan-v-Schad-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. In this death penalty case, the court held that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion by not issuing its mandate under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_41">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D)</a> [text] after the Supreme Court previously rejected a petition for <em>certiorari</em>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

University of Texas at Austin</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">report</a>] that the appeals court did not apply the correct standard in upholding a ruling for the university in an affirmative action challenge. Petitioner Abigail Noel Fisher, a Caucasian student, was denied undergraduate admission to University of Texas at Austin (UT) in 2008 and subsequently challenged the admissions policy, which allows the university to consider race and ethnicity during admissions processing. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in 2011 that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-appeals-court-upholds-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">policy did not violate</a> [JURIST report] Fisher's rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights statutes, affirming a lower court decision which granted summary judgment to UT.

Bollinger</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/forum/symposium-aa/index-printer.php">symposium</a>] and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4987623155291151023&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</a> [opinion], its decision affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment to UT was incorrect:<blockquote>Strict scrutiny must not be "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." ... But the opposite is also true. Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judicial review to be meaningful, a university must make a showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the only interest that this Court has approved in this context: the benefits of a student body diversity that "encompasses a ... broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element."</blockquote>In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court vacated the Fifth Circuit's ruling and remanded the case. Justice Elena Kagan was recused.

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a concurring opinion, noting that he adheres to his view articulated in <span class="casename">Grutter</span>: "The Constitution proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and state-provided education is no exception." However, since the petitioner did not ask the court to overrule <span class="casename">Grutter</span>'s holding, he joined the opinion in full. Justice Clarence Thomas also wrote a separate concurrence to explain why he would overrule <span class="casename">Grutter</span>. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a lone dissent&#8212;she would have affirmed the Fifth Circuit's ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bartlett</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that generic drug <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/design_defect">design defect claims</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-993">PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-holds-federal-law-preempts-in-generic-drug-cases.php">report</a>]. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the court, which reversed the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's ruling that federal law does not preempt state law design defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conflict can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals stop making their products. The court found that this "stop selling" rationale was inconsistent with the court's preemption jurisprudence:<blockquote>Our preemption cases presume that an actor seeking to satisfy both his federal- and state-law obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to avoid liability. Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility preemption would be all but meaningless. The incoherence of the stop-selling theory becomes plain when viewed through the lens of our previous cases. In every instance in which the Court has found impossibility preemption, the "direct conflict" between federal- and state-law duties could easily have been avoided if the regulated actor had simply ceased acting.</blockquote>The court asserted that adopting the First Circuit's "stop selling" rationale would mean that not only <span class="casename">PLIVA</span>, but also the vast majority&#8212;if not all&#8212;of the cases in which the court has found impossibility preemption, were wrongly decided. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a separate dissent, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-claims-against-injury-by-generic-drugs.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. Attorneys for Mutual Pharmaceuticals argued, "[r]egardless of whether a state tort claim is captioned 'failure to warn,' 'design defect,' or something else entirely, these courts have recognized that the Constitution requires state law to yield if it would obligate a generic drug manufacturer to violate the federal sameness mandate." Conversely, attorneys for Karen Bartlett argued that impossibility does not apply, because if a jury found design defect in a generic drug, the manufacturer of that drug has the option to stop selling the drug, which makes the issue distinct for the brand-name's selling of the drug. JURIST Guest Columnist Daniel Perrone <a href="/dateline/2013/04/daniel-perrone-generic-drugs.php">argued recently</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the decision in <span class="casename">PLIVA</span> to insulate generic drug manufacturers from liability, despite their failure to adequately and safely label their products, is "an injustice that disproportionately affects those who cannot afford to purchase expensive brand-name drugs." He argued that "courts should craft an exception to the <span class="casename">PLIVA</span> rule that would hold generic drug manufacturers liable for their failure to adequately and safely label their products where the brand-name and generic drug manufacturers are one and the same."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rajaratnam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> in 2011 on 14 counts related to insider trading and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 11 years in prison, as well as over $63 million dollars in associated fines and fees. Rajaratnam <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/2012.01.25-apellant-brief.pdf">argued</a> [brief, PDF] that certain statements made by federal officers in the affidavit used in support of the warrant to tap his personal cell phone were made with a blatant disregard for the truth, and as such should have been suppressed under the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6436964399753145533&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Franks v. Delaware</a> [opinion] standard provided by the Supreme Court in 1978. Secondly, Rajaratnam argued that the jury instructions defining criminal use of material stock information in decisions to trade stock did not meet the "knowing possession" requirement for conviction. Writing for the court, Judge Jose Cabranes rejected both arguments on appeal.

<p>Rajaratnam's case has been called the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history, and his sentence is the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/October11/rajaratnamrajsentencingpr.pdf">longest term ever imposed for insider trading</a> [DOJ press release]. The 11-year sentence was significantly lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the 19 1/2-year minimum indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence. Several other defendants from leading international companies have <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty in connection with the case</a> [JURIST report].

Justice Samuel Alito, writing for a 5-4 majority in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/vance-v-ball-state-university/">Vance v. Ball State University</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-employer-liability-for-employee-harassment.php">report</a>], <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that an employee is considered a "supervisor" under Title VII only if she is empowered by the employer to make tangible employment actions against the victim. Under Title VII, an employer may be held vicariously liable for the discriminatory actions of an employee if the unlawful actions were done by a "supervisor." The <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website], the agency established by Congress to interpret and enforce Title VII, has defined "supervisor" as an employee who wields authority "of sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment." However, the majority rejected the "nebulous definition" advocated by the EEOC in favor of a narrow, less complex definition that will be more easily administrable. In her dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated:<blockquote>Trumpeting the virtues of simplicity and administrability, the Court restricts supervisor status to those with power to take tangible employment actions. In so restricting the definition of supervisor, the Court once again shuts from sight the robust protection against workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII to secure.</blockquote>The Court also <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf">split</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar/">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-final-arguments-of-term.php">report</a>]. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, vacated a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and held that retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation. The Fifth Circuit upheld a jury verdict in favor of Dr. Nassar, who claimed that he was retaliated against due to his earlier complaint alleging discrimination. Title VII, as amended in 1991, requires that plaintiffs bringing status-based claims of discrimination, claims based on race, sex, color, religion or national origin, may prove discrimination by showing that motivation to discriminate was at least one of the employer's motives. However, the Supreme Court, by analyzing the statutory language and structure, held that this provision does not apply to claims of retaliation. Instead "retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation ... that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer." Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented from the majority opinion. 

<p>In a statement from the bench, Ginsburg stated that Monday's rulings in <span class="casename">Vance</span> and <span class="casename">Nassar</span> dilute the strength of Title VII, and Congress must once again correct the court's interpretation of the law. Ginsburg also wrote a dissent to the 2007 case <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/supreme-court-limits-gender-pay.php">Lilly Ledbetter v. Goodyear</a> [JURIST report], a ruling that limited a victim's ability to bring suit over gender pay discrimination. In 2009 President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-signs-bill-clarifying-equal-pay.php">signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law</a> [JURIST report], which effectively overturned the 2007 Supreme Court decision.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

No one here claims that these changes are unreasonable or that Congress could not reasonably have found them "necessary and proper" means for furthering its preexisting registration ends.

<p>We conclude that the SORNA changes as applied to Kebodeaux fall within the scope Congress' authority under the Military Regulation and Necessary and Proper Clauses.</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts filed a concurring opinion, saying that the majority's discussion of the general public safety benefits of the registration requirement is "beside the point in this case." Justice Samuel Alito also filed a concurring opinion. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas filed dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-right-to-remain-silent.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. The deputy Solicitor General argued that "Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies for past violations of Federal law. The Ex Post Facto Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but no <em>per se</em> rule bars Congress from applying sex offender registration requirements, which this Court has held to be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause to past Federal criminal convictions." An attorney on behalf of Anthony James Kebodeaux argued that the situation should be analyzed under the five factors in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">United States v. Comstock</a> [JURIST report]. She also argued that under "necessary and proper" analysis, the government's requirement of registration here is beyond the scope of that power. "I don't see any problem with them giving notice. That does not impose a Federal obligation on an individual. So there is no power being exerted on the individual."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to seven years in prison and barred him from public office for life. A panel of three judges found Berlusconi guilty of paying then 17-year-old dancer Karima "Ruby" El Mahroug for sex while he was in office and for <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">abusing his power</a> [JURIST report] by asking police to release her when she was being detained for an unrelated crime. Both Berlusconi and El Mahroug <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12083491">denied the charges</a> [BBC report]. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SilvioBerlusconi">statement</a> [Facebook page] following the conviction, Berlusconi said that he believed the ruling is politically motivated and that he intends "to resist this persecution" and "will not in any way give up [his] battle to make Italy truly free and fair." The sentence will not become final until Berlusconi has fully exhausted his right to appeal. 

<p>Berlusconi has been at the center of several political scandals. Last month Italian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/italy-prosecutors-accuse-berlusconi-of-bribing-senator.php">accused </a> [JURIST report] Berlusconi of having paid former senator Sergio De Gregorio &#8364;3 million following the parliamentary election in 2006 to defect from the small <a href="http://www.italiadeivalori.it/">Italy of Values</a> [party website, in Italian] party and join the center right. Prosecutors want De Gregorio, who has admitted to taking money, to stand trial alongside Berlusconi. Also last month a Milan appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/italy-appeals-court-upholds-berlusconi-tax-fraud-conviction.php">upheld a previous conviction</a> [JURIST report] on tax evasion charges and affirmed Berlusconi's four-year prison sentence. In March, Berlusconi was found guilty and <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/jurist-a-milan-appeals-court.php">sentenced to a year in prison</a> [JURIST report] for publicly releasing private wiretaps in 2005. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution emphasizes more consistent and rigorous <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45253&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=conflict#.UcjI7fmshkU">investigation and prosecution</a> [press release] of sexual violence crimes as a central aspect of deterrence, and ultimately prevention. The resolution also calls for the further deployment of Women Protection Advisers (WPA) in accordance with an earlier <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1888(2009)">resolution</a> [Resolution 1888, PDF] to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security, and for the systematic assessment of the number and roles of WPAs during the planning and review of each UN peacekeeping and political mission. In an e-mailed statement, the <a href="http://www.coalitionfortheicc.org/">Coalition for the International Criminal Court</a> (CICC) [advocacy website] lauded the resolution, but called on the UNSC to use its leadership to ensure that governments, UN bodies and all who can play a decisive part in the arrest and surrender of alleged perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence, fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/icc/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website].

<p>The UN has recently focused on the issue of violence against women in a variety of contexts and countries. <br />
Last month the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-expert-calls-on-bangladesh-to-address-pervasive-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/">Bangladesh</a> [official website] to address the prevalent acts of violence against women occurring in the country. In March more than 130 UN member states <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-member-nations-adopt-plan-to-end-violence-against-women.php">agreed to adopt new measures</a> [JURIST report] to prevent and eliminate violence against women. This agreement came as a result of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-officials-encourage-reform-on-international-womens-day.php">UN urging</a> [JURIST report] governments to take decisive measures to protect women's rights. In December the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-afghanistan-women-still-suffering-abuse-from-men.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] declaring that women in Afghanistan are still suffering abuse at the hands of men. In November the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] that called for a global ban on female genital mutilation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-voting-rights.php">report</a>] that section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] is unconstitutional, and its formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance. Section 5 of the VRA requires jurisdictions with a history of preventing minority groups from voting to receive preclearance from the US <a href="http://justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> or a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official websites] before making any changes to their voting laws. Section 4 provides a formula for determining which jurisdictions are covered under section 5. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court struck down Section 4:<blockquote>Striking down an Act of Congress "is the gravest and most delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform." ... We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009, we took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead resolved the case then before us on statutory grounds. But in issuing that decision, we expressed our broader concerns about the constitutionality of the Act. Congress could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but did not do so. Its failure to act leaves us today with no choice but to declare &#167;4(b) unconstitutional. The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance.</blockquote>Roberts noted that the court's ruling does not affect "the permanent, nationwide ban on racial discrimination in voting found in &#167;2." He also clarified that the court has issued no ruling on the constitutionality of section 5 and that "Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions."

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Thomas would have struck down section 5 based on the same reasoning the court used to strike section 4. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. According to Ginsburg, Congress, and not the Court should decide whether section 5 "remains justifiable." Congress voted in 2006 to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/bush-signs-bill-extending-voting.php">extend the VRA</a> [JURIST report] for another 25 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Baby Girl</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that &#167;1912(f) and &#167;1912(d) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-21">Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978</a> (ICWA) do not bar the termination of the biological father's parental rights. In this case, a woman put her baby, who was fathered by an American Indian, up for adoption. A South Carolina couple attempted to adopt the child, but once the biological father was notified about the adoption proceedings, he attempted to gain custody. The South Carolina Supreme Court <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8759635594638469519&q=398+S.C.+625&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">ruled for the biological father</a> [opinion], stating that the federal ICWA, which seeks to keep American Indian children in their ethnic communities, preempts South Carolina law. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court reversed that decision:<blockquote>Contrary to the State Supreme Court's ruling, we hold that 25 USC &#167;1912(f )&#8212;which bars involuntary termination of a parent's rights in the absence of a heightened showing that serious harm to the Indian child is likely to result from the parent's "continued custody" of the child&#8212;does not apply when, as here, the relevant parent never had custody of the child. We further hold that &#167;1912(d)&#8212;which conditions involuntary termination of parental rights with respect to an Indian child on a showing that remedial efforts have been made to prevent the "breakup of the Indian family"&#8212;is inapplicable when, as here, the parent abandoned the Indian child before birth and never had custody of the child. Finally, we clarify that &#8212;1915(a), which provides placement preferences for the adoption of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian family like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child when no other eligible candidates have sought to adopt the child. We accordingly reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.</blockquote>Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer filed concurring opinions. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan and joined in part by Justice Antonin Scalia, who also filed a separate dissent.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-adoption-of-american-indian-baby-girl.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in April. An attorney for the Adoptive Couple argued that the courts have interpreted the ICWA too broadly in applying it to this case. The attorney for Dustin Brown, the biological father of Baby Girl, argued that, barring Brown's inability to be a good father under the statute, his parental rights had to be terminated affirmatively. The Solicitor General supported Brown's claim.</p>]]></content:encoded>

St. Johns River Water Management District</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] in favor of a landowner in a property rights case. Carl Koontz, Sr. refused to contribute money to protect the wetlands in order to get a permit to redevelop some acres of land. The St. Johns River Water Management District then denied his permit, but did not take his land. The court analyzed the case under the essential nexus and rough proportionality tests of <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Nollan_v_California_Coastal_Commission_483_US_825_107_S_Ct_3141_9">Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</a> and <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Dolan_v_City_of_Tigard_512_US_374_114_S_Ct_2309_129_L_Ed_2d_304_3">Dolan v. City of Tigard</a> [opinions].  In those cases the court held that the government may not condition the approval of a land-use permit on the owner's relinquishment of a portion of his property unless there is a "nexus" and "rough proportionality" between the government's demand and the effects of the proposed land use. Reversing the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito held "that the government's demand for property from a land-use permit applicant must satisfy the requirements of <span class="casename">Nollan</span> and <span class="casename">Dolan</span> even when the government denies the permit and even when its demand is for money."

<p>Justice Elena Kagan filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Kagan would not extend <span class="casename">Nollan</span> and <span class="casename">Dolan</span> "to cases in which the government conditions a permit not on the transfer of real property, but instead on the payment or expenditure of money." The court <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-government-immunity-takings.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In so doing, the High Court affirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-court-dismissed-apple-patent-suit-against-samsung.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/tokyo/about/syokai/">Tokyo District Court</a> [official website, in Japanese] last August. Neither company has issued an official statement in response to Tuesday's ruling. This development comes on the heels of last Friday's <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/japan-court-rules-for-apple-in-samsung-patent-suit.php">ruling in favor of Apple</a> [JURIST report] regarding the scrolling bounce-back animation feature patent, in which a Japanese court found that Samsung infringed the patent.

CRR <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-files-lawsuit-in-north-dakota-to-block-nations-earliest-an">filed suit</a> [press release] on behalf of the <a href="http://www.redriverwomensclinic.com">Red River Women's Clinic</a> [clinic website] challenging <a href="http://legiscan.com/ND/bill/1456/2013">HB 1456</a> and <a href="http://legiscan.com/ND/bill/1305/2013">HB 1305</a> [materials], which, respectively, prohibit abortion after the point at which cardiac activity can be detected in a pregnancy, and for reasons of sex-selection and for genetic fetal anomaly. The ban on abortion after detection of a fetal heartbeat effectively prohibits abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy in opposition to <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, which allows abortions until the fetus is viable at 22 to 24 weeks. The ban on abortions sought for sex selection and fetal anomaly is reportedly the first of its kind in the US. CRR alleges that the laws "relegate the women of North Dakota to a second class of citizens" with rights unequal to women in other states, and that the restrictions place women's health in danger by banning abortion at a time before a woman may even know she is pregnant. The Red River Women's clinic is the only abortion clinic in North Dakota, and is reportedly used by women from neighboring states like South Dakota and Minnesota. 

<p>North Dakota has been at the forefront of the ongoing debate on <a href="/feature/2012/04/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in recent months. Last week North Dakota Judge Wickham Corwin <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/north-dakota-judge-combines-abortion-challenges.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that lawsuits challenging two state abortion laws can be combined into one case. In May CRR <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/north-dakota-abortion-law-challenged.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] a North Dakota law which restricts abortion providers to those doctors recognized by a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. This lawsuit supplemented a previous challenge against a 2011 North Dakota law restricting drug-induced abortions, which a state judge recently said he would <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-judge-to-strike-down-law-limiting-drug-induced-abortions.php">strike down</a> [JURIST report]. In April North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/north-dakota-governor-signs-fetal-pain-bill.php">signed a measure</a> [JURIST report] banning abortions after 20 weeks based on the controversial premise that a fetus can feel pain at that point. Dalrymple also signed into law the two measures which form the basis of CCR's complaint.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdulkarim al-Khader was one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.acprahr.org/">Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association</a> (ACPRA) [advocacy website in Arabic], which aimed to increase awareness of civil rights in the country. He was <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/uk-saudi-rights-idUKBRE95O0JA20130625">sentenced to prison</a> [Reuters report] after the ACPRA campaigned for a constitutional monarchy and elections in the Gulf Arab kingdom, during his time as its leader. Three years of the sentence must be spent in jail, and for five years he may avoid imprisonment only if he suspends his activities. The same court sentenced two other human rights activists, also founders of the ACPRA, to <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-human-rights-activitsts-to-10-years-in-prison.php">10 years in prison</a>  [JURIST report] in March. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information has <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=12360">denounced the sentencing</a> [press release] and demanded al-Khader's immediate release.   

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against human rights activists. A Saudi Arabian court in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/saudi-arabia-court-convicts-egypt-rights-lawyer-of-drug-smuggling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed el-Gezawi of smuggling drugs and sentenced him to five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. El-Gezawi's arrest sparked protests by those who believe the activist was arrested for insulting King Abdullah. In December <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor who co-founded the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression. In August several international human rights groups sent a letter to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">observe the trials of four rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In November 2009 a Spanish citizen found that a Google search of his name led to decades-old newspaper announcements listing his property on the market because of his failure to pay social security contributions. The man filed suit after Google refused to remove the information, alleging that the announcements could harm his reputation. After one of Spain's top courts upheld the complaint, the case was referred to the ECJ as a result of Google's appeal. The advocate general found Tuesday that, while Internet search companies must comply with EU data protection law, they cannot be held responsible for merely processing personal data which appears on webpages produced by third parties:<blockquote>An internet search engine service provider, whose search engine locates information published or included on the internet by third parties, indexes it automatically, stores it temporarily and finally makes it available to internet users according to a particular order of preference, 'processes' personal data...when that information contains personal data [pursuant to EU data protection law...However, the internet search engine service provider cannot be considered as a 'controller' of the processing of such personal data...Requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression.</blockquote>According to media sources, the ECJ is expected to rule in accordance with the advisory opinion before the end of the year despite its freedom to independently assess the merits of the case. 

<p>Google has faced criticism for numerous privacy issues recently. Last week French and Spanish data protection groups <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/european-data-authorities-threaten-to-fine-google-over-privacy-policy.php">threatened Google with fines</a> [JURIST report] if the company does not change its privacy policies on collecting user data. Earlier this month a judge in the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/federal-judge-rules-google-must-comply-with-national-security-letters.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google must follow the FBI's warrantless requests for user information through national security letters. In April six European countries <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/european-countries-commence-legal-action-against-google-over-privacy-policy.php">commenced legal action</a> [JURIST report] against Google regarding its privacy policies. Also in April Google <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/google-agrees-to-7-million-settlement-for-street-view-privacy-infractions.php">agreed to a $7 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] for its collection of improper data during its Street View campaign. Last December an Italian appeals court overturned the conviction of three Google executives for <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/italy-court-overturns-conviction-of-google-executives-for-privacy-violation.php">violating Italian privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] by posting a video on Google of a handicapped child being bullied. Last June a Swiss court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/switzerland-court-partially-rules-for-google-in-privacy-case.php">ruled partially for Google</a> [JURIST report] in a privacy suit involving its Street View service.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, according to the Special Rapporteur the country has not implemented adequate victim protection measures. Ezeilo recommended implementing a "data collection mechanism for determining the prevalence rate, forms, trends and manifestation of human trafficking in the country," as well developing a national plan of action that will include measures to reduce vulnerability of potential victims and ensure adequate protection of migrants.

In 2010 Lithuania launched an investigation into illegal detentions but closed it a year later. Lithuania has refused to disclose the information from the investigation and has refused to reopen it. The EU advocacy director at HRW Lotte Leicht said:<blockquote>Lithuania is betraying the fundamental principles of human rights that underline the European Union by refusing to investigate serious allegations of human rights crimes, such as disappearances and torture.

In 2009 the Lithuanian Parliament National Security Committee reported that the CIA had established secret prisons for al Qaeda suspects in the Baltic country. Lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/lithuania-lawmakers-demand.php">demanded the investigation</a> [JURIST report] after ABC News reported that former CIA officials said that Lithuania provided the CIA with facilities for a secret prison for high-value al Qaeda suspects in order to improve relations with the US. The parliamentary committee concluded that the Lithuanian State Security Department provided the CIA with two secret facilities, but it is unclear whether either facility was used to interrogate detainees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in two landmark <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] cases Wednesday. In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/windsor-v-united-states-2/">United States v. Windsor</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], the court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that Section 3 of the federal <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. Under DOMA, couples in same-sex marriages legally recognized by a state were denied federal benefits extended to married couples. Affirming the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-part-of-doma--dnp.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the court ruled that this provision violated Equal Protection. In the majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote:<blockquote>The class to which DOMA directs its restrictions and restraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State. DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty. It imposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and proper. DOMA instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others. The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</blockquote>The ruling does not create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage but means that couples in lawfully recognized same-sex marriages may now be entitled to certain federal benefits: "This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages." Kennedy's opinion was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Antonin Scalia also filed a dissent, which Justice Clarence Thomas joined and which the chief justice joined in part. Justice Samuel Alito also filed a dissenting opinion, joined in part by Thomas. According to Scalia's dissent, the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the case and also lacks power to overturn the law.

<p>In <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that the petitioners lacked standing to appeal the district court's order striking down <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's same-sex marriage ban. When Proposition 8 was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by the US District Judge Vaughn Walker, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Project Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law and appeal the ruling. In an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that these groups lack standing to do so:<blockquote>Federal courts have authority under the Constitution to answer such questions only if necessary to do so in the course of deciding an actual "case" or "controversy." As used in the Constitution, those words do not include every sort of dispute, but only those "historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicial process." ... This is an essential limit on our power: It ensures that we act as judges, and do not engage in policymaking properly left to elected representatives.</p>

<p>For there to be such a case or controversy, it is not enough that the party invoking the power of the court have a keen interest in the issue. That party must also have "standing," which requires, among other things, that it have suffered a concrete and particularized injury. Because we find that petitioners do not have standing, we have no authority to decide this case on the merits, and neither did the Ninth Circuit.</blockquote>The court vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The chief justice's opinion was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor. Kennedy would have found standing because the California Supreme Court has a right to interpret its own laws regarding who may intervene to support voter-approved ballot initiatives&#8212;a question it <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/california-high-court-rules-proposition-8-sponsors-may-defend-it-in-court.php">previously resolved</a> [JURIST report] in petitioners' favor. While the full impact of this decision remains to be seen, it appears likely that Walker's order will take effect and Proposition 8 will be unenforceable in California.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, released on the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/torturevictimsday/">UN International Day in Support of Victims of Torture</a> [official website], included quotes from members of those demographics claiming that various forms of sexual violence, beatings and humiliation were used to garnish favorable treatment from the guards or false confessions under duress. Of those interviewed, 100 percent reported treatment that violated the Lebanese adoption of <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN agreements</a> [text], but only about 10 percent requested a formal investigation from local authorities. Of those requests, only two were granted, but no charges were brought against the accused members of the police. The <a href="http://www.isf.gov.lb/English/Header/HomePage/Pages/Homepage.aspx">Internal Security Forces of Lebanon</a> [official website] is supposed to provide relief for civilians whose rights have been violated, but HRW alleged that they are unresponsive to most calls for help from concerned citizens. 

<p>Lebanese police have been targeting at-risk communities for several years, according to HRW. Last August HRW reported that the Lebanese police were using anal examinations to determine the sexual orientation of <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-lebanon-must-cease-intrusive-physical-examinations-used-to-prosecute-gay-men.php">suspected gay men</a> [JURIST report]. The announcement came on the heels of an arrest of 36 men at a gay cinema in July, which saw all the suspects subjected to anal examinations by forensics doctors to determine if they were guilty of violating <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,IRBC,,LBN,4784def6c,0.html">Article 534</a> [UNHCR backgrounder] of the Lebanese penal code, which criminalizes "sexual relations against nature" and is used to prosecute homosexuality. <a href="http://www.helem.net/">Helem</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic], Lebanon's most prominent LGBT rights group, reported last June that that even when the examinations produce no evidence, it <a href="http://www.helem.net/node/213">does not vindicate the suspect</a> [press release, in Arabic], as doctors report the suspect to the Attorney General regardless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-blackmail-case-and-red-river-case.php">report</a>] that attempting to compel a person to recommend that his employer approve an investment does not constitute "the obtaining of property from another" under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/131mcrm.htm">Hobbs Act</a> [18 USC &#167; 1951(a)]. In this case, Sekhar allegedly threatened the attorney for New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli to gain a government contract through DiNapoli's attorney's recommendation of Sekhar. The court's ruling effectively reversed the <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Sekhar_683_F3d_436_2d_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">decision</a> [text] of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which had held that the attorney's "recommendation" is intangible property of the state of New York, and thus under the jurisdiction of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/875">federal extortion law</a> [18 USC &#167; 875(d)]. In the court's unanimous opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote:<blockquote>The Government's defense of the theory of conviction is unpersuasive. No fluent speaker of English would say that "petitioner <em>obtained and exercised</em> the general counsel's right to make a recommendation," any more than he would say that a person "<em>obtained and exercised</em> another's right to free speech." He would say that "petitioner <em>forced</em> the general counsel to make a particular recommendation," just as he would say that a person "<em>forced</em> another to make a statement." Adopting the Government's theory here would not only make nonsense of words; it would collapse the longstanding distinction between extortion and coercion and ignore Congress's choice to penalize one but not the other.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, which was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor. Alito stated that "the term "property" plainly does not reach everything that a person may hold dear; nor does it extend to everything that might in some indirect way portend the possibility of future economic gain." Alito also stated that prior court precedent "supports the conclusion that internal recommendations regarding government decisions are not property."]]></content:encoded>

Australia <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/130626/australia-harpoons-japans-whaling-at-top-un-court">argued</a> [AFP report] at Wednesday's hearing that Japan is in violation of the <a href="http://www.unep.ch/regionalseas/legal/iwc.htm">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [materials] by continuing to hunt whales as scientific research in spite of a ban on commercial whaling by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/">International Whaling Commission</a> [official website]. Public hearings for this case are scheduled to proceed until July 16.

<p>This case has been ongoing since June 2010, when the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Japan to seek an injunction against "scientific whaling" in the Southern Ocean. The complaint alleged that Japan had continued to pursue large-scale whaling under Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic ("JARPA II"), and had thus breached its "good faith" obligation to limit the killing of whales for commercial purposes to zero. Australia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/australia-lodges-complaint-against-japan-whaling-in-icj.php">filed a complaint with the ICJ</a> [JURIST report] against Japan for its whaling practices in May 2011. In November 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-zealand-joins-australia-in-japanese-whaling-legal-dispute.php">New Zealand announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would support Australia in its battle against Japanese whaling practices.

Heyns voiced his concern "that capital punishment appears to have been imposed without due process safeguards in violation of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] to which Nigeria acceded to on 29 July 1993." These executions come after the government of Nigeria reaffirmed their commitment to a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in 2009. The issue of extrajudicial killings however, is not new in Nigeria. A 2008 UN report found that extrajudicial executions by police were widespread and that the legal system suffered from frequent procedural irregularities, extremely poor death row conditions, and the imposition of the death penalty for adultery and sodomy.

<p>The Special Rapporteur has been active in speaking out against executions around the world. In March Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-restrict-use-of-death-penalty.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to restrict the use of capital punishment to comply with their international human rights obligations after a Malawian national Adami Wilson was executed by firing squad following his conviction on drug smuggling charges. In December at the end of his official visit to Turkey he <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-expert-turkey-must-do-more-to-end-unlawful-killings.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that while Turkey has made progress in cracking down on extrajudicial killings, it still has a long way to go in remedying the problem. Last July, Heyns <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-official-concerned-over-iraq-death-sentences.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about an announcement that the Iraqi Court of Cassation has upheld the death sentences of 196 individuals in the Anbar province of Iraq. Heyns urged the Iraqi government to immediately halt all executions and review death row cases, noting that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-iraq-should-stop-all-executions.php">supported a similar call</a> [JURIST report] made last January by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban also encouraged member states to recognize the 25th anniversary of the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">Committee Against Torture</a> [official website], which he characterized as "vital" to furthering a "victim-oriented approach" to stopping torture. Ban further urged member states to "accede to and fully implement" a UN resolution adopted earlier this year which focuses on the rehabilitation of torture victims. In addition, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] marked IDSVT by <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13482&LangID=E">calling on member states</a> [statement] to "fulfill their obligations" with respect to ensuring that torture victims can obtain "redress and rehabilitation for the suffering they have endured." The OHCHR emphasized the importance of the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/events/torture/fund.htm">Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture</a> [UN backgrounder], which provides support to organizations that contribute humanitarian, medical and legal assistance to torture victims. According to the UN donations have dropped nearly 30 percent in the last five years. The OHCHR estimates that the fund supports between 50,000 and 70,000 victims.

<p>Torture and ill-treatment of individuals remain problems throughout the international community. On Wednesday Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/hrw-lebanon-police-engaging-in-torture.php">accused Lebanese police forces</a> [JURIST report] of targeting and torturing drug users, sex workers and members of LGBT communities. In June 2012 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon marked IDSVT by urging the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-sg-urges-nations-to-cease-torture-against-civilians.php">take measures to stop torture</a> [JURIST report] by numerous states against their own citizens. In June 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay commemorated IDSVY by <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-commissioner-pledges-justice-for-torture-victims.php">warning</a> [JURIST report] those who practice torture that they cannot escape the reach of justice.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-794.htm">White v. Woodall</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/cert-pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider jury instructions in a death penalty case. Robert Keith Woodall pleaded guilty to murder and chose not to testify during the penalty phase. His request that the jury be instructed not to draw any adverse inference from his decision not to testify was denied, and the jury sentenced him to death. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5337526057851803759&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">granted <em>habeas</em> relief</a> [opinion]. The questions before the court are (1) whether the Sixth Circuit violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2254">28 USC &#167;2254(d)(1)</a> [text] by granting <em>habeas</em> relief on the trial court's failure to provide a no adverse inference instruction even though the Supreme Court has not "clearly established" that such an instruction is required in a capital penalty phase when a non-testifying defendant has pleaded guilty to the crimes and aggravating circumstances; and (2) whether the Sixth Circuit violated the harmless error standard in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6677457092480063813&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Brecht v. Abrahamson</a> [opinion] in ruling that the absence of a no adverse inference instruction was not harmless in spite of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the face of a guilty plea to the crimes and aggravators.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-8561.htm">Paroline v. United States</a> [docket] the court will decide what, if any, causal relationship or nexus between the defendant's conduct and the victim's harm or damages must the government or the victim establish in order to recover restitution under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2259">18 USC &#167; 2259</a> [text]. The case involves restitution for a victim of child pornography. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-41238-CV2.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] "that &#167; 2259 imposes no generalized proximate cause requirement before a child pornography victim may recover restitution from a defendant possessing images of her abuse."</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1094.htm">Cline v. Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/12-1094-Cline-v.-Oklahoma-Coalition-for-Reproductive-Justice-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], a case concerning abortion-inducing drugs, the court certified the following question to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma: Whether <a href="http://e-lobbyist.com/gaits/text/287092">HB 1970</a> [text, DOC], Section 1, Chapter 216, OSL 2011 prohibits: (1) the use of misoprostol to induce abortions, including the use of misoprostol in conjunction with mifepristone according to a protocol approved by the Food and Drug Administration; and (2) the use of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancies. The court reserved further proceedings in the case until it receives a response from the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] HB 1970 in December, along with an abortion ultrasound law. Oklahoma's attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/oklahoma-ag-petitions-supreme-court-review-abortion-laws.php">petitioned the Supreme Court for review</a> [JURIST report] in March.</p>

<p>The court also sent two Texas <a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] cases back to the US District Court for the District of Columbia for reconsideration in light of its decision in <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">Shelby County v. Holder</a> [JURIST report], which struck down Section 4 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-1028.htm">Texas v. Holder</a> [docket] concerns Texas' <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-gives-texas-permission-to-appeal-voter-id-law-ruling.php">voter ID law</a>, and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-496.htm">Texas v. United States</a> [docket] concerns <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-court-rules-texas-voting-map-discriminatory.php">redistricting</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

<p>Also Thursday the court declined to review two new <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-23.htm">Brewer v. Diaz</a> [docket] the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-arizona-same-sex-couples-insurance-benefits-temporarily.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona law denying benefits to same-sex partners of public employees. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-689.htm">Coalition for Protection of Marriage v. Sevcik</a> [docket] the US District Court for the District of Nevada <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's same-sex marriage ban. The Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit group which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the Supreme Court for review</a> [JURIST report] before the Ninth Circuit could hear the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The licenses, however, will not be issued until the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit confirms that the stay of the injunction against <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's same-sex marriage ban, has been dissolved. This statement was issued only hours after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the petitioners lacked standing to appeal the district court's order striking down Proposition 8. The governor's statement was in response to a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/AG-letter-re-Prop.-8.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/about">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] stating, among other things, that the injunction will apply statewide in all 58 counties of California.

<p>When Proposition 8 was initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by US District Judge Vaughn Walker, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current Governor Jerry Brown, who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left defendant-intervenors <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and other groups to continue to defend the law and appeal the ruling. Wednesday's 5-4 opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A total of 11 people were killed in the bombings, and approximately 140 were injured. In denying his appeal, the anti-terrorism court upheld Ramirez' life sentence. Ramirez has <a href=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/french-court-upholds-carlos-the-jackal-life-sentence/story-e6frg6so-1226670671963">called himself</a> [AFP report] a "professional revolutionary" and has claimed to have been involved in dozens of attacks which have killed and injured hundreds of people. Despite these claims, Ramirez has continued to deny any involvement in the four bombings. Ramirez's lawyer Isabelle Coutant-Peyre <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23079065">stated</a> [BBC report] that her client would appeal again.

<p>Ramirez is also currently serving a second life sentence in France for the murder of two French policemen and a Lebanese informer in 1975. Ramirez was convicted <em>in absentia</em> for those murders in 1992. He was captured by the French secret service in 1994, retried for those crimes and began serving a life sentence after he was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9712/23/carlos/index.html?_s=PM:WORLD">again convicted in 1997</a> [CNN report]. In July 2006 the appeals chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] in Strasbourg <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/jailed-terrorist-appeals-solitary.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] from Ramirez claiming that the eight years he spent in solitary confinement in a French prison was a breach of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/europe-rights-court-says-eight-years.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Ramirez' solitary confinement was not inhumane and did not otherwise violate his human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201306251076.html">Summit of the Gulf of Guinea Heads of State and Government</a> [All Africa report] closed with the adoption of the <a href="http://www.imo.org/Pages/home.aspx">International Maritime Organization</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Security/PiracyArmedRobbery/Guidance/Documents/MSC.1-Circ.1333.pdf">Code of Conduct concerning the Prevention and Repression of Piracy, Armed Robbery against Ships, and Illegal Maritime Activities in West and Central Africa</a> [text, PDF]. This development is seen as especially significant because it is a regional solution that is not limited to one or two countries. The summit was attended by the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of Central African States</a> (ECCAS), the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official websites] and the Gulf of Guinea Commission (GGC). The Secretary-General has encouraged all member nations to ratify the agreement individually in order to unify local and regional efforts. 

<p>This is a major development in the ongoing struggle to unify anti-piracy task forces across deeply divided regions. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] last November <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2012/sc10824.doc.htm">condemned</a> [statement; <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43569&Cr=&Cr1=#.UK4804WmD8B">press release</a>] piracy and acts of armed robbery against vessels off the coast of Somalia. It urged the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-piracy-off-somalia-coast.php">develop a comprehensive response</a> [JURIST report] to discourage these acts. This summit is one of the first to do so, in response to <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10824.doc.htm">resolution 2077</a> [text]. The resolution called on member states to enact domestic legislation that criminalizes piracy and to assist Somalia in prosecuting pirates. Also last November UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson stressed the need to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/senior-un-official-calls-for-multi-dimensional-approach-to-fighting-piracy.php">address the causes of maritime piracy</a> [JURIST report] with a "multi-dimensional approach". Addressing the UN Security Council, Eliasson noted three areas of concern that warrant immediate action: 1) better coordination, information-sharing and trust-building among countries and agencies involved in counter-piracy operations; 2) stronger capacity to prosecute piracy cases and imprison those convicted in accordance with international human rights standards; and 3) the establishment of a framework governing the use of privately contracted armed security personnel on board vessels. The month previous the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">issued sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 10 Somalis who were involved in the hijacking the German freighter MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia two years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeals court reversed the <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Order-for-HL-PI.pdf">denial</a> [opinion, PDF] of a preliminary injunction from the <a href="http://www.okwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma</a> [official websites], holding that Hobby Lobby and Mardel are entitled to bring claims under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.2043:">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text]. The Green family, founders of Hobby Lobby and its sister company Mardel, contend that businesses, not just the currently exempted religious groups, should be excepted from that part of the PPACA if it violates the business-owners' religious beliefs. The court found that Hobby Lobby and Mardel sufficiently established a likelihood of success that their rights under this statute are substantially burdened by the contraceptive-coverage requirement and that they have established an irreparable harm. The court stopped short of granting or denying the preliminary injunction, however, remanding the case back to the district court for further evaluation of the two remaining preliminary injunction factors&#8212;balance of equities and public interest.

<p>The Green family challenge is one of the latest developments surrounding the PPACA. In February a group of nine senators and two representatives <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/us-legislators-join-hobby-lobby-in-challenge-to-contraception-mandate.php">joined to file an amicus brief</a> [JURIST report] in support of Hobby Lobby and Mardel. Last December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] said it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">not intervene</a> by issuing an injunction while an appeal was still pending with the Tenth Circuit, to which the Greens have responded that they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/two-businesses-will-not-comply-with-supreme-courts-order-on-contraception-mandate.php">not comply</a> [JURIST reports] with the mandate even without a protective injunction. Justice Sonia Sotomayor ruled that the Oklahoma City family's religiously oriented business did not meet the requirements to allow an injunction against the PPACA's mandate. The opinion stated that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking at the Vienna +20 Conference, Pillay reminded countries to "revive the spirit" of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(symbol)/a.conf.157.23.en">Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action</a> (VDPA) [text], adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993. Pillay congratulated countries on their achievements following the adoption of the VDPA but reminded them of the numerous conflicts that have led to gross violations of human rights, naming Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq as examples. Opening the conference, Pillay cautioned that human rights are not universally available, and UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45284#.Ucy96_Y6VYk">followed</a> [press release], advising countries to make an effort to prioritize human rights issues.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has addressed a variety of human rights abuses around the world in the past.

Speaking at the opening of the 22nd session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Pillay specifically mentioned the ongoing situations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Palestine, Iraq, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan and Syria. Also in February Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-israel-prisoners-on-hunger-strike.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports that three Palestinians being held in Israeli custody were in poor health from hunger strikes protesting Israel's use of administrative detention. In the same timeframe, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-rights-chief-criticizes-sri-lanka-failure-to-investigate-abuses.php">unveiled a report</a> [JURIST report] criticizing Sri Lanka for failing to investigate widespread reports of killings and other atrocities during the latter days of the nation's 26-year civil war it fought with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

Senators <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00168">voted 68-32</a> [roll call vote] to pass the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act, which would allow undocumented immigrants to work and travel within the US under a provisional legal status. If prospective citizens maintain a clean criminal record and an employment status in accordance with the law, they would be free to apply for a green card in 10 years and US citizenship in 13. The bill also seeks to revamp the legal immigration system, particularly with respect to the number of temporary work visas for immigrants with training in science, mathematics and agriculture. In addition the law would increase federal funding for border security with Mexico to an estimated (USD) $46.3 billion, the largest increase ever endorsed. A bipartisan group of US senators <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/us-senators-unveil-immigration-reform-bill.php">unveiled details</a> [JURIST report] of the long-awaited bill in April. According to media sources the bill is likely to encounter resistance in the US House of Representatives where lawmakers are reportedly considering alternative measures. 

<p><a href="/feature/2013/06/immigration.php">Immigration reform</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continues to be a divisive political and social issue in the US. Earlier this month the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/aclu-challenges-us-deportation-practices.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in a Los Angeles federal court alleging that Border Patrol and immigration officers coerced hundreds or possibly thousands of Mexican nationals into signing their own deportation documents and forfeiting their right to a fair hearing before an immigration judge. In May the Connecticut Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/connecticut-senate-approves-drivers-licenses-for-undocumented-immigrants.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses regardless of documentation status. Also in May a judge for the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/federal-court-rules-arizona-sheriff-violated-latinos-constitutional-rights.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his department engaged in unconstitutional racial profiling during the execution of immigration patrols. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the UN, terrorist groups killed more than 3,100 Iraqi civilians and injured more than 12,100 during 2012. UNAMI stresses that these figures indicate a reversal in the reduction of violence in recent years and a growth in the use of "asymmetric tactics" deliberately targeting civilians. UNAMI notes that while political instability continues to impede security in Iraq, leaders must do more to ensure "the proper coordination" of "financial, medical and other forms of support" for victims of violence. In addition UNAMI reports that the government continues to impose "lengthy periods of pre-trial detention" without formal charge because of the lack of resources provided to members of the judiciary. As a result detainees have allegedly complained of inadequate access to legal counsel. UNAMI also calls on leaders to implement a moratorium on the death penalty in accordance with several UN resolutions. According to the report the government executed 123 prisoners during 2012, some after extracting confessions through abuse and torture. UNAMI urges the government to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13493&LangID=E">take all necessary measures</a> [press release] to implement the recommendations set forth in the report. 

<p>The human rights situation in Iraq remains fragile. In July 2012 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-recent-coordinated-attacks-across-iraq.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a coordinated string of bombings and shootings in 13 cities, including Baghdad, that killed at least 91 people and injured nearly 200 more. In May 2012 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/iraq-human-rights-situation-still-fragile-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the human rights situation in Iraq continues to struggle during the nation's transition from a decade-long dictatorship to a peaceful democratic system. UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iraq-human-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011 that human rights abuses continue to plague various regions of Iraq. In December 2008 UNAMI <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/human-rights-violations-continuing-in.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that while general security conditions in Iraq have improved, human rights violations have continued, especial with respect to the treatment of detainees in the country. In November 2008 UN envoy to Iraq Staffan de Mistura <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/new-iraq-human-rights-commission.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] Iraq's new Independent High Commission for Human Rights, calling it a "milestone" for human rights in the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although American Samoans are considered US nationals, American Samoa is the only US territory where <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/judge-dismisses-federal-lawsuit-by-american-samoa-residents-seeking-birthright-citizenship/2013/06/27/43c637b2-df6b-11e2-8cf3-35c1113cfcc5_story.html">birthright citizenship is not granted</a> [AP report]. The plaintiffs argued that the Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause, which declares, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside," should grant them US citizenship. However, Judge Richard Leon disagreed, saying that the citizenship clause does not apply to unincorporated territories, such as American Samoa:<blockquote>Federal courts have held over and over again that unincorporated territories are not included within the citizenship clause, and this court sees no reason to do otherwise. ... To date, Congress has not seen fit to bestow birthright citizenship upon American Samoa, and in accordance with the law, this court must and will respect that choice.</blockquote>The plaintiffs plan to appeal the ruling.

<p>The plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/american-samoa-natives-sue-for-us-citizenship-birthright.php">filed their citizenship lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last July. Over the last century Congress has granted citizenship rights to Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In 2011 JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://tupazlaw.com/profile.htm">Edsel Tupaz</a> [official profile] wrote about several areas of the <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/edsel-tupaz-spratlys-dispute.php">international law of the seas</a> [JURIST comment] and complex issues of multilateral diplomacy that must be dealt with in order to resolve the dispute, noting that American Samoa's delegate to the US House of Representatives had introduced <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/as00_faleomavaega/enicallsuponchinatoresolve.html">House Resolution 352</a> [text] calling for "a peaceful and collaborative resolution to maritime territorial disputes in the South China Sea and other maritime areas adjacent to the East Asian mainland." In July 2010 American Samoa concluded a constitutional convention that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/american-samoa-concludes-constitutional-convention.php">approved several amendments to the territory's 1967 constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The amendments removed much of the authority of the US Department of the Interior (DOI) in the country and shifted that power to local officials. Some of the specific changes approved by the convention included removing the DOI's ability to override vetoes of the American Samoan governor and removing the DOI's ability to reject amendments to the territory's constitution. American Samoa has been a US territory since 1900.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Shortly before his murder, Das <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/bangladeshi-court-jails/727970.html">published a series of reports</a> [AFP report] detailing corruption by BNP officials.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn a great deal of international attention recently for its handling of political violence.

According to the rules, these final regulations seek to protect public health and guarantee women equal access to health care and are narrowly tailored so that certain organizations with religious objections do not have to "contract, arrange, pay or refer for such coverage." An exempt organization must be organized and operate as a nonprofit entity, and either be a religious employer under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6033">Internal Revenue Code</a> [text], or hold itself out as a religious organization and self-certify that it meets these requirements in a form and manner specified by <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/">Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official profile]. Religious employers are exempt from providing contraceptive coverage. Religious organizations must notify its insurer that it objects to contraceptive coverage, and the insurer must notify its enrollees that it will provide them with "separate no-cost payments for contraceptive services for as long as they remain enrolled in the health plan." 

<p>In February the Obama administration issued a rule detailing a broader exemption to the contraception mandate, allowing for religious nonprofits that object to providing health insurance coverage for birth control to opt out of the requirement. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>], enacted in 2010, requires employer-provided health care to cover government-recommended preventive services, including birth control pills and sterilization procedures, without co-payments. Since the Act's conception, the Obama administration has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/01/contraception-mandate_n_2598893.html">faced with numerous lawsuits</a> [Huffington Post report] from <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/tenth-circuit-rules-for-hobby-lobby-in-health-care-challenge.php">private companies</a> as well as <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/state-ags-to-continue-with-health-care-contraception-challenge.php">state attorney generals' offices</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday announced in a <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/06/28/1016696o.pdf">one-sentence order</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ban on same-sex marriages "is dissolved effective immediately". This order comes after the Supreme Court's decision on Wednesday that upheld the invalidation of <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>]. After Friday's court order, California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] declared that same-sex marriage <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18111">"is now legal in California"</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/california-governor-orders-marriage-licenses-issued-to-same-sex-couples.php">report</a>] and that marriage licenses must be issued "immediately." 

<p>Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by US District Judge Vaughn Walker, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, former attorney general and current Governor Brown, who were originally defendants in the lawsuit. The defendants, however, declined to continue defending the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left groups like <a href=" http://protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website] and others to continue to defend the law and appeal the ruling. In 2012, opponents of Proposition 8 <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/supreme-court-urged-to-deny-review-of-california-proposition-8-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court not to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari submitted by Proposition 8 supporters. Also in 2012, the Ninth Circuit denied a petition filed by supporters of Proposition 8 to rehear their case before the entire court. Wednesday's 5-4 opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawrence Hutchins III. The Court's <a href=" http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/newcaaf/opinions/2012SepTerm/12-0408.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] was based on the claim that Sgt. Hutchins's constitutional rights were violated when he was held in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer for seven days in 2006. Sgt. Hutchins has served half of an 11-year sentence for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, making a false official statement and larceny for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of Iraqi civilian Hashim Ibrahim Awad in Hamdania [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdania">news archive</a>] in Al Anbar province. Although Sgt. Hutchins could be freed in several days, the Navy could order a new court martial or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case. 

<p>This decision marks the latest in a series of developments concerning Sgt. Hutchins. In 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-to-review-us-marine-murder-conviction.php">decided to hear</a> [JURIST report] Sgt.

Hutchins, two months after his conviction for killing an Iraqi citizen was reversed by the Navy-Marine Court for Criminal Appeals, citing lack of a fair trial. In 2008, the US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-reduces-sentence-for-marine.php">reduced the sentence</a> [JURIST report] of Sgt. Hutchins to 11 years in detention and a rank reduction to Private before being dishonorably discharged. In 2007, a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">sentenced Sgt. Hutchins</a> [JURIST report] to 15 years in prison for his role in the commission of the 2006 kidnapping and murder.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month President Karzai appointed five new commissioners to the human rights board, known as the <a href="http://www.aihrc.org.af/en">Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission</a> (AIHRC) [official website]. Established under the Afghan Constitution and meant to serve as the overseeing body on human rights issues within the country, the AIHRC has played an "absolutely critical, frontline role in defending human rights in Afghanistan," according to Pillay. However, Pillay fears that the new appointments do not square well with the <a href="http://www.info.gov.hk/info/eoc/annex6_e.pdf">Paris Principles</a> [text, PDF], guidelines which set out best practice for such institutions to function independently. The AIHRC is up for review by the <a href="http://nhri.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/default.aspx">International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions</a> [official website] this upcoming November, a re-accreditation process that could jeopardize their current "A" rating. 

<p>Afghanistan is no stranger to <a href="/hotline/2012/12/heather-barr-afghanistan-executions.php">criticism</a> [JURIST op-ed] over their human rights objectives. In October 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] which showed that nearly half of the 273 detainees interviewed said that they had been subject to torture. A month earlier, HRW released a report showing that the Afghan Local Police had been committing <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">serious rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and that officers were not being held accountable for these abuses. The UN also released a report in March of 2010 showing that human rights abuses in Afghanistan were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensifying the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report] in the country, which affected more than two-thirds of its population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Passed in 2011 by a Republican-controlled Legislature, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/federal-judge-blocks-mich-law-that-banned-domestic-partner-benefits-for-some-public-workers/2013/06/28/03ef626c-e056-11e2-a0de-145598a7b2b7_story.html">the law ended insurance</a> [Washington Post report] for people whose domestic partners work for certain public employers. While Michigan's <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(gnp4rp55nkjb5aqller12k55))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Constitution">Constitution</a> [text] has barred same-sex couples from marrying since 2004, some <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/28/us-usa-michigan-domesticpartners-idUSBRE95R13Z20130628">public employers had extended benefits</a> [Reuters report] to same-sex domestic partners, a development that arguably served as the impetus for the law's passage. Judge David Lawson, presiding over the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website], likened the ban to the recently-invalidated <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr3396/text/rh">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text], citing on five separate occasions the two-day-old <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Windsor_No_12307_2013_BL_168683_US_June_26_2013_C/1">opinion</a> [text] in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+v+windsor">United States v. Windsor</a> [JURIST news archive]. Taking note of the rapidly-evolving cultural views on same-sex relationships, Judge Lawson quotes Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion, stating, "the Constitution's guarantee of equality must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot justify disparate treatment of that group." Michigan's nearly 9-year-old ban on same-sex marriage is also under review before a Michigan federal court, although as of right now a date of decision is still unknown.

<p>The decision by Michigan's Eastern District Court comes on the same day as the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>' [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ninth-circuit-lifts-californias-ban-on-same-sex-marriages.php">order to lift</a> [JURIST report], effective immediately, the ban on same-sex marriages in California. Both lower court decisions follow the Supreme Court's landmark rulings on California's <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/Hollingsworth_v_Perry_No_12144_2013_BL_169619_118_FEP_Cases_1446_">Proposition 8</a> [opinion] and the previously-mentioned DOMA. With approval from both California Governor Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/29/us-usa-court-gaymarriage-california-idUSBRE95R15N20130629">marriage ceremonies began Friday night</a> [Reuters report] across California, with hundreds of couples lining up to exchange nuptials and receive their marriage licenses. Proposition 8 plaintiffs Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier were one of the first marriages of the evening, overlooking the grand staircase at San Francisco City Hall the two were married by state Attorney General Harris. Fellow plaintiffs Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo were married the same night at Los Angeles City Hall by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/06/30/russia-putin-signs-gay-propaganda-ban-into-law/%22">imposes fines</a> [AFP report] of up to 5,000 rubles ($166) and creates the power to suspend legal entities for 90 days for citizens who disseminate information suggesting that homosexuality is "socially equivalent" to heterosexuality. Additionally, foreigners who violate the law will face fines, administrative arrest up to 15 days and eventual deportation. In addition, organizations face fines of up to one million rubles and shutdown of their activity for 90 days. The fines increase to 200,000 rubles ($6,250) for officials who distribute the material through the media or internet. Last week, Putin denied that the law was anti-gay. 

<p>Russia has faced international criticism recently for legislation prohibiting the distribution of "homosexual propaganda" among minors. Last month the European Union (EU) <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/eu-concerned-over-russia-human-rights-record.php">urged Russia</a> [JURIST report] to refrain from adopting "homosexual propaganda" legislation, which the EU believed could "increase discrimination and violence against LGBT individuals." In February a group of UN human rights experts also <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/un-urges-russia-lawmakers-to-reject-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">urged Russian lawmakers to reject</a> [JURIST report] proposed legislation banning the dissemination of "homosexual propaganda" to minors. Last May prominent Russian gay rights activist Nikolai Alekeyev became the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/russia-gay-activist-first-to-be-convicted-under-controversial-city-ordinance.php">first to be convicted</a> [JURIST report] for spreading "homosexual propaganda" to minors.

The panel held that the ordinance does not have an "impermissible effect by removing a class of aliens from the city" or intrude on federal immigration and anti-harboring laws. The ordinance requires potential renters to apply for a license through which Fremont officials can check to see if they have legal status. In light of this ruling, lawyers for the plaintiffs plan to confer with their clients before determining whether to ask the full Eighth Circuit to review the case. 

<p>The housing ordinance has faced various challenges since its introduction in 2010. Last year a judge for the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-nebraska-city-immigration-ordinance.php">struck down the law</a> [JURIST report] because it conflicted with federal law. In November of 2010 the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nebraska-high-court-declines-to-rule-on-local-immigration-ordinance.php">declined to rule</a> [JURIST report] on the ordinance. In July of 2010 the Fremont City Council voted unanimously to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/nebraska-city-council-suspends-immigration-law-pending-litigation.php">suspend the ordinance</a> [JURIST report]. In June of 2010 Fremont voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php">approved the ordinance </a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

This petition comes one day after the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/ninth-circuit-lifts-californias-ban-on-same-sex-marriages.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in a <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2013/06/28/1016696o.pdf">one-sentence order</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ban on same-sex marriages "is dissolved effective immediately". After Friday's court order, California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] declared that same-sex marriage <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18111">is now legal in California</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/california-governor-orders-marriage-licenses-issued-to-same-sex-couples.php">report</a>] and that marriage licenses must be issued immediately. However, attorneys for ADF call the Ninth Circuit's actions "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities that have unfairly thwarted the defense of California's marriage amendment." ADF argued that Friday's actions are premature because under US Supreme Court rules, parties of a dispute must be given 25 days to request a rehearing.

<p>This petition comes comes on the heels of the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/hollingsworth-v-perry/">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-doma-dismisses-proposition-8-appeal.php">report</a>] invalidated<a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf"> Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>]. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 by US District Judge Vaughn Walker. Then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current governor Brown were originally defendants in the lawsuit. The defendants, however, declined to continue defending the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report]. This left groups like <a href="http://protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage </a>[advocacy website] and others to continue to defend the law and appeal the ruling. In 2012, opponents of Proposition 8 <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/supreme-court-urged-to-deny-review-of-california-proposition-8-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court not to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari submitted by Proposition 8 supporters. Also in 2012 the Ninth Circuit denied a petition filed by supporters of Proposition 8 to rehear their case before the entire court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The men were detained for a year and a half before being charged and sent to trial. All seven were convicted of inciting protests through Facebook and of harming public order via the internet, in violation of the nation's Anti-Cyber Crime Law. Joe Stork, the deputy Middle East director at HRW, called on the EU to confront Saudi Arabia about its crackdown on protesters: <blockquote>"Sending people off to years in prison for peaceful Facebook posts sends a strong message that there&#8217;s no safe way to speak out in Saudi Arabia, even on online social networks. If the EU doesn&#8217;t raise these cases with Saudi officials this weekend, its silence will look like craven compliance with the rights abuses of an authoritarian state."</blockquote> EU representatives are meeting with their Gulf region counterparts in Bahrain on Sunday.

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against human rights activists. Abdulkarim al-Khader, one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.acprahr.org/">Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association</a> (ACPRA) [advocacy website, in Arabic], which aimed to increase awareness of civil rights in the country, was <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/saudi-arabia-court-sentences-rights-activist-to-8-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] last week to eight years in prison for sedition. A Saudi Arabian court in January <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/saudi-arabia-court-convicts-egypt-rights-lawyer-of-drug-smuggling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] prominent Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed el-Gezawi of smuggling drugs and sentenced him to five years imprisonment and 300 lashes. El-Gezawi's arrest sparked protests by those who believe the activist was arrested for insulting King Abdullah. In December HRW urged Saudi Arabia to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-urges-saudi-arabia-to-drop-apostasy-charges-against-website-editor.php">drop apostasy charges</a> [JURIST report] against a website editor who co-founded the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, claiming that his arrest violated his right to freedom of expression. In August several international human rights groups sent a letter to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice </a>[official website, in Arabic] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">observe the trials of four rights activists</a> [JURIST report] who faced charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government.<br />
