		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi law makers Monday reached an agreement to temporarily divide control of  <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] among the city&#39;s ethnic groups, as part of a compromise bill providing for provincial elections in the city. Control of Kirkuk has been major point of contention, with Kurdish members of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] demanding a referendum allowing city residents to decide whether or not to join the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq. Kirkuk Turkmen and Arabs had <a href="http://www.iraqupdates.com/p_articles.php/article/34131">opposed the referendum</a> [VOI report] for fear of eviction should the city become part of the region, and instead had supported long-term proportional representation among the groups. A vote on the elections bill was originally planned to take place on Sunday, but is now scheduled for Tuesday because of <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i78a8WhNf9-f4mUhHfd2p1Ker-PQ">delays in reaching the agreement</a> [AFP report]. Reuters has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/08/04/europe/OUKWD-UK-IRAQ.php">more</a>.<br /><br />An earlier version of the bill had been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.parliament.iq/Iraqi_Council_of_Representatives.php?name=articles_ajsdyawqwqdjasdba46s7a98das6dasda7das4da6sd8asdsawewqeqw465e4qweq4wq6e4qw8eqwe4qw6eqwe4sadkj&file=showdetails&sid=1911">passed</a> [Council of Representatives press release, in Arabic; AP <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080723/D923GPU80.html">report</a>]  by the Iraqi parliament in July, but was rejected by <a href="http://www.cabinet.iq/">Iraqi President Jalal Talabani</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">profile</a>] and the two other members of the Iraqi Presidency Council because Kurdish parliamentarians had&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/kurdish-lawmakers-protest-draft.php">walked out of the vote in protest</a> [JURIST report]. In February, the Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected an earlier draft provincial elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] that will lead to the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website] Monday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/183591-183752.pdf">enjoined</a> [ruling, PDF] government agents from signing a peace agreement with rebels from the <a href="http://www.luwaran.com/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> (MILF) [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3003809.stm">backgrounder</a>], which would have granted expanded boundaries to the country&#39;s southern <a href="http://www.armm.gov.ph/index.php?section=1">Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</a> (ARMM) [official website]. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP)  <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/philippine-government-may-allow.php">first suggested</a> that it might agree to increased autonomy for the region in 2005, and last week the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/philippines-resolves-regional-autonomy.php">announced</a> [JURIST reports] that the sides had finalized the peace deal and would sign it on August 5. The court Monday agreed with motions by two southern provincial governments for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the signing, deciding to: <blockquote>ISSUE a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER, effective immediately, and continuing until further orders from this Court, commanding and directing public respondents and their agents to CEASE and DESIST from formally signing the GRP-MILF Peace Panel Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain.</blockquote> The government must respond within five days, and oral arguments are scheduled for August 15. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5idSKDtfjHM_OyXqCYymsfqwyEQvg">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquirer</span> has <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080804-152525/UPDATE-2-SC-stops-MOA-signing">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In addition to the recognized size of the region, the two sides said last week that they had also reached <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBB5NIkDpLv3hZA456tIsqbjzASA">tentative agreements</a> [AFP report] on the distribution of mining revenues from the region, a timeline for local elections, and the implementation of new regulations. Shortly after the deal was reached, President <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] urged the country&#39;s lawmakers to push for long-term resolution in the region in her annual <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/sonatext2008.asp">State of the Nation Address</a> (SONA) [text; government <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/">materials</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Senators <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/">Joe Lieberman</a> (ID-CT) and <a href="http://lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Lindsey Graham</a> (R-SC) [official websites] have introduced a <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/documents/ecdra.pdf">bill</a> [S. 3401 summary, PDF; <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=301719">press release</a>] designed to establish a procedure for all <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> petitions made by Guantanamo detainees. The Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2008 responds to recently raised concerns by US Attorney General <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Michael Mukasey</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>], who recently <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2008/ag-speech-0807213.html">stressed</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/congress-should-guide-courts-through.php">report</a>] that in his view it is inappropriate for the judicial branch to outline the process for trying terrorism suspects and that Congress and the Executive branch are best suited to form such policies. <br /><br />The bill states that: <blockquote>An application for habeas corpus filed under paragraph (1) by or on behalf of a covered individual&#8212; (A) may challenge the legality of the continued detention of the covered individual; and (B) may not include any other claim relating to the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of the covered individual or any other action against the United States or its agents.</blockquote> Under the bill, the government would have the burden of proving that the detainee is a valid <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatant</a> [JURIST news archive], the government could withhold classified information essential to national security in certain circumstances even though the detainee would have some discovery rights, and detainees could not be released into the US. In a statement issued Friday, Graham specifically said that the bill affords a solution to the <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas</span> &quot;problem&quot; created by the recent US Supreme Court decision in <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> that &quot;allows detainees due process without compromising national security.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/61773.htm">Richard Boucher</a> [official profile] Sunday <a href="http://srilanka.usembassy.gov/rab.html">called</a> [statement text] on the government of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST news archive] to provide better <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100620.htm">human rights protections</a> [2008 DOS human rights report] as it fights separatist rebels from the <a href="http://www.ltteps.org/">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [official website; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9242/">backgrounder</a>]. Speaking at a <a href="http://www.saarc-sec.org/main.php">South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation</a> [official website] conference in Colombo, Boucher pledged additional military and humanitarian support to the country, but said that the government could not sacrifice its democratic or humanitarian principles in the name of security:<blockquote>We are concerned about the human rights situation here. We have been concerned about some of the reports of abuses of the past that have not been fully investigated or have not had legal action taken at this point &#8211; such as the killings of aid workers. We have been concerned about the continuing reports of abductions, disappearances, some of the detentions of individuals, reports of intimidation against the media. All of these things need to be stopped. The government needs to take action to stop the perpetrators, and investigate and prosecute where necessary the people who have done these things. I think we will continue to focus attention on those problems and we will continue to call on the government, but also work with the government, to try to help a democratic government achieve the highest standards of democracy, because that is what the citizens expect of their government.</blockquote> Boucher said respecting basic rights would would improve the government&#39;s efficacy against the group, and called on local militias to disband so that official security forces could better implement the rule of law. Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSCOL5443320080803">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Daily News</font> has <a href="http://www.dailynews.lk/2008/08/04/sec01.asp">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The Sri Lankan government has been sporadically fighting with the LTTE since 1972 and has been widely criticized for ignoring basic human rights in the process. In July, <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused Sri Lanka of creating a <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/07/02/slanka19243.htm">de facto internment camp</a> [HRW press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sri-lanka-should-halt-internment-of.php">report</a>] for those fleeing areas controlled by the LTTE. In January, the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/courts%20of%20Law/THE%20SUPREME%20COURT%20OF%20SRI%20LANKA.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/sri-lanka-court-limits-government.php">ordered the government to stop</a> [JURIST report] the practice of detaining and searching large groups of civilians in LTTE-controlled areas. The same month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour urged the government to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/un-rights-chief-urges-sri-lanka-to.php">continue to respect rights</a> [JURIST report] in the region after the expiration of a 2002 ceasefire. In August 2007, HRW accused the Sri Lankan government of being responsible for a dramatic increase in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/sri-lanka-government-rights-abuses-on.php">unlawful killings and other human rights violations</a> [JURIST report].

Staff Sgt. Hal M. Warner and First Lt. Michael C. Behenna, members of the 1st Battalion, 327th Infantry stationed at Forward Operating Base Summerall approximately 130 miles north of Baghdad, are charged in the death of Ali Mansur Mohamed, a detainee originally thought to have been released from Coalition custody sometime around May 16. Warner, who also faces an additional charge of accessory after the fact, is scheduled to appear for an <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/html/NLSOGlakesArticle_32_investigations.htm">Article 32 preliminary hearing</a> [JAG backgrounder] August 15. A hearing date for Behenna had not yet been set. The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/world/middleeast/03iraq.html?ref=middleeast">more</a>.<br /><br />In March, US Marine Sgt. Ryan Weemer was <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Rel-08-001-080318.htm">charged</a> [press release] with one count of murder and one count of dereliction of duty for his involvement in the shooting death of a detained Iraqi insurgent during MNF-Iraq&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oif-phantom-fury-fallujah.htm">November 2004 offensive</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Investigation-Timeline.htm">Fallujah</a> [USMC timeline; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Fallujah">news archive</a>]. The charges against Weemer followed <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-marine-sergeant-re-charged-with.php">December 2007 charges</a> against Marine Sgt. Jermaine A. Nelson for murder and dereliction of duty, and <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ex-marine-charged-with-voluntary.php">August charges</a> [JURIST reports] against former Marine Sgt. Jose Nazario for voluntary manslaughter in connection with the same incident. In March 2007, a US military court-martial found 101st Airborne Staff Sgt. Raymond Girouard guilty of <a href="http://euphoricreality.com/wp-content/uploads/IronTriangleArt32Transcript.doc">three counts of negligent homicide</a> [Article 32 hearing transcript, DOC], but not guilty of premeditated murder for the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thar+OR+samarra">deaths of three Iraqi detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] held after a May 2006 raid in Thar Thar, a town near Samarra in the northern Salahuddin province of Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Provisional vote results for a Latvian <a href="http://web.cvk.lv/cvkserv/TN_2008_1/faktu_lapa_EN.pdf">referendum</a> [fact sheet, PDF] held Saturday on a proposed <a href="http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/29128.html">amendment</a> [text] to the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cvk.lv/cvkserv/constitution_2007.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF] that would have given voters the power to dissolve the country&#39;s parliament, the <a href="http://www.saeima.lv/">Saeima</a> [official websites], indicated Sunday that the referendum failed because of low voter turnout. The amendment specifically provides: <blockquote>Electors, in number comprising not less than one-tenth of the electorate, have the right to submit a fully elaborated draft of an amendment to the Constitution or of a law, or a draft decision about dissolution of the Saeima to the President, who shall submit it to the Saeima. If the Saeima does not adopt it without change as to its content, it shall then be put to a national referendum.</blockquote> According to the Latvian <a href="http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28862.html">Law on National Referendums and Legislative Initiatives</a> [text], the referendum would have needed the support of half the voting population. Provisional poll results showed that most of the electorate supported the movement, but that less than half participated in the vote. Official poll results are expected to be released later this month. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5glLYfLwkvbzbPJScdfqZPHN0851g">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/03/europe/EU-Latvia-Referendum.php">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Formerly part of the Soviet Union, Latvia <a href="/paperchase/2004/04/nato-inducts-seven-new-member-nations.htm">joined NATO</a> in April 2004, and a month later the country <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/live-webcast-european-union.htm">officially entered the European Union</a> (EU) [JURIST reports]. The Latvian parliament has since <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/latvia-lithuania-approve-eu-lisbon.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] the new <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], properly known as the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_ref_cm7294_eureformtreaty">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">official website</a>], but some voters remain discontented with the government and say that Latvian MPs do not act in accordance with voters&#39; wishes. Approval of the dissolution referendum would have marked the first time voters in an EU state would have had the power to dissolve their parliament directly.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in an Egyptian court Saturday convicted a prominent human rights activist and outspoken critic of President Hosni Mubarak <span style="font-style: italic;">in absentia</span> of defaming Egypt and sentenced him to two years in prison. <a href="http://www.unesco.org/most/ibrahim.htm">Saad Eddin Ibrahim</a> [profile], a dual US and Egyptian citizen who is a professor of sociology at the <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Pages/default.aspx">American University in Cairo</a> and who founded the <a href="http://www.eicds.org/index.htm">Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies</a> [academic websites] in Egypt, had been accused of defaming Egypt by criticizing its human rights practices and politics. Following the accusations, he decided to leave Egypt in 2007, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/20/AR2007082001500.html">writing</a> [text] in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span>: <blockquote>Sadly, this regime has strayed so far from the rule of law that, for my own safety, I have been warned not to return to Egypt. Regime insiders and those in Cairo&#39;s diplomatic circles have said that I will be arrested or worse. My family is worried, knowing that Egypt&#39;s jails contain some 80,000 political prisoners and that disappearances are routinely ignored or chalked up to accidents. My fear is that these abuses will spread if Egypt&#39;s allies and friends continue to stand by silently while this regime suppresses the country&#39;s democratic reformers.</blockquote> Ibrahim reportedly agreed to return to Egypt if he received assurances that he would not be immediately arrested. The judge Saturday said that Ibrahim could pay 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,890 USD) for bail, and that he would have the opportunity to appeal. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN238567.html">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iyZxEgOFVdXaa3a0SBQNoJSwwV3g">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In recent months, public critics of Egyptian government policies have been the target of multiple lawsuits for publicly discussing sensitive issues. In April, the former editor of weekly newspaper <a href="http://www.addustour.com/Default/Default.asp"><em>al-Dustour</em></a> [media website, in Arabic] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/egypt-court-sentences-newspaper-editor.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted on charges of spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about the health of President Mubarak in an August newspaper report. Last year, two journalists were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/egypt-court-convicts-opposition-leader.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em> of libel</a> [JURIST report] for writing a story about an illegal land transaction from the Ministry of Religious Endowments at a secret auction. Under Egyptian law, citizens may file lawsuits against individuals who make statements that harm society, and the accused can face criminal punishment if found guilty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US military said Saturday that it has released over 10,000 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Iraq+detainee">Iraqi detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] this past year. <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=16">Gen. David H. Petraeus</a> [official profile] was quoted by AP as saying the releases are part of a program to prepare detainees for re-integration into society. Petraeus also said the recidivism rate for released detainees is less than 1 percent. The announcement comes after a similar <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-reports-release-of-thousands-of-iraq.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] made last month that 9,000 detainees had been released thusfar in 2008. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNGORxlRDWfG2yDcOvs5bDQ_U-QD92A1NO80">more</a>. <br /><br />Coalition detention practices have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months. In July, Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4493999.stm">Foreign Minister Moshyar Zebarai</a> [BBC profile] indicated that disagreements between the US and Iraq, including disagreements over detainees, are <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-iraq-status-of-forces-agreement.php">still blocking a permanent Status of Forces Agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the two countries. In June, Physicians for Human Rights released a report purporting to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doctors-examine-ex-detainees-find.php">substantiate claims of abuse and torture</a> [JURIST report] by detainees held in US prisons in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+detainees">Iraq</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+detainees">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+detainees">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archives].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkey&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] has decided for the time being to cease its opposition to the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/european-rights-court-upholds-turkish.php">ban on wearing headscarves in public universities</a> [JURIST report], according to a party spokesman. The announcement made Thursday came a day after Turkey&#39;s <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkish-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/dnp-turkey.php">bid to ban</a> [JURIST reports] the AKP on the grounds that it was not respecting Turkey&#39;s strict secular principles. In June, the Constitutional Court rejected AKP-backed amendments to Turkey&#39;s <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/tu00000_.html">constitution</a> [text] designed to ease the ban on headscarves, finding that they, however, were too anti-secularist. AP has <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1828429,00.html?xid=rss-topstories">more</a>. <br /><br />The AKP and Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6900616.stm">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/turkish-pm-calls-for-end-to-headscarf.php">report</a>] had proposed the amendments in what they described as an attempt to provide equal access to higher education for women adhering to a stricter interpretation of Islam, but the pro-secular opposition <a href="http://www.chp.org.tr/index.php?module=news">Republican People&#39;s Party</a> [party website, in Turkish] <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkish-opposition-appeals.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Constitutional Court, saying maintenance of the broad ban was necessary to protect the country&#39;s separation of religion and state and alleging that the Islamist-based AKP was pushing a conservative religious agenda.

		<title>Seventh Circuit finds jurisdiction over related claims by more than 100 plaintiffs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/fdocs/docs.fwx?submit=showbr&shofile=08-8011_001.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that federal courts have jurisdiction over cases in which 100 or more plaintiffs bring related claims. The case involves 144 plaintiffs claiming injuries from chemicals released by the manufacturing practices of four companies. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that state courts should hear the matter because the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ002.109">Class Action Fairness Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/breaking-news-president-signs-class.php">report</a>] only gave federal courts jurisdiction over mass actions in which the plaintiffs proposed a joint trial, and that in this case the plaintiffs wanted a settlement or summary judgment, not a trial. The court Friday noted that no circuit had yet addressed this issue, stating: <blockquote>The question is not whether 100 or more plaintiffs answer a roll call in court, but whether the &#8220;claims&#8221; advanced by 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly. A trial of 10 exemplary plaintiffs, followed by application of issue or claim preclusion to 134 more plaintiffs without another trial, is one in which the claims of 100 or more persons are being tried jointly, and &sect;1332(d) thus brings the suit within federal jurisdiction.</blockquote> In 2005, the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] reported that there had been an <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/press/fttv03pr.htm">almost 80 percent decrease</a> [DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/doj-report-shows-decline-in-federal.php">report</a>] in the number of federal tort trials from 1985 to 2003. According to <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/fttv03.htm">Federal Tort Trials and Verdicts, 2002-03</a> [report abstract; <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/fttv03.pdf">text</a>, PDF], the decrease can be attributed to the growing use of alternative dispute resolution and the increased complexity and costs of trial. In addition, DOJ research showed that 98 percent of tort cases were settled without trial. Despite the study&#39;s findings, many people perceive lawsuits to be on the rise. In February of 2005, President George W. Bush signed the Class Action Fairness Act, which sends large class action suits to federal courts rather than state courts, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050218-11.html">commenting</a> [White House press release] that he wanted to &quot;[end] the lawsuit culture in our country.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bosnian Serb leader and former fugitive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=4079894&postID=6225787947966273028" edu="" q="Karadzic">news archive</a>] submitted a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/karadzic/presskit/files/ps-080731.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] Thursday to the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official site] claiming that irregularities surrounding his trial there on <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">war crimes charges</a> [amended indictment; case <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/latest-e/pressindex.htm">materials</a>] will prevent a fair trial. Karadzic was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">originally indicted</a> [text] by the court&#39;s prosecutor in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity until his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] in July. Karadzic is accused of numerous acts of genocide and crimes against humanity for overseeing the  <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. In his letter, Karadzic wrote: <blockquote>The first irregularity I would mention is the media witch-hunt which began in the Muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were Serbs. The international media continued that media witch-hunt and I was not in a position to reply adequately so that it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me. I believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself and excludes any possibility of regularity. However, many more serious irregularities have arisen from this, and no compensatory measures can neutralize them or bring the trial into the realm of regularity.</blockquote> Karadzic had earlier said he will <a href="/forumy/2008/07/karadzics-choice-why-war-criminals.php">represent himself</a> [JURIST Forum] in defending against the charges, and faces life in prison if convicted. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/world/europe/02hague.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">more</a>. The Press Association has <a href="http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gUlHCIbmPJmniBbyh3gRPB-SYYzQ">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Karadzic was transfered to the ICTY Wednesday, after his lawyer&#39;s tactic to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-karadzic-appeals.php">delay sending the appeal</a> [JURIST report] failed to prevent his extradition from Serbia, where he had been hiding. His capture has been a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1275e.htm">major goal of the ICTY</a> [press release], and follows the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ex-bosnian-serb-police-chief.php">June arrest</a> [JURIST report] of former Bosnian Serb police commander <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/stojan_zupljanin_176.html">Stojan Zupljanin</a> [Trial Watch profile].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on Friday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/05-5430-1130991.pdf">reversed a lower court&#39;s grant of summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] against Cheryl Steele, a former economist at the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] who had filed a lawsuit alleging a hostile work environment and unlawful retaliation against her in violation of <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [text].  The lawsuit follows many other claims that the USDA discriminates against African Americans not only in employment situations, but also in administering aid programs. In March, several US lawmakers <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/01/america/NA-GEN-US-USDA-vs-Auditors.php">accused the USDA of obstructing an investigation</a> [AP report] into patterns of discrimination after USDA officials expelled government auditors sent to evaluate the Department&#39;s practices. The DC Circuit commented on its lack of confidence in the evidence available due to &quot;the tangled record on appeal,&quot; but was able to find genuine issues of material fact: <blockquote>We do note...that at least four alleged incidents that Steele describes as retaliatory -- the denial of the Y2K award, the issuance of the lowest performance rating of her career combined with the lowest performance bonus in her branch, the denial of the special act award, and the false report to the D.C. Office of Unemployment Compensation contesting her unemployment benefits -- involve conduct that this court or the Supreme Court has already indicated can support a retaliation claim.</blockquote>The passage of the new Farm Bill in June enabled the Virginia-based National Black Farmers Association to go forward with a landmark <a href="http://www.blackfarmers.org/pdf/bfbillpasses.pdf">discrimination case</a> [NBFA press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/black-farmers-allege-usda.php">report</a>] against the USDA.  The legislation included a <a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/121707/D8TJEU0O0.shtml">provision</a> [AP file report] that expressly permits new claims of improper discrimination in the allocation of USDA resources, including loans, disaster relief, and other resources.  The new Farm Bill also reopens the class-action suit to farmers who were left out of a 1999 settlement after missing a filing deadline and thousands more who argue that the terms of the settlement were inadequate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges for California&#39;s Fourth District Court of Appeal in San Diego <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/D050333.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; case <a href="http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=41&doc_id=467008&doc_no=D050333">materials</a>] Thursday that challenged provisions of California&#39;s <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/default.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials] are constitutional and do not violate the federal <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text]. The counties of San Diego and San Bernardino had argued that certain provisions of the MMP were unconstitutional as violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlevi.html">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] because the MMP was a barrier to the enforcement of the CSA. San Bernardino county also argued that the requirement that the counties issue cards to those eligible for medical marijuana who request the cards was unconstitutional. The trial court <a href="http://www.aclusandiego.org/article_downloads/000249/SD%20Superior%20Court%20Nevitt%20Ruling.pdf">rejected the counties&#39; claims</a> [opinion, PDF], holding that the state laws did not require conduct that violated federal laws. The appeals court upheld the trial court&#39;s ruling, holding: <blockquote>We are unpersuaded by Counties&#39; arguments that the identifications laws, standing alone, present significant obstacles to the purposes of the CSA. For example, Counties assert that identification cards make it &quot;easier for individuals to use, possess, and cultivate marijuana&quot; in violation of federal laws, without articulating why the absence of such a card--which is entirely voluntary and not a prerequisite to the exemptions available for such underlying conduct--renders the underlying conduct significantly more difficult.<br /><br />Counties also appear to assert the identification card laws present a significant obstacle to the CSA because the bearer of an identification card will not be arrested by California&#39;s law enforcement officers despite being in violation of the CSA. However, the unstated predicate of this argument is that the federal government is entitled to conscript a state&#39;s law enforcement officers into enforcing federal enactments, over the objection of that state, and this entitlement will be obstructed to the extent the identification card precludes California&#39;s law enforcement officers from arresting medical marijuana users. The argument falters on its own predicate because Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.</blockquote> The <span style="font-style: italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/01/BAQH1237M8.DTL">more</a>.<br /><br />About a dozen states permit the use of medical marijuana. The latest state to approve its use is New Mexico with the governor&#39;s April 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/new-mexico-governor-signs-medical.php">signing</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://legis.state.nm.us/lcs/_session.asp?chamber=S&type=++&number=523&Submit=Search&year=07">Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Senate Bill 523 text and history], legalizing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] in the treatment of certain &quot;eligible conditions and symptoms.&quot; Eligible conditions include chronic or debilitating diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and glaucoma. Nonetheless, The US Supreme Court&#39;s 2005 decision in <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html">Gonzales v. Raich</a> [opinion text; Duke Law <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2004/ashvrai.html">case backgrounder</a>] upheld Congress&#39;s power to criminalize the growth and personal use of marijuana for medical purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced Friday that it will pay former US Army germ-warfare researcher <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A49717-2003Sep9?language=printer">Dr. Steven Hatfill</a> [WP profile] $2.8 million to settle his claim that the DOJ violated the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm">US Privacy Act</a> [text] by providing information about him to journalists during its investigation of the 2001 <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ecih/anthraxinfo/public/publicthreat_attacks.htm">anthrax attacks</a> [GWU backgrounder], in which he was at one point named a &quot;person of interest.&quot;  The DOJ initially <a href="/pdf/hatfillsettlement.pdf">agreed to seek a settlement</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/doj-hatfill-anthrax-settlement-may-moot.php">report</a>] in late June after Hatfill <a href="http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/hatfill/hatfillash82603cmp.pdf">filed his lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/bioterror-expert-can-question.php">report</a>].  The settlement may moot a contempt case against former <em>USA Today</em> reporter and past JURIST student staff member <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=toni+locy">Toni Locy</a> [JURIST news archive], who is now awaiting a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Locy had refused to disclose her related sources in discovery, arguing that the information Hatfill was seeking was not central to his lawsuit. In a June <a href="/pdf/hatfillletter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the Court of Appeals informing it of the settlement, Hatfill lawyer Christopher Wright said that Locy&#39;s evidence was no longer needed by his client. Also Friday, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-anthrax1-2008aug01,0,4086498,full.story">reported</a> [text] that government scientist and biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins apparently committed suicide after learning that the DOJ was going to prosecute him in connection with the anthrax attacks.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=695358">more</a>.<br /><br />In March, US District Judge Reggie Walton found Locy in <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2003cv1793-224">contempt of court</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-holds-anthrax-reporter-in.php">report</a>] for not disclosing her sources and ordered her to pay a fine of $500 a day, increasing to $1,000 a day after one week and then up to $5,000 a day after two weeks, the costs of which could not be covered by her former employer. Locy obtained an <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-blocks-contempt.php">emergency stay</a> of that order from the Court of Appeals and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/anthrax-reporter-challenges-contempt-of.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] on the merits of the sanctions were heard in May. The appeals court has yet to make a formal ruling on the status of the contempt case in light of the Hatfill settlement, but Locy said that she and her lawyers were hopeful that the deal would end the matter. The US Senate recently considered a proposed federal <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:s2035rs.txt.pdf">reporter shield law</a> [S. 2035 text, PDF; bill <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.02035:">materials</a>] that news agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/proposed-us-media-shield-bill-prompts.php">said</a> [JURIST report] would be beneficial in cases such as Locy&#39;s, but the Senate <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2008_record&page=S7710&position=all">tabled the bill</a> [text, PDF] without a vote on Wednesday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on Thursday obtained and made available a government <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/36215res20080731.html">handbook</a> [PDF download; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/36219prs20080731.html">press release</a>] issued to the lawyers defending the illegal immigrants arrested in May during the massive raid on an <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] meatpacking plant in Iowa. The document contains pre-printed forms with blanks for the defendants&#39; names, along with instructions for waiving constitutional rights and entering guilty pleas, but gave no guidance on pleading not guilty.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/24immig.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5065&partner=MYWAY&adxnnlx=1211631217-8ET1vBpRQKa9AU0yQaz5Vg">Nearly 300 workers were sentenced to jail time and probation</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</font> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">report</a>] after making their pleas over the course of just four days in temporary courtrooms at a local fairground. The manual provides a word-by-word script for judges, and was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-immig1-2008aug01,0,2416991.story">created before the raid even took place</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report], facts that some say prove the Department of Justice (DOJ) improperly pushed the immigrants to plead guilty. <br /><br />The release of the manual comes as the latest condemnation of the legal proceedings stemming from the raid, in which.  Last month, the House of Representatives <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">Committee on the Judiciary</a> [official website]heard <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_072408.html">testimony</a> [hearing materials] from lawyers and professors who argued that the government process used to arrest and convict the illegal immigrants in Iowa was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/convictions-of-iowa-illegal-immigrants.php">illegal and violated due process</a> [JURIST report].  Representatives from both the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Rhodes080724.pdf">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Forman080724.pdf">ICE</a> [testimony transcripts, PDF] defended the government&#39;s arrest and conviction processes, saying that the immigrants&#39; constitutional rights were strictly applied.  The <a href="http://www.aila.org/">American Immigration Lawyers Association</a> [advocacy website] has criticized the government for severity of the charges and alleged <a href="http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=25499">breaches of due process for the accused</a> [letter, PDF], but court-appointed defense lawyers for the workers said their clients were motivated to plead guilty because they did not want to risk receiving a minimum two-year sentence if found guilty after a trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Senate passed a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h4040pcs.txt.pdf">bill</a> [HR 4040 text, PDF; Senate <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h4040eas.txt.pdf">amendments</a>, PDF] late on Thursday designed to increase the safety of children&#39;s products by mandating new safety rules and restricting the kinds of materials which may be used.  The legislation establishes a maximum level of lead, bans certain plastics, requires independent product testing and labeling, and strengthens the authority of the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a> (CPSC) [official website]. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00193">89-3</a>, after having passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2008&rollnumber=543">424-1</a> [roll calls] on Wednesday. The bill notes: <blockquote>The Commission shall &#8212; (A) in consultation with representatives of consumer groups, juvenile product manufacturers, and independent child product engineers and experts, examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary consumer product safety standards for durable infant or toddler product; and (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, promulgate consumer product safety rules that &#8212; (i) are substantially the same as such voluntary standards; or (ii) are more stringent than such voluntary standards, if the Commission determines that more stringent standards would further reduce the risk of injury associated with such products.</blockquote> The bill covers products designed for children 12 years old and younger, and also places restrictions on certain Internet and magazine sales. CPSC Acting Chairman Nancy Nord <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml08/08349.html">applauded the bill&#39;s passage</a> [press release], saying that while the agency will need increased funding, it will make sure that &quot;all the provisions in the legislation are implemented fully, fairly and in the way that best serves consumers.&quot; President George W. Bush has said that he will <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080731-10.html">approve the bill</a> [press statement]. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080103007.html?hpid=moreheadlines">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hk2PsdpRbmKmS0Wm45tU1HU5DSawD9295RV00">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In October 2007, a public Michigan pension fund <a href="http://www.gelaw.com/Mattel.cfm">filed a derivative action</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/mattel-board-sued-for-breach-of.php">report</a>] alleging misconduct by <a href="http://www.mattel.com/index.asp?f=true">Mattel</a> [corporate website] for failing to report toy defects to federal regulators. Mattel had recalled about 21 million toys between August and October of that year because they contained illegal lead paint or magnets that could become detached and cause injuries to children. Since announcing the recalls, Mattel has also been sued in several class action and personal injury lawsuits filed by consumers alleging harm to children who came in contact with the recalled toys and requesting that Mattel pay for testing of the children.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The US <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073711p.pdf">affirmed</a> [decision; PDF] a decision to dismiss claims filed by fifteen current and former inmates alleging that various employees of the <a href="http://www.cor.state.pa.us/">Pennsylvania Department of Corrections</a> (DOC) [official website] violated their constitutional rights when they confiscated inmates&#39; legal materials.  After a DOC inmate filed fraudulent liens against a state court judge, a superintendent and the DOC secretary in June 2005, the DOC banned all materials related to the copyrighting of names, the filing of liens, and filings under the Uniform Commercial Code.  Upon a search of the plaintiff inmates&#39; cells, prison officials discovered these contraband documents and subsequently confiscated all of the inmates&#39; legal materials, including items that had not been designated as contraband.  The inmates filed suit, alleging that the seizures violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendment&#39;s</a> guarantee of Due Process as well as their right to access the courts and possess publications and legal materials under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [LII texts].  The Court of Appeals dismissed the inmates&#39; Due Process claims, noting that prison officials provided the inmates with three separate opportunities to reclaim their non-contraband property following the seizures, explaining that:<blockquote>[A]n unauthorized intentional deprivation of property by prison officials does not violate the Due Process Clause if a meaningful postdeprivation remedy for the loss is available.</blockquote>  In affirming the lower court&#39;s determination that the DOC&#39;s confiscation did not unreasonably deprive the inmates of their right to possess publications and legal materials, the Third Circuit found that:<blockquote>In light of the DOC&#8217;s experience with the inmate&#8217;s June 2005 filing, which demonstrated that fraudulent UCC filings are easy to file but burdensome to remove, along with the research that informed their judgment on this policy, we conclude that the defendants&#8217; decision to engage in preemptive action in this case was reasonable</blockquote>The court dismissed the inmates&#39; claims that the seizures blocked their access to the courts, ruling that their initial pleadings were insufficient to support a claim.  The court found that &quot;the plaintiffs&#8217; claim rested solely on the ground that the defendants confiscated their legal materials, contraband and non-contraband alike&quot; and did not show an actual injury or that the inmates possessed no other remedy to compensate them for their lost claims.<br /><br />Jurisdictions across the country have seen an increase in the malicious filing of fraudulent liens, which can cause great hardship for the affected parties. Some experts attribute the rise in such filings to a bizarre and convoluted new scam known as <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=74">&quot;redemption&quot;</a> [SPLC backgrounder], in which participants are told that every American has a &quot;strawman&quot; account created by the the US government.  Participants pay large sums to obtain fraudulent instructions said to be grounded in the UCC.  These materials claim to show how to access the government money in that strawman account, and participants are encouraged to exact financial revenge against government officials.  In February, a Texas inmate was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/txe/news_release/news/EDTX_DAVIS020708.html">sentenced</a> [DOJ press release] to 12 years in prison after he filed fraudulent liens against a US District Judge and Assistant US Attorney involved in the prosecution of his initial drug convictions.

The coup&#39;s apparent leader, Gen.

Aziz had previously supported Abdallahi, but the two split after Abdallahi made political concessions to conservative Muslim groups.  Aziz will now head a new state council, according to a statement broadcast by a state-run television station. The coup overturns the first democratically elected government in the country in more than 20 years.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080806/D92CQQH03.html">more</a>.<br /><br />This is the second coup in the country since 2005.  That year, a junta led by Aziz took temporary control of the country while then-president Taya, who had allied with the US in the war on terror and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/23/backlash.forusally.ap/">increased law enforcement efforts against extremists</a> [AP report], was out of the country.

The <span style="font-style: italic;">Guardian</span> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/06/osamabinladen.guantanamo?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001, when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until July.

In July, the military court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] launched a new <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/ice-scheduled-departure-program.htm">program</a> [fact sheet; <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/0807/080731washington.htm">press release</a>] Tuesday that allows certain illegal immigrants to coordinate their removal from the US with ICE without the risk of home raids, arrest or detention. The Scheduled Departure Program, a pilot program that will run through August 22 in <a href="http://www.ice.gov/scheduled-departure/index.htm">five major cities</a> [program overview], is designed for illegal immigrants without criminal records who have ignored official removal orders. According to the ICE press release: <blockquote>The agency recognizes there are those less inclined to accept the intentions of such a compassionately conceived enforcement initiative, but remains committed to providing sensible alternatives that balance the welfare of the individuals and families in question with its clear obligation to uphold the law.<br /><br />The Scheduled Departure Program will not alter a participant&#39;s immigration status or provide any immigration benefit. The program is not a form of voluntary departure or voluntary return. Participants will continue to have a final order of removal, deportation or exclusion.</blockquote> ICE stressed that illegal immigrants without formal removal orders, those with criminal records and those who pose a threat to national security would not qualify for the program and would be detained, but <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/Scheduled-Departure-Brochure-PDF-English.pdf">said</a> [program brochure, PDF] that participation by those who qualified would ease the transition process and the impact on the immigrants&#39; families. ICE also began an ad campaign in the five participating cities, but critics have said the program will be ineffective because eligible immigrants will not voluntarily surrender. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5prhLjHvlhYqvnvbzyaGXUtL1WAD92CHKV02">more</a>.<br /><br />ICE maintains a number of additional <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/immigration_enforcement_initiatives.htm">initiatives</a> [fact sheet] to combat illegal immigration. In May, 270 illegal immigrants arrested during an ICE-led raid at an <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] meatpacking plant in Iowa were each <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">sentenced to five months in prison</a> [JURIST report] and 27 more received probation after pleading guilty to the use of false immigration documents. ICE also carried out a raid in California the same month targeting 495 people who had ignored deportation orders, resulting in the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/080523losangeles.htm">arrest of more than 900 illegal immigrants</a> [ICE press release]. In general, US immigration prosecutions continued to increase in March 2008, jumping nearly 50 percent from the previous month and nearly 75 percent from the previous year, according to a <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/188/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/whatsnew/email.080617.html">press release</a>] released by the <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/">Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse</a> (TRAC) [official website] at Syracuse University. TRAC attributed the increase to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/06/02/GR2008060200068.html">Operation Streamline</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> backgrounder], a joint federal program under which federal prosecutors levy minor charges against illegal immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The state of Texas executed Mexican national <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights/2005/05/insights050531.html">Jose Ernesto Medellin</a> [ASIL backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medellin">news archive</a>] late Tuesday evening after the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/medellin-opinion-8-5-08.pdf">narrowly refused</a> [decision, PDF] to stay his <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/statistics/deathrow/drowlist/medellin.jpg">sentence</a> [information sheet]. Medellin&#39;s appeal was based on a July <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/139/14637.pdf?PHPSESSID=39cdd63a2169a8c75c02f57dcf6db222">order</a> [order and press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/texas-governor-state-not-bound-by-icj.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], which had attempted to halt his execution and mandated a review to determine whether Medellin and four other Mexican nationals on death row in Texas were inappropriately denied the chance to speak with Mexican counselor officers in violation of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [PDF text].  Medellin had argued that his execution should be stayed because either state or federal bodies could decide to recognize the order in the future, but the Supreme Court majority disagreed, saying the possibility was too remote to warrant a stay:<blockquote>The beginning premise for any stay, and indeed for the assumption that Congress or the legislature might seek to intervene in this suit, must be that petitioner&#8217;s confession was obtained unlawfully. This is highly unlikely as a matter of domestic or international law. Other arguments seeking to establish that a violation of the Convention constitutes grounds for showing the invalidity of the state court judgment, for instance because counsel was inadequate, are also insubstantial... The Department of Justice of the United States is well aware of these proceedings and has not chosen to seek our intervention. Its silence is no surprise: The United States has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access.</blockquote>The execution was carried out despite opposition from international leaders including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, along with the Mexican government, which had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/mexico-argues-icj-should-stay-us.php">appealed the sentence to ICJ</a> [JURIST report] in June. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gpkdpV0pGSS_ozv30DC1F1QkVd5wD92CMU7O0">more</a>.

Critics of Medellin&#39;s appeal often point to the fact that he failed to assert his status as a Mexican national during his trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/062140.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a radio talk-show host&#39;s inflammatory remarks about a company which conducted interrogations for the US military at&nbsp;<a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive] were protected under the First Amendment.  In 2005, <a href="http://www.caci.com/">CACI International</a> [corporate website] filed a defamation suit in federal district court against <a href="http://www.therandirhodesshow.com/">Randi Rhodes</a> and her radio station, <a href="http://airamerica.com/">Air America Radio</a> [official websites], for comments that Rhodes made on the air accusing CACI of &quot;among other things, torture, rape, murder, and misrepresenting its authority. . . at Abu Ghraib&quot; and likening CACI and other independent contractors operating in Iraq to those &quot;that operated in apartheid South Africa.&quot;  In affirming the lower court&#39;s grant of summary judgment to Rhodes and Air America, the Fourth Circuit court explained that:<blockquote>The conduct of the military and its designated civilian surrogates during wartime is a matter of the highest public concern, and speech critical of those responsible for military operations is well within the constitutionally protected area of free discussion. ...Such a commentator must simply maintain a standard of care such as to avoid knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth.</blockquote>  The court declined to find that the comments were made with actual malice because Rhodes relied on a number of sources, including the <a href="http://www.npr.org/iraq/2004/prison_abuse_report.pdf">Taguba</a> and <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2004/d20040825fay.pdf">Fay Jones</a> [texts, PDF] reports, which provided evidence to support her allegations and prevented CACI from proving that the statements were made with reckless disregard for the truth.  The court also dismissed CACI&#39;s defamation claims concerning a number of Rhodes&#39; comments, including the reference to apartheid, on the grounds that they did not assert actual facts against the contractor and as such allowed for &quot;rhetorical hyperbole and other types of imaginative or exaggerated expression.&quot;  AP has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/8ec34cf801ee334170b2541df154b63d.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, four former Abu Ghraib detainees <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-files-four-new-abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuits-targeting-military-contractor">filed lawsuits</a> [CCR materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ex-abu-ghraib-detainees-sue-military.php">report</a>] against CACI and another private contractor, <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/">L-3 Communications</a> [corporate website], alleging torture, war crimes and civil conspiracy.  The actions followed a similar <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/abu-ghraib-ex-detainee-files-torture.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] filed in May by an ex-detainee who alleged that the contractors engaged in torture and conspiracy at the prison.

The <span style="font-style:italic;">Epoch Times</span> has <a href="http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/world/spanish-court-to-probe-chinese-on-tibet-deaths-2194.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Under Spanish law, the country&#39;s courts can exercise <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/ij0606/">universal jurisdiction</a> [HRW backgrounder] to try those suspected of genocide and other serious human rights offenses even if they occur abroad.  Chinese officials have blamed the exiled <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/">Dalai Lama</a> [personal website] for organizing the protests by Buddhist monks in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in March. China says that 19 people died after skirmishes between pro-Tibet protesters and Chinese authorities during the demonstrations, but the <a href="http://www.tibet.com/">Tibetan government-in-exile</a> [official website] said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/tibet-government-in-exile-says-130.php">130 had died</a> [JURIST report]. The Dalai Lama has denied accusations that he was behind the riots and has said that he supports true autonomy for Tibet, not outright independence.

According to the complaint:<blockquote>AAFIA SIDDIQUI, the defendant, who will be first brought to and arrested in the Southern District of New York, unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly did use a deadly and dangerous weapon and did forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, and interfere with a person designated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1114, namely, officers and employees of the FBI and the United States armed services, while engaged in and on account of the performance of official duties, to wit, SIDDIQUI obtained a United States Army Officer&#39;s M-4 rifle and fired it at officers and employees of the FBI and the United States armed services.</blockquote>If convicted, she could face 20 years in prison on each charge.

The <font style="font-style: italic;">Times</font> has <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4463680.ece">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Siddiqui&#39;s family has insisted that she is not an al-Qaeda agent and that the FBI has publicized misleading information about her.  They say that Siddiqui, a former student at Brandeis University and MIT in Boston, may have been a victim of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] after she vanished from Karachi, Pakistan in 2003.  Family lawyer <a href="http://www.sharplaw.biz/index_profiles_ews.html">Elaine Whitfield Sharp</a> [firm profile] alleged that Siddiqui may have been wrongly detained and tortured at Bagram air base in Afghanistan.

Ibrahim has been a&nbsp;prominent human rights activist and outspoken critic of Egypt&#39;s President <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.eg/html/the_president.html">Hosni Mubarak</a>&nbsp;[official profile], and has dual US and Egyptian citizenship. He is a professor of sociology at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/Pages/default.aspx">American University in Cairo</a>&nbsp;and founded the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eicds.org/index.htm">Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies</a>&nbsp;[academic websites] in Egypt, but left the country because of the charges and was tried <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span>. &nbsp;On his trial and&nbsp;sentencing, a&nbsp;spokesman&nbsp;for the State Department said:<blockquote>We are disappointed by the recent conviction in Egypt of democracy activist Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim.&nbsp;On August 2, Dr. Ibrahim was convicted of harming Egypt&#8217;s reputation through his writings in the foreign press and was sentenced to two years in prison. Lawsuits should not be used to undermine the principles of freedom of expression. We strongly advocate &#8211; in all countries &#8211; the protection of civil and political rights, including freedom of speech and due process.</blockquote>Ibrahim has said he will only return to the country if he is promised that he will not be arrested, and the Egyptian government has said that if he returns he may post bail to avoid imprisonment while he appeals the conviction. AFP has <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.eg/html/the_president.html">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7540986.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In recent months, public critics of Egyptian government policies have been the target of multiple lawsuits for publicly discussing sensitive issues. In April, the former editor of weekly newspaper <a href="http://www.addustour.com/Default/Default.asp"><em>al-Dustour</em></a> [media website, in Arabic] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/egypt-court-sentences-newspaper-editor.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted on charges of spreading &quot;rumors&quot; about the health of President Mubarak in an August newspaper report. Last year, two journalists were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/egypt-court-convicts-opposition-leader.php">convicted of libel <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] for writing a story about an illegal land transaction involving the Ministry of Religious Endowments at a secret auction. Under Egyptian law, citizens may file lawsuits against individuals who make statements that harm society, and the accused can face criminal punishment if found guilty.

In December 2007, South Africa&#39;s <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/">National Prosecuting Authority</a> [official website] served an <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/south-africa-prosecutors-charge-zuma.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] on Zuma, charging him with corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering.    Zuma has challenged the charges against him, saying they are part of a politically motivated effort by outgoing <a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/main.asp?include=president/profile.htm">President Thabo Mbeki</a> [official profile] to upset his plans to run in the 2009 presidential election. Zuma supporters have long protested the trial and have <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jaoTEK2Tr3MYBY3gqP60lSXAzJjgD92C6R600">threatened violence</a> [AP report] if he is convicted, but moderates have said the threats only&nbsp;<a href="http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=6&art_id=nw20080805150317153C951423">further impugn</a> [Independent Online report] the judicial system.

From South Africa, the <font style="font-style:italic;">Times</font> has <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=815893">local coverage.<br /></a><br />Last week, the <a href="http://www.concourt.gov.za/">South African Constitutional Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/cgisirsi/20080731170415/SIRSI/0/520/J-CCT89-07">rejected a motion</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/south-africa-court-rejects-zuma-bid-to.php">report</a>] by Zuma to exclude evidence from his upcoming corruption trial. Zuma had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that evidence seized in 2005 raids by the <a href="http://www.npa.gov.za/ReadContent424.aspx">Directorate of Special Investigations</a> [official backgrounder; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/435550.stm">report</a>] should be thrown out because the raids violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial. The court upheld the validity of the warrants used in the raids, confirming a November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/south-africa-high-court-allows-zuma.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal.  The court also <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/uhtbin/hyperion-image/J-CCT90-07">held</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/zuma9007.htm">summary</a>] that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/south-africa-court-prosecutors-may-seek.php">papers obtained by the Mauritius government</a> [JURIST report] believed to document meetings between Zuma and arms manufacturer Thint were also admissible.  Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Meetings between <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees and representatives of their governments may have been recorded, according to a Tuesday <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/04/AR2008080402321.html?hpid%3Dtopnews">report</a> [text].  In 2002 and 2003, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> advised foreign delegations that their meetings would be videotaped despite public assertions by the US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official websites] that it did not regularly record such sessions.  Some detainees have alleged that they were threatened with violence or torture during the meetings, but DOD officials has refused to say whether interview footage exists.  The DOD would not say which countries had sent agents to Guantanamo, but e-mails obtained by the <em>Post</em> listed Bahrain, Belgium, France and Russia among them.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080805/D92BTKKO0.html">more</a>.<br /><br />The DOD previously denied that detainee meetings were routinely recorded, but later admitted it had footage of a meeting between Canadian agents and Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>].  Last month, lawyers for Khadr released an <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/video/vs?id=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715&ids=RTGAM.20080715.wvkhadr0715,RTGAM.20080710.wharper_khadr0710">excerpt</a> [video; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/khadr-guantanamo-interrogation-video.php">report</a>]  of a 2003 interrogation of Khadr conducted by Canadian officials, marking the first time Guantanamo interrogation footage has been available to the public. The eight-minute clip is part of seven hours of footage given to lawyers after the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc28/2008scc28.html">ruled</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/canada-supreme-court-rules-for-khadr-in.php">report</a>] in May that Khadr had the right under the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text] to see confidential documents and videos compiled by Canadian officials.  Last week, Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/hamdan-interrogation-video-shown-after_23.php">walked out of the courtroom</a> [JURIST report] at his military commission trial, refusing to watch a video depicting one of his interrogation sessions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Navy Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler, lawyer for Canadian Guantanamo detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khadr.php">news archive</a>], said on Monday that he has filed three separate motions to dismiss the case against his client due to alleged government misconduct. In the first motion, Kuebler alleged that government policy encouraged interrogators to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/guantanamo-interrogators-instructed-to.php">destroy notes</a> [JURIST report] that could have been used to help his client and that evidence of the policy was later covered up. In the second, Kuebler stated that a legal advisor to the military commission hearing Khadr&#39;s case has been shown to favor the prosecution and has already been removed from the case against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [JURIST news archive] for bias. In the third, Kuebler argued that the government had inappropriately <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/chief-guantanamo-judge-insists.php">removed a judge</a> [JURIST report] in the case because he had made decisions favorable to Khadr. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5il5LCDHbI5AJxB88NybC5-JGwgEgD92BP0M80">more</a>. The <em>Globe and Mail</em> has <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080804.wKhadr05/BNStory/National/home?cid=al_gam_mostemail">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Khadr&#39;s trial is currently <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-judge-sets-trial-date-for.php">scheduled to begin</a> [JURIST report] in October and he could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted on <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Apr2007/Khadrreferral.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canadian-guantanamo-detainee-omar-khadr.php">report</a>] of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The prosecution for the military commissions trial of <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSN0532374620080805?sp=true">moved</a> [Reuters report] Tuesday for the judge to recall the jury and issue new instructions on what constitutes a war crime. Prosecutors said that the instructions given by presiding judge Navy Capt. Keith Allred were flawed, but defense lawyers responded that if that were the case, the judge would have to declare a mistrial. Allred rejected the prosecution&#39;s claim, noting that even if he had issued flawed instructions, the motion came after the start of jury deliberations and thus was invalid.  The <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/miami-dade/breaking-news/story/612569.html">jury</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> report], made up of six military officers, was selected on July 21, and the trial lasted for two weeks before deliberations began Monday. Hamdan is <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2007/Hamdan_Charges.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF] with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism.  The <font style="font-style: italic;">Miami Herald</font> has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/story/628780.html">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</font> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/04/AR2008080401269.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001 when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until July. A judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-delay-hamdan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by Hamdan&#39;s lawyers to stay his trial, ruling that a civilian court should refrain from reviewing the case until the military commission issues a final judgment. In July, Allred <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case.  If convicted, Hamdan could face life in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Monday <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/04/colomb19533.htm">criticized</a> [press release] proposed constitutional amendments put forth by <a href="http://web.presidencia.gov.co/presidente/">Colombian President Alvaro Uribe</a> [official profile, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3214685.stm">profile</a>] that would strip the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ramajudicial.gov.co:7777/csj_portal/jsp/frames/index.jsp?idsitio=3">High Court</a> [official backgrounder] of the authority to investigate sitting legislators for alleged <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/21/AR2007052101672_pf.html">relationships with right-wing paramilitaries</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report]. The amendments would require that cases against current members of Congress first go to a local Bogota court and would limit the Supreme Court to hearing appeals.  HRW accused Uribe of pushing the legislation to help political allies who have been accused of collaboration with paramilitary groups:<blockquote>The politicians imprisoned as a result of investigations initiated by the Supreme Court include Senator Mario Uribe, a cousin of the president and one of his closest political allies for many years. They also include Senator Carlos Garc&iacute;a, the president of Uribe&#8217;s party, &#8220;la U,&#8221; whose arrest the court ordered on July 25, 2008. As a result of the investigations, Uribe and various cabinet members have repeatedly launched attacks against the Supreme Court, making questionable accusations and even calling justices on the phone to inquire about pending cases.</blockquote>Uribe has argued that the amendments would prevent defendants from being tried by the same body which conducted the investigation against them. HRW acknowledged that these functions should be separate but remained skeptical that the amendments were the proper way to effect this change.<br /><br />Uribe has frequently clashed with the courts, particularly in matters concerning the country&#39;s long feud with right-wing anti-government paramilitaries.  In May 2007, the Colombian high court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/colombia-high-court-orders-lawmakers.php">ordered the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of five congressmen for alleged ties to the <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/auc.cfm">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CDI backgrounder]. All of the political representatives were supporters of Uribe. Uribe said that any ties to paramilitary forces will not be tolerated, saying that members of government will be removed from office if it seems they have links to paramilitaries.  In March 2007, a Colombian judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/colombia-ex-intelligence-chief-released.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of ex-intelligence chief <a href="http://www.ciponline.org/colombia/blog/archives/000242.htm">Jorge Noguera</a> [CIP backgrounder] because no formal charges had been made against him. Noguera, who was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/colombia-ex-intelligence-chief-arrested.php">arrested</a>  earlier that month, is accused of murder and conspiracy for <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-ruling-may-disrupt.php">allegedly contracting with illegal paramilitary groups</a> [JURIST reports].  In May, the <a href="http://www.ramajudicial.gov.co/csj_portal/jsp/contenido/plantillaFrame.jsp?idsitio=2">Constitutional Court</a> [official backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-ruling-may-disrupt.php">threw out</a> a part of the controversial 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/colombia-passes-bill-intended-to.php">Justice and Peace Law</a> [JURIST reports] approved by Uribe, which gave lesser punishments to paramilitary leaders who voluntarily disarm.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George Bush on Monday <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080804-2.html">signed</a> [press release] into law the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c110:2:./temp/~c110SXTqhp::">Libyan Claims Resolution Act</a> [text], which allows the Secretary of State to settle remaining civil claims brought by US citizens against Libya for bombings allegedly carried out by groups linked to the government in the late 1980s.  The bill is seen as an effort to improve relations between the two countries and would provide Libya immunity from civil suits brought against it for supporting terrorism, but would still require it to provide some compensation to the victims.  The bill upholds settlements that some victims have already made with the country, but has been <a href="http://www.crowell.com/NewsEvents/PressRelease.aspx?id=214">criticized by victims&#39; advocates</a> [press release] for invalidating an existing court&nbsp;<a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv2026-88">decision</a>&nbsp;[PDF text; JURIST&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-judge-orders-libya-to-pay-6b-to.php">report</a>] that had ordered the Libyan government and six Libyan officials to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crowell.com/PracticeAreas/Page.aspx?id=60&cid=366">pay more than $6 billion in damages</a>&nbsp;[plaintiff press release] to families of those Americans who died in a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3163621.stm">1989 air plane bombing</a>&nbsp;[BBC backgrounder]. Reuters has <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnBAN523790.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In May, the US and Libya <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-and-libya-discussing-expedited.php">agreed to seek resolution</a> to the outstanding claims against the country after President Bush had already <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bush-administration-seeks-to-exempt.php">urged Congress</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] to exempt the country from provisions of&nbsp;the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.4986:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008</a> [HR 4986 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bush-administration-seeks-to-exempt.php">report</a>], which otherwise allows victims of state-sponsored terrorism to sue for that country&#39;s assets held in the US. In 2004, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/bushs-lifting-of-sanctions-against.php">lifted decades-old sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Libya after it agreed to dismantle its weapons programs and to acknowledge its history of state-sanctioned terror, including an agreement to <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2003/23325.htm">accept responsibility</a> [US DOS press release] for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6236538.stm">1988 bombing of Pam Am flight 103</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pan+Am+Flight+103">news archive</a>] and to compensate the victims&#39; families.

The <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/impiego_forze_armate/Art7bis.pdf">plan</a> [Art. 7a DL 92/08 text, PDF, in Italian] is part of a larger <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/pacchetto_sicurezza/testo_coordinato.pdf">package</a> [text, PDF, in Italian; <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/pacchetto_sicurezza/index.html">press release</a>, in Italian] approved by the Italian Senate last year, meant to reduce petty crime and Mafia activity and to slow illegal immigration. The relevant provision states: <blockquote>A plan for use of a contingent of military personnel belonging to the armed forces, preferably carabinieri used in military or volunteers of the same Armed Forces specifically trained for the tasks to be performed, may be authorized to increase control of the territory, where appropriate, for specific and unique demands of crime prevention. This staff is available to the prefects of the provinces, including metropolitan areas and densely populated areas, under Article 13 of Law 1 April 1981, n. 121, security guards at sensitive sites and targets, as well as general patrol and patrol jointly with police forces. The plan may be authorized for a period of six months, renewable once, for a quota of no more than 3,000 units.</blockquote> Of the 3,000 troops, 1,000 will be stationed at <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/impiego_forze_armate/vigilanza_congiunta_immigrati.pdf">immigration centers</a>, 1,000 will protect <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/impiego_forze_armate/vigilanza_congiunta_capoluoghi.pdf">sensitive sites and targets</a> in Rome, Milan and Naples, and the remaining 1,000 will perform <a href="http://www.governo.it/GovernoInforma/Dossier/impiego_forze_armate/piano_ripartizione_forze_armate.pdf">general patrols</a> [troop assignments, PDF, in Italian]. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gU9n4TYN4fvtzT2fPx78H8RsZB-A">more</a>. ANSA has <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2008-08-04_104248053.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Italy has recently been criticized for its anti-crime measures aimed specifically at the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roma">Roma minority</a> [JURIST news archive]. In late July, the Interior Ministry <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-to-scale-back-roma-fingerprinting.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the government would rework plans to fingerprint the Roma, altering requirements to only include those who do not have valid identification cards.  The decision was seen as a concession to intense <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/italy-plan-to-fingerprint-roma.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] of the fingerprinting plan by the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1315385&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">international human rights community</a> [COE statement] and <a href="http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=2958">Roma advocates</a> [ERRC materials]. In early July, the Italian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/italy-begins-mass-fingerprinting-of.php">began carrying out the plan</a> [JURIST report] to record the fingerprints of thousands of Roma, including children, ostensibly to reduce street crime and begging.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/08/081160P.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that federal courts must rule on an international petition for child repatriation unless a state court has already fully considered and ruled on the petition.  The ruling came in a case involving a father&#39;s petition under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_121.html">International Child Abduction Remedies Act</a> (ICARA) [text] seeking to have his children moved from Missouri, where they live with their mother, to Israel to live with him.  A federal district court had refused to rule on the petition, reasoning that the issue had already been raised in state court custody proceedings.  Reversing the lower court&#39;s decision and remanding for consideration of the petition, the circuit court held that courts must rule on the petitions in all but the narrowest cases:<blockquote>Because neither parent filed a [ICARA] petition in state court, we conclude that the [ICARA] issues were not properly or fully raised in that proceeding.  The parties did not litigate the merits of such issues, and any statement by the state court touching on an issue under the [ICARA] inquiry is not controlling.  It is &quot;the petitioner [who] is free to choose between state or federal court,&quot; and in the absence of a Hague petition the state court proceeding did not present an adequate opportunity to litigate ICARA issues.  It was therefore an abuse of discretion for the district court to abstain.</blockquote>The ICARA enforces the US&#39;s participation in the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text; official <a href="http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=text.display&tid=21">materials</a>], which was signed by the US in 1980.  The Convention is specifically designed to provide for the repatriation of children who have been removed from their country of &quot;habitual residence&quot; by one parent without the consent of the other, and petitions brought under the Convention can only be filed in <a href="http://hcch.e-vision.nl/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=24">participating countries</a> [signatory list].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/">Florida House of Representatives</a> [official website] Speaker <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/SEctions/Representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4180&SessionId=42">Marco Rubio</a> [official website] announced on Monday that the House will join the state of Florida in defending a challenge to a <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=38140&">law</a> [CS/CS/SB 1310 materials] requiring travel agencies booking flights to Cuba to post a bond ten times greater than that of other agencies.  Proponents of the law state that it is in keeping with the longstanding <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/legal/statutes/cda.pdf">US embargo on Cuba</a> [PDF, Cuban Democracy Act].  Florida&#39;s governor approved the law in June, but in July a federal judge <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/06/30/national/a112116D29.DTL">temporarily enjoined enforcement</a> [AP report] of the law until the court can rule on its constitutionality in September.  The plaintiffs, a group of 16 travel agents selling trips to Cuba, allege that Florida&#39;s actions are pre-empted by federal law, and that the state is improperly attempting to engage in foreign policy. CBS4 has <a href="http://cbs4.com/local/florida.house.state.2.787090.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 2004, the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040226-11.html">tightened travel restrictions</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/02/cuba-travel-restrictions-tightened.htm">report</a>] on travelers to Cuba. Invoking Cuba&#39;s status as what it called a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism&quot; and its past use of force against Americans and its own citizens, the administration authorized the US Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to prevent the departure of ships headed for Cuba, and to stop, inspect and even seize US ships en route to the island.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072220p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that a former <a href="http://www.temple.edu/">Temple University</a> [official website] sexual harassment policy was unconstitutionally broad and violated the freedom of expression of graduate student <a href="http://www.telladf.org/UserDocs/DeJohnTempleFactSheet.pdf">Christian DeJohn</a> [case fact sheet, PDF]. DeJohn submitted his <a href="http://www.telladf.org/UserDocs/DejohnvTempleUniversitycomplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] against the university in February 2006, alleging that the school&#39;s policy had prevented him from expressing his views against women in combat. He charged that the policy was &quot;vague, overbroad, and suppresse[d] the discussion of controversial viewpoints&quot; and sought an injunction against its use or enforcement. &nbsp;Upholding a lower court&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/UserDocs/DeJohnvTempleOrder.pdf">ruling</a>&nbsp;[opinion, PDF] that even though&nbsp;Temple had sufficiently narrowed its policy, it was facially unconstitutional, the court wrote: <blockquote>Under the Temple Policy the following elements, if present, constitute sexual harassment: (1) expressive, visual or physical conduct (2) of a sexual or gender-motivated nature and which (3) has the purpose or effect of either (3a) unreasonably interfering with an individual&#8217;s work, educational performance, or status, or (3b) creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment...<br /><br />...The policy&#8217;s use of &quot;hostile,&quot; &quot;offensive,&quot; and &quot;gender-motivated&#39; is, on its face, sufficiently broad and subjective that they &quot;could conceivably be applied to cover any speech&quot; of a &quot;gender-motivated&quot; nature &quot;the content of which offends someone.&quot; This could include &quot;core&quot; political and religious speech, such as gender politics and sexual morality. Absent any requirement akin to a showing of severity or pervasiveness&#8212;that is, a requirement that the conduct objectively and subjectively creates a hostile environment or substantially interferes with an individual&#8217;s work&#8212;the policy provides no shelter for core protected speech. [Citations omitted]</blockquote>The court also found that the school&#39;s continued defense of its old policy and the timing of the enactment of its <a href="http://policies.temple.edu/getdoc.asp?policy_no=04.82.01">new policy</a> [text, PDF] suggested that without an injunction, the school might reimplement the older rule. DeJohn had also initially accused the school and its professors of breach of contract, conspiracy and violations of Pennsylvania code with respect to his Master&#39;s degree work, but the District Court <a href="http://www.telladf.org/UserDocs/DeJohnvTempleOpinion.pdf">dismissed those claims</a> [opinion, PDF] in 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>] was sentenced Thursday to <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlkUMaokG6I7flYKGhlBfsW9qP9wD92DLBSG1">five and a half years in prison</a> [AP report] following his <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday of providing <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/May2007/Hamdan_Charges.pdf">material support for terrorism</a> [charge sheet, PDF] through his association with Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders. Hamdan had pleaded for leniency after apologizing for the deaths caused by his counterparts, and was given credit for the five years he has been detained since charges were first brought against him, meaning he could be released in as few as six months. The verdict was the first rendered by a military commission trial at Guantanamo Bay. On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36252prs20080806.html">criticized the conviction</a> [press release], saying it &quot;represent[ed] nothing more than an illusion of justice&quot; and called for an end to the commission system. Prosecutors in the case had sought a sentence of at least 30 years. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hlkUMaokG6I7flYKGhlBfsW9qP9wD92DJLVO0">more</a>.<br /><br />Hamdan has been in US custody since 2001, when he was captured in Afghanistan and accused of working as Osama Bin Laden&#39;s driver. In 2006 he successfully challenged US President George W. Bush&#39;s military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. In April, Hamdan announced that he <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hamdan-plans-boycott-of-guantanamo.php">planned to boycott his military commission trial</a>, and in May a military judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-judge-postpones-hamdan.php">delayed the trial</a> [JURIST reports] until July. A judge in the US District Court for the District of Columbia subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-delay-hamdan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by Hamdan&#39;s lawyers to stay his trial, ruling that a civilian court should refrain from reviewing the case until the military commission issues a final judgment. In July, the military court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-navy-judge-denies-hamdan-motion-to.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Hamdan&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges against him, holding that the military commission assigned to his trial had jurisdiction to hear the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.tsj.gov.ve/">Venezuelan Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] Tuesday <a href="http://www.tsj.gov.ve/informacion/notasdeprensa/notasdeprensa.asp?codigo=6299">upheld</a> [press release, in Spanish] a list blocking 272 political candidates from running for office because of suspected corruption.  Critics had argued that the <a href="http://www.vicuk.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=306&Itemid=30">list</a>  [Venezuela Information Centre analysis] was unconstitutional because many of those included had not been convicted of any crime. Some also alleged that the list focused on opponents of current <a href="http://www.gobiernoenlinea.gob.ve/venezuela/ejecutivo.html">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez</a> [official profile, in Spanish; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">profile</a>], but the court held: <blockquote>[T]he court concludes that the restriction of human rights is acceptable in accordance with the laws that are given for reasons of general interest, for the safety of other members of society and for the common good, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 30 and 32.2 of the American Convention on Human Rights.<br /><br />This requirement is fully compatible with the provisions of Articles 19 and 156, 32 cardinal of the National Constitution.</blockquote> The list was first compiled in February by Comptroller General Clodosbaldo Russian, who said that creating such a list was within his <a href="http://www.mintra.gov.ve/legal/leyesorganicas/lcontraloria.html">authority as comptroller</a> [Organic Law of the Comptroller General Office, in Spanish].  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080806/D92CGNPG2.html">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7544680.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Opponents have accused Chavez of pushing increasingly autocratic reforms, including <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-opposition-criticizes.php">constitutional changes</a> [JURIST report] that would eliminate presidential term limits and augment the president&#39;s emergency powers. Last year, the Venezuelan National Assembly <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gov.ve/publico/noticias/det_noticias.php?co=705">approved</a> [press release, in Spanish] a set of proposed amendments to the country&#39;s constitution by a 160-7 vote. The proposed amendments <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-congress-backs-chavez.php">passed a preliminary vote</a> [JURIST report] in the Assembly in August, and all of the constitutional reforms were subject to a two-part national referendum on December 2.  Chavez said the constitutional changes were necessary to advance Venezuela&#39;s socialist revolution, but Human Rights Watch warned that they would <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/10/16/venezu17104.htm">violate international law</a> [press release] by allowing the president to suspend due process guarantees during times of emergency.  In December, election observers reported <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/low-voter-turnout-in-venezuelan.php">low voter turnout for the referendum</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073271p.pdf">ruled</a>&nbsp;[decision, PDF] Thursday that in a mixed-motive employment discrimination case, the plaintiff must show he or she objectively met minimum requirements for the job.  The issue had not been addressed by other circuits, and came before the court in a lawsuit by former <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] employee Wagih Makky, who alleged that he had been inappropriately placed on unpaid administrative leave because of his status as an Egyptian Muslim, in violation of <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> [statute text].  Makky had designed security protocols for TSA but was placed on unpaid administrative leave in 2005 after an administrative board had denied his renewal request for top secret <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/l/blsecmenu.htm">security clearance</a> [DSS backgrounder], a prerequisite for his position. The court held that because he lacked this necessary qualification, it could not address whether or not there was another, discriminatory reason for his dismissal: <blockquote>Makky does not dispute that his position required him to have access to National Security Information.  The lack of a security clearance in a position such as Makky&#8217;s is akin to the lack of a license in a position such as a medical doctor because without a security clearance Makky&#8217;s subjective qualifications are irrelevant.   A security clearance is the minimum requirement needed to hold Makky&#8217;s position.  Thus, as of January 2005, when Makky&#8217;s clearance was suspended, he was not qualified on the most basic level to perform his job.</blockquote>The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to review the underlying denial of his clearance, and that he now lacked the adequate clearance to obtain confidential documents relating to the administrative board&#39;s decision.<br /><br />The TSA board had said that one of the reasons for the denial of Makky&#39;s clearance renewal was his association with suspicious persons, even though he said he had declared no new acquaintances in Egypt since he was originally granted the clearance.  TSA has been <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/customer/redress/index.shtm">criticized</a> [TSA redress site] for the criteria used to determine who is associated with suspicious activity, and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/35968prs20080714.html">reported</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-terrorist-watchlist-needs-tighter.php">report</a>] in July that the country&#39;s terrorism watch list includes more than one million names, which government officials say <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/15/aclu-errs-in-list-of-names/">represent approximately 400,000 people</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Washington Times</font> report] because of the inclusion of aliases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/07-2626-01A.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion text] the dismissal of a shareholder securities suit against <a href="http://www.biogenidec.com/">Biogen Idec</a> [corporate website], in which the class of plaintiffs accused directors of violating the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/34act/index1934.shtml">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text] by intentionally misrepresenting the safety of its multiple-sclerosis drug, <a href="http://www.tysabri.com/tysbProject/tysb.portal">Tysabri</a> [informational website], in order to sell their shares at high prices, resulting in proceeds in excess of $84 million.  In affirming the district court&#39;s ruling that the plaintiffs did not plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter in accordance with the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ67.104.pdf">Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995</a> [text] the Court of Appeals held:<blockquote>Here, we have already discounted the inferences of scienter from claims about failure to disclose the risk of non-PML opportunistic infections and of safety concerns with combination therapy. Even if defendants&#39; statements were arguably misleading, plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that the statements were intentionally so; that is, that defendants had any reason to know their statements were misleading before February 18, 2005, the day of the meeting where the defendants first learned of the PML diagnoses. Thus, any insider trading which occurred during the class period until February 18, 2005 cannot be used to support a strong inference of scienter, since &quot;[i]nsider trading cannot establish scienter on its own.&quot; [citations omitted]</blockquote>Tysabri was approved by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] in November 2004, and share prices increased immediately.  Within months, two patients developed infections from ongoing clinical trials, and one died.  Biogen <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=abwfct4CDA4Y&refer=us">took the drug off the market</a> [Bloomberg report; Biogen <a href="http://www.biogenidec.com/news/BiogenIDECPR_069.htm">press release</a>] in February 2005, and the share price fell 42.5% amid heavy trading.<br /><br />Last month, the <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.shtml">US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce</a> [official website] began an <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110-ltr.072208.FDA.Ranbaxy.pdf">investigation</a> [information request, PDF; <a href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110nr323.shtml">press release</a>] into whether the FDA had allowed the sale of drugs that agency officials knew had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/house-committee-begins-investigation-of.php">manufactured and sold using faulty data</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Ameziane%20-%20Public%20Profile%20FINAL%20(08%2005%2008).doc">Djamel Ameziane</a> [advocacy profile, DOC] Wednesday <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/IACHR%20Petition%20&%20Request%20for%20PMs_Ameziane%20v.%20United%20States_8-6-08.doc">filed a complaint</a> [DOC text; <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/guantanamo-detainee-files-first-petition-against-u.s.-inter-american-commiss">press release</a>] against the US with the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/English/Basic17.Statute%20of%20the%20Commission.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [governing statute; <a href="http://www.cidh.org/DefaultE.htm">official website</a>], alleging that he had been tortured, given inadequate medical treatment, and denied other basic rights. The complaint was filed on Ameziane&#39;s behalf by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.cejil.org/comunicados.cfm?y=2008">Center for Justice and International Law</a> [advocacy websites], and was the first to be brought by a detainee.  The groups contend that Ameziane&#39;s treatment violates conditions of the <a href="http://www.hrcr.org/docs/OAS_Declaration/oasrights.html">American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man</a> [materials] and that Ameziane has been denied timely review of his <font style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</font> petition by the US, despite the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-1195.ZO.html">ruling</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] in <u>Boumediene v. Bush</u>, where it held that detainees have the right to bring such petitions. The advocacy groups stated:<blockquote>Djamel Ameziane is a prisoner at the U.S. Naval Base at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, where he has been held virtually incommunicado, without charge or judicial review of his detention, for six and a half years.  While arbitrarily and indefinitely detained by the United States at Guant&aacute;namo, Mr. Ameziane has been physically and psychologically tortured, denied medical care for health conditions resulting from his confinement, prevented from practicing his religion without interference and insult, and deprived of developing his private and family life.  The stigma of Guant&aacute;namo will continue to impact his life long after he is released from the prison.  These harms, as well as the denial of any effective legal recourse to seek accountability and reparations for the violations he has suffered, constitute violations of fundamental rights under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (&#8220;American Declaration&#8221;).  The U.S. government, as a signatory to the Declaration, is obliged to respect these rights vis-&agrave;-vis Mr. Ameziane by virtue of holding him as its prisoner.</blockquote>The groups asked the IACHR to issue &quot;precautionary measures&quot; to prevent the US from committing further alleged abuses against Ameziane, to consider his release in a timely manner, and to ensure that he is not returned to a country where he could face abuse once he is released. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hLezEymA21gxqoz4BrUoQBhDp4jw">more</a>.<br /><br />In June, a special investigator for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oscepa.org/">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Parliamentary Assembly</a>&nbsp;(OSCEPA) [official website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oscepa.org/oscepa_content/documents/astana/Guantanamo%20Report%20English.pdf">joined</a>&nbsp;[OSCEPA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-should-expedite-guantanamo-closure.php">report</a>] numerous&nbsp;international groups and rights activists in&nbsp;<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+closure">calling for the closure of the Guantanamo detention center</a> [JURIST news archive]. In February, the leaders of 34 international bar associations and law societies sent a <a href="http://www.cba.org/CBA/submissions/pdf/08-15-eng.pdf">letter</a> [PDF text] to US President George W. Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/international-bar-associations-call-for.php">urging the &quot;immediate closure&quot; of the facility</a> [JURIST report]. Last October, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism Martin Scheinin called on the US to<a href="/paperchase/2007/10/un-rights-expert-urges-us-to-prosecute.php"> quickly prosecute or release terror suspects</a> [JURIST report] detained at Guantanamo Bay so that the US can close the detention center. In May, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/guantanamo-closure-blocked-by-legal.php">reiterated</a> President Bush&#39;s August 2007 claim that the US <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/six-more-detainees-transferred-from.php">wants to close the base</a> [JURIST reports], but that both legal and logistical impediments make the closure difficult.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] War crimes suspect and former fugitive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=4079894&postID=6225787947966273028" edu="" q="Karadzic">news archive</a>] has submitted a <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/submisions/080805.pdf">document</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official site] asserting that he was granted an immunity deal by former US Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS biography], conditioned on his removing himself from public life. The ICTY made the document available Thursday, and in it Karadzic wrote that he had not been allowed to fully explain himself in court Wednesday. He claimed that: <blockquote>Mr Holbrooke undertook on behalf of the USA that I would not be tried before this Tribunal and that I should understand that for a while there would be very sharp rhetoric against me so that my followers would not hamper the implementation of the Dayton agreement.  The USA kept its promise to ease the pressure on the SDS and Mr Holbrooke himself boasted in the press that he had persuaded me to withdraw not only from public but also from party offices.  There is evidence of this in the media, which contain proof that there was an agreement. [sic]</blockquote> He went on to ask the Tribunal to order the appearance of not only Holbrooke, but also former US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/40381.htm">Madeleine Albright</a> [DOS profile] and two other officials allegedly involved in the deal.  Holbrooke and Albright have denied the accusations, but Purdue University Professor <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/history/facstaff/Ingrao/H-Ingrao.htm">Charles Ingrao</a> [faculty profile], leader of a <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/history/facstaff/Ingrao/si/scholars.htm">research group</a> [Scholars&#39; Initiative website] dealing with issues of the former Yugoslavia, <a href="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2458">said in an interview</a> [Bosnian Institute report] that he has independent evidence verifying Karadzic&#39;s claims. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j3_Nsd-oWuuKZd4NZr7vwBL4Bxbg">more</a>.<br /><br />Western media has sharply criticized both Thursday&#39;s submission and last week&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/karadzic/presskit/files/ps-080731.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-claims-icty-trial.php">report</a>] in which Karadzic argued to the Tribunal that it is impossible for him to receive a fair trial. Southeastern European media sources, however, have often been more receptive to Karadzic&#39;s argument. Karadzic has vowed to <a href="/forumy/2008/07/karadzics-choice-why-war-criminals.php">represent himself</a> [JURIST Forum] in defending against charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, largely related to his alleged oversight of the  <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats during the 1990s.  He faces life in prison if convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former <a href="http://www.enron.com/">Enron</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">news archive</a>] executives convicted on charges related to the 2001 accounting scandal may be eligible for new trials, depending on the outcome of an <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/enron-ex-ceo-skilling-appeals.php">appeal</a>  [JURIST report] by former Enron CEO <a href="http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/special/01/enron/skilling/skilling.html">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> profile].  Skilling was convicted under a theory of &quot;deprivation of honest services,&quot; which allows for the prosecution of people who enabled fraud but did not personally benefit from it. Experts say his appeal has a good chance of success after the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] that theory in a 2006 case involving four former Merrill Lynch executives.  If successful, other Enron executives may also challenge their convictions under the theory.  McClatchy has <a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/national_news/story/814397.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In September 2007, Skilling appealed his <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-jury-finds-lay-skilling.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report; verdict <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/3884057.html">backgrounder</a>]  on 19 counts of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud, claiming errors by prosecutors and the trial judge. In April 2007, former Enron Vice President <a href="http://www.chron.com/content/news/photos/02/10/21/players/photo10.6.1.html">Christopher Calger</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> profile], who was also charged under the &quot;honest services&quot; theory, <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/former-enron-executive-withdraws-guilty.php">withdrew a guilty plea</a> to a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud after the 2006 Merrill Lynch verdict was overturned.  In the Merrill Lynch case, the convictions of the executives were overturned when the court found that they had acted for the benefit of Enron and not to benefit themselves personally.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s coalition government said Thursday that it would push to impeach current <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>], a move that would require the endorsement of two-thirds of legislators in a joint session of parliament. Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) head <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile] said Thursday that Musharraf had given a &quot;clear commitment&quot; to step down from office after his party was defeated in <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-pakistan-parliament-could-reinstate.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST report], but subsequently refused to resign or go into exile. He also accused Musharraf of not following through on a promise to ask parliament for a confidence vote. PPP and coalition partner Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) officials have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/porposed-pakistan-constitutional.php">disagreed</a> [JURIST report] on how to limit or amend Musharraf&#39;s powers, with the PML-N generally favoring resignation or impeachment and the PPP favoring working with Musharraf to improve the country&#39;s political system. However, after Musharraf <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/08/top1.htm">declared</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] in June that he would neither step down nor go into exile, PPP leaders took a tougher stance, stating that Musharraf was only president by default and warning that if he did not step down, the parliament would <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15195">impeach him</a> [<em>The News</em> report].  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iWe152N60O8rfHfthVTBaXBeBs3wD92DHJNG0">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7546628.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June, the PML-N <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Pennsylvania judge has <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/files/reed_smith_order.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] to allow Christian foster parent organization <a href="http://www.bair.org/">Bair Foundation</a> [advocacy website] to proceed with its <a href="http://amlawdaily.typepad.com/amlawdaily/files/ReedSmithComplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the well-known law firm <a href="http://www.reedsmith.com/">Reed Smith</a> [firm website], rejecting four preliminary challenges by Reed Smith.  The lawsuit alleges that Reed Smith overcharged Bair for representation in an employment discrimination lawsuit, billing Bair almost one million dollars despite originally telling the group that legal fees would only run $50,000.  Bair asserted that the large firm model, which focuses on billable hours and pulling in large profits, is inappropriate for dealing with smaller nonprofit clients:<blockquote>In implementing its ambitious strategy of capturing global clients, which Reed Smith boasts results in &quot;a constant increase in revenue per partner,&quot; it has acknowledged that comparatively small regional or local law firms can or perhaps should service smaller clients. This is so because such firms typically charge much lower fees than &quot;white shoe&quot; international law firms like Reed Smith and are therefore more affordable to these smaller clients.<br /><br />However, Reed Smith has inexplicably continued to represent certain much smaller clients which lack substantial financial resources, such as Bair, a not-for-profit charitable foundation.</blockquote> Bair sued for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, legal negligence, and unjust enrichment. The judge dismissed the unjust enrichment claim.  The <em>Legal Intelligencer</em> has <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202423592057">more</a>.  <br /><br />Reed Smith has touted its <a href="http://www.reedsmith.com/special_topic.cfm?cit_id=7978">pro bono</a> [Reed Smith backgrounder] work, but some argue that such large firms are ill-equipped to effectively serve clients that don&#39;t fit the firm&#39;s &quot;global&quot; target size.  The case has sparked a great deal of <a href="http://blog.bluestonelawfirm.com/articles-big-law-gets-religion.html">commentary</a> [New York Malpractice Blog report] among legal bloggers debating the ethical duties of law firms in dealing with nonprofit and smaller clients.  Many legal professionals <a href="http://ohioemploymentlaw.blogspot.com/2007/12/should-companies-move-their-employment.html">believe</a> [Ohio Employer&#39;s Law Blog post] that smaller clients might be better served by smaller firms.  When Bair first filed the lawsuit last year, one critic <a href="http://legalblogwatch.typepad.com/legal_blog_watch/2007/12/should-biglaw-b.html">speculated</a> [Legal Blog Watch post] that &quot;Reed Smith owed a fiduciary duty to its client to explain its fee structure, and to explore whether that fee structure was suitable for a smaller client.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.house.gov/berman/index.shtml">Howard Berman</a> (D-CA), Chairman of the US House of Representatives <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [official websites], released a letter obtained by JURIST on Thursday in which he urged the Bush administration to postpone an international nuclear trade deal with India until the country is required to provide permanent security to nuclear facilities and stop nuclear weapons testing.  Berman said that without the requirements, the agreement would violate a <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5682">2006 US law</a> [HR 5862 materials] and give other NSG countries an advantage in trade with India, and urged the administration to push for a deal consistent with a <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-hr711/text">resolution</a> [HR 711] he introduced in 2007. The deal under consideration by the <a href="http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/">Nuclear Suppliers Group</a> (NSG) [official website] would provide an exception to <a href="http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/PDF/infcirc254r8p1-060320.pdf">International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) rules</a> [PDF, text] to allow NSG member states to trade nuclear materials with India, despite the fact that it is not a signatory of the Nuclear&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc140.pdf">Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>&nbsp;(NPT) [PDF, text].  In the letter, addressed to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Berman wrote:<blockquote>I am a friend of India and a supporter of U.S.-India nuclear cooperation.  Yet I find it incomprehensible that the Administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) guidelines for India with few or none of the conditions contained in the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006.  Such an exemption would be inconsistent with U.S. law, place American firms at a severe competitive disadvantage, and undermine critical U.S. nonproliferation objectives.  It would also jeopardize congressional support for nuclear cooperation with India, this year and in the future.<br /><br />Last year I introduced H. Res 711, a resolution that expresses the sense of the House that the President should withhold support from any proposed exemption for India in the NSG guidelines that is not fully consistent with the Hyde Act and that does not incorporate a number of key provisions, including: the immediate termination of all nuclear commerce by NSG member states if India detonates a nuclear explosive device or if the IAEA determines that India has violated its safeguards commitments; a requirement that the safeguards agreement concluded between India and the IAEA provides for safeguards in perpetuity for all nuclear facilities, materials, equipment and technology designated as &#8220;civil&#8221;, in accordance with IAEA standards, principles and practices; a prohibition on the transfer of enrichment, reprocessing and heavy water production technology by any NSG member state to India; and a stipulation that NSG supplier states may not grant India consent to reprocess nuclear fuel except in a facility that is under permanent and unconditional safeguards.</blockquote>Berman also wrote that in order for the agreement to be fully considered by Congress, a final deal should be delayed until after the November elections. Reuters has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080806/pl_nm/nuclear_india_usa_dc">more</a>. From India, PTI has <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/80D7F8A335DB05636525749E00228D7E?OpenDocument">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The US and other nuclear powers have become increasingly accepting of India&#39;s nuclear program, but in May they cited Iran&#39;s program as a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nuclear-powers-say-iran-threatening.php">major threat to the goals of the NPT</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in a <a href="http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/delegates%20statements/P5%20Statement.pdf">joint statement</a> [PDF text] issued at the end of a <a href="http://www.un.org/NPT2010/SecondSession/index.html">two-week meeting</a> [official website] of 106 NPT member nations. The countries urged Iran, currently under <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/security-council-broadens-iran-nuclear.php">UN sanctions</a> for its nuclear program, to <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-rejects-un-call-to-cease-nuclear.php">accept an incentive package</a> [JURIST reports] in exchange for abandoning uranium enrichment. That statement also addressed the nuclear situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=north+korea+nuclear">North Korea</a> [JURIST news archive], which opted out of the treaty in 2003 to restart disarmament negotiations.&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] on Thursday pleaded not guilty to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy charges</a> [JURIST report] based on allegations by a former aide.  The presiding judge ordered Anwar released on bail, ruling that he was not a flight risk.  Anwar has denied the accusations, saying that they are part of a government campaign to  to upset his plans to run in an August 26 by-election, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent.  Human rights groups have also questioned the timing of the charges.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/doc/?t=asia">Human Rights Watch Asia</a> [advocacy website] Thursday <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/07/malays19554.htm">called for the government to drop the charges</a> [press release], while <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] described the allegations as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/malaysia-charges-against-anwar-politically-motivated-20080806">&quot;politically motivated&quot;</a> [press release].  AFP has <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20080807-malaysian-opposition-leader-anwar-charged-with-sodomy-1">more</a>.  The <em>Financial Times</em> has <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d8e48e70-6441-11dd-af61-0000779fd18c.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Malaysian authorities briefly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> Anwar last month, less than a day after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-authorities-issue-arrest.php">warrant was issued for his arrest</a> [JURIST reports].  Last week, Anwar released a <a href="http://www.m2day.org/fpdf/rep.pdf">medical report</a> [PDF text and explanation; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-releases.php">report</a>] that he said refuted the sodomy allegations.  Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the expiration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Last month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]&nbsp;on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/45969B75D867657C8825749D004F199D/$file/0770293.pdf?openelement">ordered</a>&nbsp;[decision, PDF]&nbsp;a district court to accept guilty pleas entered by three illegal aliens facing immigration charges.  The defendants had entered unconditional guilty pleas to charges that they re-entered the country after having been removed previously, a violation of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/usc_sec_08_00001326----000-.html">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [statute provision].  The lower court had refused to accept the guilty pleas because it found they were not entered in accordance with &nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule11.htm">procedural&nbsp;rules</a>&nbsp;[FRCrP Rule 11(b) text] governing pleas, and a US Attorney charged the men with more serious violations of the INA punishable by longer prison terms. Holding that the pleas were not in violation of the rule and ordering their acceptance, the Ninth Circuit stated: <blockquote>The government lost its power to file additional charges the moment defendants pled guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and unconditionally before the magistrate judges.  Defendants&#39; pleas may not have taken final legal effect at that moment, as defendants remained free to withdraw their pleas...But whatever legal significance may attach to a guilty plea taken by a magistrate judge, the plea also carries significant real-world consequences.  A defendant&#39;s guilty plea is a confession, freely and publicly made, that he is a criminal.  This has immediate and enduring effects on the defendant&#39;s standing in the community, and for that reason and many others is often an excruciating experience. If the confession meets the requirements of Rule 11(b) - requirements that exist for the defendant&#39;s own protection - then the government has no power to force the defendant to go through the ordeal again to serve its own purposes. </blockquote>Last week, The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) obtained a government <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/36215res20080731.html">handbook</a> [PDF download; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/workplace/36219prs20080731.html">press release</a>] issued to the lawyers defending illegal immigrants <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=ice">arrested in May raids</a> [JURIST news archive] on a meat-processing plant in Iowa.  The ACLU then accused federal prosecutors of <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/doj-accused-of-pushing-guilty-pleas-on.php">pushing guilty pleas</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] on the immigrants.  The handbook included pre-printed forms to be used for filing guilty pleas, but had no information on contesting the charges. Representatives from both the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Rhodes080724.pdf">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Forman080724.pdf">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [testimony transcripts, PDF] have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/convictions-of-iowa-illegal-immigrants.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the government&#39;s arrest and conviction processes in those cases, saying that the immigrants&#39; constitutional rights were strictly applied.

The lower court had reasoned that because the&nbsp;government had failed to supply any new evidence of SIMI&#39;s involvement in illegal activity, the seven-year ban on the group should be lifted. The&nbsp;Indian government quickly appealed the ruling, claiming that lifting the ban would considerably harm the country&#39;s anti-terrorism efforts. The Supreme Court&#39;s ruling gives the&nbsp;government&nbsp;three weeks to present new evidence of SIMI&#39;s unlawfulness in order to make the ban permanent.  Reuters has <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-34860920080806">more</a>.<br /><br />The Indian government outlawed SIMI in 2001 pursuant to India&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=7&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmha.nic.in%2Fpdfs%2FUnlawful_Activities_Prevention_Act1967.pdf&ei=GjmaSNahKIGEvAX6oMw2&usg=AFQjCNEKFEPtZdwBiC0QhGnEEY32xY5Y0g&sig2=fZ25czamecbguUcoYJXY0w">Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967</a> [PDF text], alleging the group is tied to <a href="http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/terroristoutfits/simi.htm">several recent bombings</a> [SATP materials] in the country, but <a href="http://www.milligazette.com/dailyupdate/2006/20060806_simi_india_muslims_organisation.htm">advocates</a> [<em>Milli Gazette</em> op-ed] say charges against the group were brought for political reasons alone.&nbsp;Several countries including <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=muslim+brotherhood">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=eta">Spain</a> [JURIST news archives], and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-says-charity-front-for-tamil.php">Canada</a> [JURIST report] have banned Islamic groups or political parties for alleged ties to terrorist activities in recent years, while the UK has <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=pmoi">lifted some bans</a> [JURIST news archive] on groups no longer considered threats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/">Iraqi Parliament</a> [official website] has failed to agree on a draft election bill prior to adjourning for the summer on Wednesday.  Kurdish legislators have strongly opposed the bill&#39;s proposal to establish a provincial council in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/kirkuk.htm">Kirkuk</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] made up of equal numbers of Kurdish, Arab, and Turkmeni representatives.  Kurds constitute the majority in the area, and have argued that this arrangement does not reflect the region&#39;s true population.  Some have said that the delay in passing the draft law could postpone provincial elections until next year, although deputy parliamentary speaker Khalid al-Attiyah said that elections can proceed on schedule if the draft law is passed by September. Earlier this month, Iraqi law makers <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iraq-lawmakers-divide-control-of-kirkuk.php">reached an agreement to temporarily divide control of Kirkuk</a> [JURIST report] among the city&#39;s ethnic groups, as part of a compromise bill providing for provincial elections in the city.   AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080806/D92CSG2G1.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last month, Kurdish parliamentarians <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/kurdish-lawmakers-protest-draft.php">staged a walkout</a> [JURIST report], delaying a vote on the proposed provincial election bill that they said was unconstitutional.  The bill passed despite the boycott, but <a href="http://www.cabinet.iq/">Iraqi President Jalal Talabani</a> [official website, in Arabic; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2480197.stm">profile</a>] and the two other members of the Iraqi Presidency Council later <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iraq-president-rejects-draft-election.php">refused to sign it</a> [JURIST report] because it had been passed by an incomplete parliament. In February, Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-rejects-draft.php">rejected an earlier draft provincial elections law</a> [JURIST report] that detailed the relationship between Iraq&#39;s central and local governments, sending the legislation back to parliament. The draft law was part of a package of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-parliament-passes-key-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the parliament earlier that month that also included the 2008 budget and an <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/iraq-parliament-considers-detainee.php">amnesty bill</a> [JURIST report] that will lead to the release of roughly 5,000 prisoners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] ruled Tuesday that the law establishing the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/National%20Counter%20Corruption%20Commission">National Counter Corruption Commission</a> (NCCC) [official website] is appropriate under the country&#39;s current <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/english/files/2007-constitution-english%5B1%5D.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF text].  Ousted <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and his wife <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive] had filed a constitutional challenge to the NCCC statue, arguing that the law was an unreasonable violation of their rights to individual liberty.  Thaksin had also alleged that the body&#39;s authorizing statute violated Thailand&#39;s <a href="http://www.krisdika.go.th/lawHtmStaticContent01.jsp?frm=tmp&page=eng&lawType=law1&lawCode=%c306&lawID=%c306-10-2540-a0001">1997 constitution</a> and the <a href="http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/10/02/headlines/headlines_30015101.php">2006 interim charter</a> [texts], but the court declined to consider those arguments, finding the&nbsp;challenges&nbsp;moot because those charters are no longer in effect.  The <em>Bangkok Post</em> has <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/060808_News/06Aug2008_news05.php">more</a>.<br /><br />Thai prosecutors have brought multiple corruption charges against Thaksin and his wife since Thaksin&#39;s ouster in a September 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">bloodless coup</a> [JURIST report].  Last month, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed  charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin relating to a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies.  Thaksin has also been charged in relation to an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-high-court-takes-corruption.php">alleged corruption scheme</a> [JURIST report] concerning the country&#39;s lottery system.  Thaksin is currently the subject of 24 legal actions.  Also last month, a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-court-convicts-wife-of-ex-pm.php">convicted Pojamarn Shinawatra of tax evasion</a> [JURIST report] for transferring $16.3 million worth of stock to her step-brother and secretary, who were also convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran has commuted the sentences of four people scheduled to be executed by stoning and has suspended the use of the punishment, local media reported Wednesday. Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi, the head of the country&#39;s judiciary, had originally placed a moratorium on the punishment in 2002, but nine people were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm">given the sentence</a> [BBC report] in July for adultery and sexual offenses. International rights advocates have <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/campaigning-end-stoning-iran-20080115">increased pressure</a> [AI release] on Iran to ban the punishment, and the country announced an <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/iran-to-investigate-judge-who-ordered.php">investigation into the judge</a> [JURIST report] who ordered the stoning execution of a man convicted of adultery in July 2007.

Former Zvornik mayor Branko Grujic and former local defense chief Branko Popovic are accused of using their positions to detain and kill civilians.  In 2005, prosecutors <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html%5Ftrz/OPTUZNICE/OPT_ZVORNIK_ENG.mht">charged</a> [indictment, MHT; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4146594.stm">report</a>] Grujic, Popovic and five others with murdering at least 19 Bosnian Muslim civilians.  Theirs was the first war crimes case to be transfered from the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] to Serbian courts.

Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity for overseeing the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] prison massacre and other killings of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, while Hadzic faces crimes against humanity charges for killings of non-Serbs and for abuses in Croatian prison camps.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan Justice Minister Abdel-Basit Sabdarat said Wednesday that he had named one primary prosecutor and three assistants to investigate and try war crimes suspects from the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] in the Netherlands currently handles such proceedings, but if Sudanese domestic courts are created with appropriate human rights and accountability safeguards, the ICC is required to hand over jurisdiction under Article 16 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF text]. The announcement is seen largely as a reaction to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">controversial effort</a> [JURIST report] to seek an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/406.html">press release</a>] for Sudanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>]. Both the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> (LAS) and the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official websites] have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the warrant and underlying indictment, saying they threaten peace in the unstable country and that Sudan will <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">create its own internationally-monitored courts</a> [JURIST report]. The newly appointed prosecutor will report to the Justice Ministry every month, and if the prosecutor gathers enough evidence against a suspect, he may present the case to a state court. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gOROzxPT-YE8eQvXftB-b9k0uO2A">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sudan Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28166">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The LAS released its <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/arabic/news_details_ar.jsp?art_id=1226">proposal</a> [press release, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-plans-response-to-possible.php">report</a>] for creating the courts in July, following an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-seeks-arab-league-talks-over.php">emergency meeting</a> [JURIST report] to mediate the dispute over the ICC&#39;s warrant for al-Bashir. The AU also released a <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/ua/actualites/2008/juillet/psc/142-communique-eng.pdf">resolution</a> [PDF text] the same month, requesting that the ICC defer to Sudanese courts once they are legitimized.  The UN Security Council has repeatedly asked Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the investigation of al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office. Before al-Bashir&#39;s indictment the Sudanese government had already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.qwest.com/about/">Qwest Communications</a> [corporate website] will pay an additional $40 million to settle a class action shareholder lawsuit, according to an agreement released Monday in the company&#39;s <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/11/119535/2Q08EarningsRelease.pdf">second quarter earnings report</a> [press release; <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=119535&p=irol-reportsAnnual">materials</a>].  Of that number, $5 million comes from insurance revenue by former Qwest CEO <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nacchio">Joseph Nacchio</a> [JURIST news archive] and former CFO Robert Woodruff.  In 2006, a federal judge approved a <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20051101/ai_n15828672">$400 million settlement</a> [AP report] that did not include Nacchio or Woodruff, but the two former Qwest officials appealed, arguing that Qwest was required to indemnify them from future litigation.  A federal court must still approve the new settlement terms.  AP has <a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2008/08/11/92653.htm">more</a>.  <br /><br />Federal prosecutors indicted Nacchio in December 2005 on <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/former-qwest-ceo-charged-with-42.php">42 counts of insider trading</a> [JURIST report]. He and other former Qwest executives still face <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/corporations-and-securities-brief-sec_15.php">civil fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] brought by the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website] on allegations that Qwest improperly reported approximately $3 billion in revenue related to its 2000 merger with US West. Another former Qwest employee, ex-vice president Marc Weisberg, <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/former-qwest-vp-pleads-guilty-to-wire.php">pleaded guilty to wire fraud</a> [JURIST report] in December 2005 and helped prosecutors build their case against Nacchio.  <br />Last month, the <a href="http://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/downloads/eb-rhr-order-07-1311.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] prosecutors&#39; petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing on whether Nacchio&#39;s insider trading conviction should be overturned. In March, a Tenth Circuit panel <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/07/07-1311">struck down</a> [ruling, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-orders-new-trial.php">report</a>]  Nacchio&#39;s previous conviction and ordered a new trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Detained Myanmarian democracy activist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=aung+san+suu+kyi">news archive</a>] has met with a lawyer to discuss the legality of her detention, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy party said Sunday.  This was apparently the first time in five years that Suu Kyi has been allowed to consult with a legal representative.  In May, the ruling junta <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/myanmar-junta-to-detain-democracy.php">extended Suu Kyi&#39;s house arrest for another year</a> [JURIST report], a decision that has angered many international human rights organizations and activists. The extension is said to violate a Myanmarian law barring the government from detaining a person for over five years without trial, although a June editorial in state newspaper <a href="http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/index.html">New Light of Myanmar</a> [media website] said that the law authorized detentions for up to six years.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080810/D92FE3G00.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, has spent 11 of the past 17 years in prison or under house arrest for alleged violations of an <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/anti-subversion%20law.htm">anti-subversion law</a> [text].  Last year, the military government had <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/myanmar-says-suu-kyi-unlikely-to-be.php">implied that she might be released</a> [JURIST report] after the country&#39;s new constitution was approved.  In May, the junta announced that Myanmar&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar+constitution">draft constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/myanmar-constitution-approved-with-93.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] in a national referendum after two rounds of voting with 92 percent of votes cast favoring the proposed charter and 98 percent of the country&#39;s 27 million eligible voters turning out.

Morales himself <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">proposed the referendum</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] last December in response to accusations that his process for rewriting the Bolivian constitution has been illegitimate, and said Monday that he will use his demonstrated support to push for nationalization of major industries and concentration of power in the central government. Despite Morales&#39;s claim that the vote would <a href="javascript:popUp('prensa/Noticias.asp?id=200808101&p=5')">bring unity to the country</a> [press release, in Spanish], opponents of the changes have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7553227.stm">held protests</a> [BBC report] calling for more autonomy for provincial governments in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Thailand <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129527">issued arrest warrants</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report] on Monday for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and his wife <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive] after the two failed to return to Thailand from the UK on Sunday. Thaksin and Pojamarn had been released on bail, but recently sent a letter to the Thai government saying they <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129499">would not be returning from the UK</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</span> report] because they do not believe they could receive fair trials in the current judicial system. The Thai government is reportedly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aLW48ApiqMnc&refer=asia">seeking their extradition</a> [Bloomberg report] from the UK and will retain their nearly $400,000 in bail. Late last month, A Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-court-convicts-wife-of-ex-pm.php">convicted Pojmarn</a> [JURIST report] of tax evasion for transferring $16.3 million worth of stock to her step-brother and secretary, and the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-high-court-takes-corruption.php">brought additional corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin, alleging that he and 47 others were involved in misconduct related to the country&#39;s lottery system. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hANuuwVHmbntWKE0uaFZ8QOU-lfQ">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Sunday asked the Israeli government to <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/08/israb19576.htm">stop official plans</a> [letter text] to demolish or confiscate the homes of those suspected of terrorism, calling such plans a violation of international law. The request by HRW came after Israeli Defense Minister <a href="http://www.ehudbarak.org.il/">Ehud Barak</a> [official website, in Hebrew] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215331211445&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">ordered the demolition</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Jerusalem Post</span> report] of a home owned by the family of a suspected terrorist. HRW Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said of the demolition plans: <blockquote>Proposals to allow the Israel Defense Forces to resume the collective punishment of house demolitions would mark a substantial step backward in Israel&#8217;s respect for human rights &#8211; a return to illegality. ...Punishing people for the crimes of others is no solution to terrorism. Israel should focus on bringing to justice those who actually plan or carry out attacks.</blockquote>HRW officials wrote that the demolition policy violates both Article 17 of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cpr.html">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> and <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/380-600060?OpenDocument">Article 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention</a>, which prohibits all property destruction in occupied territories except as &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; for military reasons.  They also alleged violations of <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600038?OpenDocument">Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention</a> [texts] because the demolitions are collective punishments affecting people who are not suspected terrorists.<br /><br />In February 2005, then-Israeli Defense Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2381785.stm">Shaul Mofaz</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/israeli-defense-minister-halts.php">ordered a halt</a> [JURIST report] to the destruction of homes of suspected terrorists after a committee report showed that the policy was inflaming tensions with Palestinians. The policy was initiated in 2000 in an attempt to deter terrorists who did not want to leave their families homeless, or to encourage families to turn in those plotting attacks. Under the plan, about 670 homes were destroyed. Israeli and international human rights groups have objected to the policy, <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Punitive_Demolitions/Index.asp">condemning it</a> [B&#39;Tselem backgrounder] as a form of collective punishment affecting innocent individuals.

Following last month&#39;s discovery of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/KhadrDocuments.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] showing that the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/new-documents-show-canada-knew-of-khadr.php">knew Khadr had been mistreated</a> [JURIST report], Harper has come under heavy <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/canada-pm-criticized-for-not.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] for refusing to interfere with US proceedings against Khadr.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Members of the Muslim group <a href="http://hizbut-tahrir.or.id/">Hizbut Tahir Indonesia</a> (HTI) [group website, in Bahasa] held a demonstration outside the US Consulate General and the US embassy in Jakarta Sunday to protest a <a href="http://etan.org/etanpdf/2008/karma-pakageletter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent by members of US Congress asking for the release of two Papuan prisoners. In 2005, an Indonesian court sentenced <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/special-focus-cases/filep-karma-and-yusak-pakage/page.do?id=1101238&n1=3&n2=34&n3=53">Filep Karma and Yusak Pakage</a> [Amnesty International backgrounder], both members of the opposition group <a href="http://www.geocities.com/opm-irja/">Free Papua Organization</a> (OPM) [group website], to 10 and 15 years in prison respectively after finding them guilty of treason for raising a Papuan flag. In the letter, the members of Congress wrote: <blockquote>We urge you to take action to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Karma and Mr. Pakage. Any security officials who mistreated Mr. Karma or who may have employed inappropriate force against peaceful demonstrators should be prosecuted.  Such steps would be an important indicator that Indonesia, as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, takes its international obligations to fully respect universally recognized human rights.</blockquote> The protesters stressed that US officials should not interfere with the affairs of other sovereign nations and called on Indonesian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3725301.stm">Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono</a> [BBC profile] to reject the US request. Indonesian officials have <a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/8/10/fm-to-reply-to-us-congress-letter-soon/">said</a> [ANTARA report] that their official response will include the protesters&#39; request for US noninterference. ANTARA News has <a href="http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/8/10/thousands-hold-rally-outside-us-consulate-office-in-e-java/">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5itW6mz-KWaNW1EyAFpjv_PH56Osg">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In February 2007, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/papua0207/">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-group-censures-indonesia-for.php">report</a>] indicating that Indonesia had convicted and jailed at least 18 people for advocating a sovereign government for the province of Papua. Article 28 of <a href="http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/indonesia/ConstIndonesia.html">Indonesia&#39;s 1945 Constitution</a> [text] guarantees freedom of expression, but HRW wrote that subsequent legislation has denied Indonesians this right. In July 2007, the <a href="http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/mk_lkht/m/indexeng.html">Indonesian Constitutional Court</a> [official website] voided Articles 154 and 155 of the Indonesian criminal code prohibiting acts of inciting hatred against the government or the distribution of materials voicing opposition against the government, <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/indonesia-constitutional-court-nixes.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Dutch colonial-era articles violated the freedom of expression guaranteed in the country&#39;s constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN observed its fourteenth <a href="http://www.un.org/events/indigenous/2008/index.shtml">International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People</a> [official website] Saturday, marking the first observance since the September 2007 adoption of the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.un.org/events/indigenous/2008/pdfs/declaration.pdf">FAQ</a>, PDF]. In 1994, the General Assembly <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N95/767/05/PDF/N9576705.pdf?OpenElement">declared</a> [A/RES/49/214 text, PDF] that the day would be observed every August 9 in an effort to &quot;promote the enjoyment of the rights of indigenous people and the full development of their distinct cultures and communities.&quot; The Assembly <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/486/70/PDF/N0448670.pdf?OpenElement">reaffirmed that declaration</a> [A/RES/59/174 text, PDF; official <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/second.html">website</a>] in 2004. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/events/indigenous/2008/sgmessage.shtml">said</a> [statement] of the UN&#39;s continued observance of the day in 2008: <blockquote>The fundamental motivation was the Assembly&#8217;s recognition of the need to place the United Nations clearly and strongly behind the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, in order to put an end to their marginalization, their extreme poverty, the expropriation of their traditional lands and the other grave human rights abuses they have faced and continue to encounter. Indeed, the suffering of indigenous peoples includes some of the darkest episodes in human history.</blockquote> The UN&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/news_internationalday2008.html">official celebration</a> [program and materials] of the day included statements by UN officials, a cultural performance and a panel discussion on Conciliation and Reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and States. The UN News Centre has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27640&Cr=Indigenous&Cr1=">more</a>.<br /><br />The Declaration <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23794&Cr=indigenous&Cr1">adopted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/un-adopts-treaty-supporting-rights-of.php">report</a>] by the General Assembly in 2007 is a non-binding treaty outlining the global <a href="/currentawareness/humanrights.php">human rights</a> [JURIST news archive] of about 370 million indigenous people and banning discrimination against them. 143 member states voted to adopt the treaty and 11 abstained. Four member states - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States - voted against adopting the treaty, citing concerns that its text conflicted with their countries&#39; own laws, among other contentions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  International human rights groups on Saturday condemned any violence Russian or Georgian forces might commit against civilians in the separatist region of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3797729.stm#leaders">South Ossetia</a> [BBC backgrounder], warning that those actions may amount to war crimes.  After a period of smaller conflicts, on Friday the <a href="http://www.parliament.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=13">Republic of Georgia</a> [official backgrounder; JURIST news <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=georgian+republic">archive</a>] announced that to restore constitutional order, it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/world/europe/10georgia.html?ref=europe">launching a large scale military offensive</a> [NY Times report] in the region, which broke away from Georgia following a 1991-1992 war. On Saturday, Russia <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7548715.stm">sent troops</a> [BBC report] into South Ossetia in what it called a mission to protect civilians.  <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] Europe and Central Asia Director Holly Cartner <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/08/georgi19575.htm">stated</a> [press release]: <blockquote>All sides must remember that attacks on civilians, or acts intended to terrorize civilians, clearly violate international humanitarian law, and may constitute war crimes.  This would be true even if they are carried out in reprisal for indiscriminate attacks by the adversary.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?l=1">International Crisis Group</a> [official website] issued a similar <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5621&l=1&m=1">statement</a> [text], calling on both sides to end the conflict and uphold humanitarian law.  Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSL9294481">more</a>.<br /><br />After South Ossetia declared its independence from Georgia in 1991, violence in the region continued until the following year, when an agreement was reached to deploy peacekeepers from Georgia, Russia, and South Ossetia itself.  There was a lull in the conflict until <a href="http://www.president.gov.ge/?l=E&m=0&sm=0">Mikhail Saakashvili</a> [official website] became president of Georgia in 2004, and announced his intentions to bring breakaway regions back under Georgian control.  Analysts say the current fighting marks the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/georgia-human-rights-lawsuit-harming.php">continuing deterioration</a> [JURIST report] in Georgian-Russian relations.  Recent conflicts have included <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/georgian-republic-government-declares.php">accusations by Georgian authorities</a> [JURIST report]  that Russia instigated protests calling for an overthrow of the government last November, and allegations of Russia&#39;s role in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/georgian-republic-sentences-opposition.php">coup plot</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/07-7108-1132167.pdf">dismissed</a> [decision, PDF] a shareholder suit against government-sponsored lender <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/">Fannie Mae</a> [corporate website] for alleged wrongdoing by the board of directors. Shareholders accused the board of failing to take appropriate steps in 2004 to prevent accounting violations, and also asserted that the board should not have approved $31 million in severance benefits for two officers who resigned as a result of the violations. Upholding the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/federal-court-dismisses-fannie-mae.php">district court&#39;s decision</a> [JURIST report], the DC Circuit held that it had the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode12/usc_sec_12_00001723---a000-.html">authority</a> [US Code &sect; 1723] to hear claims against Fannie Mae, but that the appellants were not excused from <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23_1.htm">making demand on the board</a> [FRCP Rule 23.1 text] prior to filing suit.  Judge Kavanaugh commented, &quot;The story of Fannie Mae told by these reports is disturbing.&quot; Later in the opinion, he wrote:<blockquote>According to plaintiffs, the complaint alleges that the directors crossed that line by failing to adequately respond to several &#8220;red flags&#8221;: (1) a $200 million audit difference originating in 1998; (2) a whistleblower&#8217;s complaints that Fannie Mae was improperly manipulating earnings; (3) signs that Fannie Mae management was using improper hedge accounting practices; and (4) sister company Freddie Mac&#8217;s disclosure in 2003 that it had understated profits. We disagree that these allegations create a&#8220;substantial likelihood&#8221; of personal liability for the directors. On each claim, the Board or its relevant committee looked into the matter and relied on internal or external accounting experts and officials responsible for those matters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to high-level supporters on Friday, <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] has affirmed his <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/08/top1.htm">June vow</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] that he will neither step down nor go into exile, despite the recent pressure from opposition forces.  Secretary General of the <a href="http://www.pml.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Q</a> [party website] party Mushahid Hussain said that Musharraf will fight against impeachment, with plans to portray himself as an honest leader in comparison to Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) head <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile] and Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) head <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive], both of whom have faced corruption accusations in the past. On Thursday, Pakistan&#39;s coalition government said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">push to impeach Musharraf</a> [JURIST report], a move that would require the endorsement of two-thirds of legislators in a joint session of parliament.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/world/asia/09pstan.html?ref=asia">more</a>.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7441583.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />PPP and coalition partner PML-N officials have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/porposed-pakistan-constitutional.php">disagreed</a> [JURIST report] on how to limit or amend Musharraf&#39;s powers, with the PML-N generally favoring resignation or impeachment and the PPP favoring working with Musharraf to improve the country&#39;s political system. PPP leaders took a tougher stance in June, stating that Musharraf was only president by default and warning that if he did not step down, the parliament would <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15195">impeach him</a> [<em>The News</em> report].  The PML-N then <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An August 17 trial date has been set for five Sudanese men accused of killing John Granville, an aid worker affiliated with the <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) [official website], Sudan&#39;s state media reported Friday.  Following the January shooting of John Granville and his driver, a previously-unknown extremist group calling itself <a href="http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-01/2008-01-05-voa7.cfm?CFID=23131224&CFTOKEN=86514875">Ansar al-Tawhid</a> [VOA report] claimed responsibility for the shootings. Granville was the first US diplomat killed in Sudan since the deaths of <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/canoel.htm">US Ambassador Cleo Noel</a> and US Embassy staffer <a href="http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/gcmoore.htm">George Curtis Moore</a> [Arlington Cemetery memorials] in 1973.  Reuters has <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2008-08-08T161029Z_01_L896884_RTRUKOC_0_US-SUDAN-USA-MURDER.xml">more</a>.<br /><br />Granville&#39;s death has been cited as an example of the increasing dangers faced by US diplomats abroad.  In June, Zimbabwean police <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-police-detain-us-uk-diplomats.php">detained US and UK diplomatic envoys</a> [JURIST report] for several hours at a roadblock Thursday, threatening them and beating one of their drivers, in what US Ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee described as an &quot;illegal action.&quot; US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said that the Zimbabwean government&#39;s actions had <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/06/05/zimbabwe.violence/index.html#cnnSTCVideo">&quot;flouted all international convention&quot;</a> [press briefing, video]. Zimbabwean officials said that the detention was for the convoy members&#39; safety after they left a rally that had turned violent.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Judge James Robertson on Thursday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?1996cv1285-3573">ruled</a>  [opinion, PDF] in a <a href="http://www.indiantrust.com/">12-year class action lawsuit</a> [plaintiffs website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=indian+trust">news archive</a>] concerning the US government&#39;s alleged mismanagement of trust funds for a group of some 500,000 Native Americans.  Plaintiffs led by Eloise Cobell had argued that the federal government owed them $58 billion, representing its profits from land use violative of trust terms, but the government said that only $455.6 million was missing from the account.  Robertson accepted the government&#39;s number, finding that the method used to calculate the $58 billion figure was inaccurate and that there was  no evidence of active fraud by the <a href="http://www.interior.gov/">US Department of the Interior</a> [official website]:<blockquote>My conclusions, after attempting to apply a suitably adjusted set of equitable principles to the facts of this case, are that plaintiffs have properly asserted a claim for restitution; that this Court has both the jurisdiction and the power to adjudicate that claim; and that the evidence supports an award in the amount of $455,600,000, a number that is within the range of the government&#39;s own admitted &quot;uncertainty&quot; about the amount necessary to restore the proper balance to the IIM trust. I have rejected the plaintiffs&#39; claim of entitlement to an additional sum representing &quot;benefit to the government.&quot;</blockquote> Robertson said in April that he would <a href="http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.ViewDetail&PressRelease_id=188&Month=4&Year=2008">set a dollar figure</a> [plaintiffs press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-judge-promises-to-set-dollar.php">report</a>] on the US government&#39;s alleged mismanagement when the case <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/century-old-american-indian-trust-claim.php">went to trial in June</a> [JURIST report].  A judge will decide how to restore and distribute the missing money at a future hearing.  Reuters has <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2008-08-08T153636Z_01_N08320639_RTRUKOC_0_US-USA-INDIANS-LAWSUIT.xml">more</a>.  AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gROdMVQAH9z-mC2MwbMKM576BOVwD92DNHIO3">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Congress established the Indian trust in 1887 to hold proceeds from government-arranged leases of Indian lands.  In an <a href="http://www.indiantrust.com/_pdfs/20051020ITPI.pdf">incendiary opinion</a> [text] in 2005, District Court Judge Royce Lamberth required the Interior Department to <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/federal-judge-blasts-doi-orders.php">apologize to the plaintiffs</a> [JURIST report] for its handling of the trust, and to admit that information being provided to them regarding outstanding lost royalties on earnings from Indian land may be unreliable. In 2006, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/doj-lawyers-urge-federal-appeals-court.php">removed Lamberth</a> [JURIST report] and reassigned the case to Robertson.  In March 2007, the plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/indian-trust-plaintiffs-reject-7.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a $7 billion settlement proposal from the US government. In January, Robertson <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?1996cv1285-3505">ruled</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/us-interior-department-unreasonably.php">report</a>] that the DOI &quot;unreasonably delayed&quot; the accounting of billions of dollars of American Indian money, holding that it was impossible for the Interior Department or for Congress to remedy the breach.

In the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/aug/2008/Honeywell%20Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a>&nbsp;[PDF text], the state had alleged that the Honeywell had committed 38 infractions of <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ArizonaRevisedStatutes.asp?Title=49">state environmental laws</a> [statute materials], including the Arizona Water Quality Control Act, Arizona Hazardous Waste Disposal Act, and the Arizona Underground Storage Tank Act, over the past 30 years.  In the joint release from the Arizona <a href="http://www.azdeq.gov/index.html">Department of Environmental Quality</a> and <a href="http://www.azag.gov/">Attorney General</a> [official website], the state asserted that the company had improperly stored numerous hazardous materials and failed to report incidents of ground water contamination, but Honeywell maintains that it is not liable for the violations.

The DOJ also accused Honeywell of hiding knowledge that its patented <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT2001/5000/5930pereira.html">Zylon</a> [NASA backgrounder] fabric, which was used in the vests, would deteriorate over time, alleging that Honeywell pressured vests manufacturer <a href="http://www.armorholdings.com/">Armor Holdings</a> [corporate website] not to warn customers of this defect.   Honeywell denied the allegations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Indian Supreme Court judge on Friday withdrew from hearing a <a href="http://www.twocircles.net/2008jul14/apex_court_hold_open_court_hearing_judges_graft.html">judicial bribery case</a> [IANS report] after lawyers accused the court of protecting corrupt judges.  <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/sitting/bnagarwal.htm">Justice B.N. Agrawal</a> [official profile] said that he refused to consider unsubstantiated accusations against the court, adding that the behavior of the accusers, former <a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/sep/30josy.htm">Union Law Minister Shanti Bhushan</a> [Rediff interview] and his son <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/author.asp?name=Prashant+Bhushan">Prashant Bhushan</a> [<em>Outlook</em> archive], was &quot;contemptuous&quot; toward the court.  Two other high court justices declined to step down, and <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/judges/bio/sitting/bkgopinathan.htm">Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan</a> [official profile] will decide how the case will proceed without Agrawal.  The case at issue involves allegations that judges embezzled 70 million Rupees from the Ghaziabad district court treasury between 2001 and 2007.  Calcutta News has <a href="http://www.calcuttanews.net/story/391521">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/">Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] called for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-pm-backs-special-courts-for.php">establishment of special courts</a> [JURIST report] to deal specifically with corruption charges.  Balakrishnan later told reporters that Singh did not mean that the judiciary itself was corrupt, but rather that it has to deal with a large number of cases brought by the <a href="http://www.cbi.gov.in/default.php">Central Bureau of Investigation</a> [official website]. In response to questions about checks against possible judicial corruption, Balakrishnan told reporters that <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] justices are required to submit an accounting of their assets when they assume their post and to amend that accounting when they acquire new property. He also said that because justice positions are constitutional rather than governmental, this asset list and some other information on the justices were not publicly available through India&#39;s <a href="http://www.rti.gov.in/Members/aboutrti">Right to Information Act</a> [RTI materials], but that the <a href="http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/">Indian Parliament</a> [official website] did have the power to enact laws requiring more judicial accountability if they chose to.

Under the law, a candidate that seeks a nomination from multiple parties will be banned from appearing on the ballot if any one of those parties rejects his candidacy.  The ACLU is representing <a href="http://www.voteplatt.com/">Eugene Platt</a> [campaign website], a candidate for the state House who won the endorsement of the Green Party but not the Democratic Party.  The <a href="http://www.scvotes.org/">South Carolina Election Commission</a> [official website] blocked Platt from running as the Green Party candidate.  The ACLU argues that the &quot;sore loser&quot; law violates the right to free association guaranteed by the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution.  The <em>Post and Courier</em> has <a href="http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/aug/08/aclu_files_suit_supporting_platts_right_50180/">local coverage</a>.  The <em>Fort Mill Times</em> has <a href="http://www.fortmilltimes.com/124/story/249521.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In January, the <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/">ACLU of Michigan</a> [advocacy website] filed a federal suit <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/aclu-challenges-michigan-election-law.php">challenging a Michigan election law</a> [JURIST report] that limited access to information on presidential primary voters to the Democratic and Republican parties. The <a href="http://aclumich.org/pdf/primarycomplaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleged that <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(h3kitznxulw4co45xqbs02ak))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-168-615c">Section 615c</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ulh3ncqd4y0z5n55p10knz45))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-Act-116-of-1954">Michigan Election Law</a> [text] was unconstitutional because it excludes other smaller parties, as well as individuals, citizen groups and news media, from seeing lists of voter preferences and gives preference only to the two major parties in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell Law backgrounders].

M.C. suffers from severe mental and emotional health problems, and in 2002 he was placed in a special education program designed to control his repeated outbursts.  The Court ruled that the district court erred in not granting qualified immunity to the three individual defendants:<blockquote>Temporarily removing M.C., given the threat he often posed to the emotional, psychological, and physical safety of the students and teachers, was eminently reasonable...We therefore find that there was no Fourth Amendment violation here, and that the three individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.<br /><br />The district court found that the timeouts were designed both to punish M.C., and to educate him.  Under either rationale, there has been no constitutional violation...To determine what process is due, courts must balance: (1) the private interests that will be affected by the official action; (2) the risk of erroneous deprivation; and (3) the burden on the government from additional procedural requirements... We are reluctant to limit a teacher&#8217;s ability to manage her classroom by requiring her to give the student a &#8220;hearing&#8221; of some form.</blockquote>Originally Ms. Couture had filed an administrative action against APS and the individual defendants based on violations of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:h.1350.enr:">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (IDEA) [text], the <a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/leg/rehabact.doc">Rehabilitation Act</a> [text, DOC], and Title II of the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [official website].  These claims were dismissed and Ms. Couture appealed to the <a href="http://www.nmcourt.fed.us/web/index.htm">Federal District Court of New Mexico</a> [official website], where she added the claims that her son&#39;s constitutional rights were violated.<br /><br />In 2005, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/supreme-court-rules-parents-have.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that parents who challenge special education programs for not meeting their children&#39;s needs must bear the burden of proving the programs&#39; inadequacies, and that school officials need not meet any burden of proof in the matter.  In 2004, President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/bush-signs-disabilities-education-bill.php">signed IDEA</a> [JURIST report], legislation designed to ensure that students with disabilities would have special education teachers with the necessary skills and training. Bush was subsequently criticized for underfunding the related programs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on Tuesday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/07-5257-1132633.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the dismissal of a lawsuit against members of the Bush administration which was brought by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A58650-2003Oct7?language=printer">Valerie Plame</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> profile], the former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative whose disclosed identity precipitated the 2003 <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">CIA leak scandal</a> [JURIST news archive].  The appellate court found that the officials who allegedly leaked information about Plame&#39;s identity were acting within the scope of their employment, and such government workers are generally protected by qualified immunity.  Dissenting in part, Justice Rogers disagreed with the court&#39;s finding that the lawsuit &#8220;would inevitably require judicial intrusion into matters of national security and sensitive intelligence information,&#8221; and wrote: <blockquote>The disclosure concerns identified by the court as counselling hesitation are either unfounded or premature because there has been no discovery or presentation by the Wilsons to the district court of how they will attempt to prove their claims. Contrary to separation of powers, then, the court effectively cedes to Congress the judiciary&#8217;s defined role to decide issues arising under the Constitution</blockquote>Last month, US District Judge John Bates had <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-dismisses-plame-cia-leak.php">dismissed</a>  [JURIST report] the lawsuit, ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction over her tort claim. AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080812/pl_nm/usa_cheney_plame_dc_2">more</a>.<br /><br />The suit, <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/plame-sues-cheney-libby-rove-over-cia.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] last year against Vice President Dick Cheney, White House Deputy Chief of Staff <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/results/leadership/bio_383.html">Karl Rove</a> [official profile], and former vice-presidential aide <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scooter+libby">I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby</a> [JURIST news archive], asserted that they and 10 unnamed administration officials violated Plame&#39;s rights to privacy, free speech, and equal protection under the US Constitution by conspiring to expose her, threatening her career and endangering her family. Plame contends that the defendants revealed her identity as an undercover CIA operative in retaliation for the statements made by her husband, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3156166.stm">former US ambassador Joseph Wilson</a> [BBC profile], in which he denied Bush administration claims that Saddam Hussein had attempted to purchase materials for a nuclear weapon. Libby was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/libby-found-guilty-in-cia-leak-trial.php">convicted</a> in March 2007 of perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the case and <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/libby-sentenced-to-30-months-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 30 months in prison and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Georgia is forcibly detaining Russian citizens within its borders in violation of international law, <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">Russian President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] said in a Monday <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/08/11/1751_type82913type82914_205133.shtml">communication</a> with Minister of Internal Affairs Rashid Nurgaliev.  In the communication, Medvedev instructed Nurgaliev to ensure that the rights of ethnic Georgians in Russia are protected:<blockquote>I have received information, and you have probably also heard this, that the Georgian authorities are forcibly detaining Russian citizens on Georgian territory. This is, of course, in complete violation of international law. I do not know why they are doing this. Maybe they think they can use these people as a human shield. This is a completely unacceptable situation.<br /><br />I also want to say - and I want you to take this under your personal control &#8211; that all citizens of foreign states, who are legally in Russia, must not be subjected to any kind of discrimination and can remain in Russia in accordance with the agreements that our country has with the countries from which these people have come. Supervision of these matters is the Ministry of Internal Affairs&#39; responsibility and I ask you to ensure it is carried out.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=1">Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] denied the allegations as <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=36&info_id=7255">&quot;an absolute lie&quot;</a> [press release.] Also Monday, Georgia <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=36&info_id=7239">levied similar accusations of mass detentions against Russia</a> [press release]:<blockquote>According to the reliable information held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia, Russian servicemen and separatists carry out mass arrests of peaceful civilians of Georgian origin still remaining on the territory of the Tskhinvali region and subsequently concentrate them on the territory of the village of Kurta. <br /><br />Georgia appeals to the International Red Cross and other humanitarian and international organizations and the international community as a whole to immediately take decisive and effective measures for the evacuation of this population from the conflict zone.</blockquote>CNN has <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/11/georgia.conflict.russia/index.html?iref=mpstoryview">more</a>.<br /><br />International human rights groups on Saturday condemned any violence Russian or Georgian forces might commit against civilians in the separatist region of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/3797729.stm#leaders">South Ossetia</a> [BBC backgrounder], warning that those actions may amount to war crimes.

On Saturday, Russia <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7548715.stm">sent troops</a> [BBC report] into South Ossetia in what it called a mission to protect civilians.  Analysts say the current fighting marks the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/georgia-human-rights-lawsuit-harming.php">continuing deterioration</a> [JURIST report] in Georgian-Russian relations. Recent conflicts have included <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/georgian-republic-government-declares.php">accusations by Georgian authorities</a> [JURIST report] that Russia instigated protests calling for an overthrow of the government last November, and allegations of Russia&#39;s role in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/georgian-republic-sentences-opposition.php">coup plot</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007.

		<title>Mukasey against prosecuting DOJ officials involved in hiring scandal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Department of Justice (DOJ) officials accused of politicizing the hiring process will likely not face criminal prosecution, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael Mukasey</a> [official profile] told members of the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> [official website] on Tuesday. Mukasey <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2008/ag-speech-0808121.html">criticized</a> [prepared remarks; <a href="http://www.abavideonews.org/ABA531/av.php?id=264&type=v">recorded video</a>] DOJ officials for considering political affiliation in assessing job applicants, but noted that employees hired under the politicized process were not necessarily less qualified:<blockquote>[S]ome commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct. Where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing, we vigorously investigate it. And where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime, we vigorously prosecute. But not every wrong, or even every violation of the law, is a crime. In this instance, the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws...<br /><br />...Other critics have suggested that we should summarily fire or reassign all those people who were hired through the flawed processes described in the joint reports. But there is a principle of equity that we all learned in the schoolyard, and that remains as true today as when we first heard it: two wrongs do not make a right. As the Inspector General himself recently told the Senate Judiciary Committee, the people hired in an improper way did not, themselves, do anything wrong. It therefore would be unfair &#8211; and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections &#8211; to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause.<br /><br />Also, that some of the officials involved in hiring gave improper consideration to politics does not mean that the people they hired are unqualified for their jobs. I am a former federal judge. I will disclose to you in this room, as I did more than once in the courtroom where I used to preside, that I did not sit for a competitive examination to get that job, nor did any of my colleagues, and I do not flatter myself with the thought that my selection was in any rigorous sense a merits appointment. Politics can and does play a role in the appointment of federal judges, but it doesn&#39;t follow from that that federal judges are unqualified to do their jobs.</blockquote> Congressional Democrats criticized Mukasey for his comments, accusing him of being too quick to dismiss prosecution.  Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200808/081208a.html">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Attorney General Mukasey&#39;s blanket conclusions appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the Inspector General have uncovered so far.  The White House stonewalling continues, with aides refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas and testify about their role in the politicization of the Department of Justice.  The Attorney General, the nation&#8217;s top law enforcement officer, seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability.  We must continue to pursue the truth and facts, and hold any wrongdoers accountable.</blockquote>AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//ap/20080812/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/mukasey_lawyers_17">more</a>. RTTnews has  <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20080812%5CACQRTT200808121446RTTRADERUSEQUITY_1065.htm&&mypage=newsheadlines&title=Mukasey%20Says%20No%20Prosecution%20In%20Politicized%20Justice%20Dept.%20Hirings">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the DOJ Offices of Inspector General and Professional Responsibility concluded in a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opr/goodling072408.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/doj-report-says-officials-employed.php">report</a>]  that department aides illegally made hiring decisions based on consideration of applicants&#39; political and ideological beliefs. In early 2007, officials began <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/justice-department-investigating.php">investigating allegations</a> [JURIST report] that former DOJ aide <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Monica+Goodling">Monica Goodling</a> [JURIST news archive] and two other aides considered the political affiliations of candidates for career prosecutor positions in the Department, contrary to <a href="http://www.osc.gov/documents/pubs/rights.htm">federal law</a> [OSC backgrounder] and internal practices.  The report also concluded that Goodling and one of the other aides committed misconduct through their actions. It recommended that the DOJ consider the aides&#39; actions if any sought DOJ employment, while noting they could not currently be sanctioned because they had all resigned. Mukasey <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/July/08-opa-658.html">responded</a> [press release] that the DOJ had made institutional improvements since the investigation began and would implement the Offices&#39; new recommendations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/judgment-exxon-shipping-8-12-08.pdf">declined to rule</a> [order, PDF] on whether <a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com/corporate/">Exxon Mobil</a> [corporate website] owes interest on a punitive damages award entered against it for the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/emergencies/content/learning/exxon.htm">1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> [EPA backgrounder].  In June, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-219.ZO.html">ruled 5-3</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-child-rape-sixth.php">report</a>] to reduce a punitive damages award to be paid by Exxon from $2.5 billion to $500 million, but did not rule on the issue of interest.  Exxon then petitioned the Court for clarification of that issue. On Tuesday, the Court vacated the judgment below and remanded the matter to the US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].  Exxon has argued that if it is required to pay interest on the award, it should only have to pay that which has accrued since the Supreme Court awarded damages, rather that which has accrued since a federal jury first awarded damages in 1994.   AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080813/D92H2Q200.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In December 2006, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/appeals-court-chops-2-billion-off.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] Exxon&#39;s original $5 billion punitive damage award by over $2 billion, <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/0333BD942E7EA5AA8825724C0059D92E/$file/0435182.pdf?openelement">ruling</a> [PDF, text] that the award was excessive in light of a 2003 US Supreme Court ruling that punitive damages must be reasonable and proportionate to the harm incurred, and also considered Exxon&#39;s cleanup and compensation efforts.  On Wednesday, the US <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/">Coast Guard</a> [official website] resumed investigatory hearings into another <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/coast-guard-begins-investigation-of.php">tanker collision</a> [JURIST report] which caused the spilling of approximately 400,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi River on July 23, resulting in the temporary closure of a 100-mile stretch of the waterway.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/">US Coast Guard</a> [official website] on Wednesday resumed its investigatory hearings into a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/24/AR2008072403476.html">collision between a barge and a tanker</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] which caused the spilling of approximately 400,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi River on July 23, resulting in the temporary closure of a 100-mile stretch of the waterway.  Three foreign crew members from the <em>Tintomara</em>, the Liberian tanker ship that crashed into a barge loaded with fuel oil, are expected to be among the first witnesses questioned.  Formal legal proceedings began in New Orleans on Tuesday, but Lt. Cmdr. Melissa Harper, the Coast Guard officer in charge of the <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/08/oil_spill_hearing_to_convene_t.html">trial-like investigation</a> [<em>Times-Picayune</em> report], adjourned the hearing in order to give the parties one more day to review the voluminous documents.  The tug boat pushing the barge was driven by an apprentice pilot, John Paul Bavaret II, who has elected to represent himself.  Following Harper&#39;s questioning of the witnesses, Bavaret and the other interested parties, including the barge&#39;s owner, a staffing company, the <a href="http://www.ntsb.gov/">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) [official website], and the nation of Liberia, will all have a chance to question the crew members.  A formal list of witnesses expected to be called during the investigation has not yet been released.  KATC has <a href="http://www.katc.com/Global/story.asp?S=8829229">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />While it is unclear if the Coast Guard will seek criminal charges against any of the crew involved in the Mississippi river spill, earlier this year federal charges were brought against Capt. John Joseph Cota, the California maritime pilot accused in the November 2007 spill of approximately 58,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil in the San Francisco Bay.  Following preliminary <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-coast-guard-begins-criminal.php">Coast Guard and NTSB investigations</a>, Cota was charged with <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/ship-pilot-faces-new-felony-charges-in.php">two felony counts of making false statements</a> to the Coast Guard on required annual medical forms, along with <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/ship-pilot-faces-environmental-charges.php">misdemeanor environmental violations</a> [JURIST reports] of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/region5/water/cwa.htm">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/usc_sup_01_16_10_7.html">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a> [texts] due to his allegedly negligent behavior.

The <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/oios/">Office of Internal Oversight Services</a> (OIOS) [official website] began the investigation in May after receiving reports that some troops had paid for sex with Congolese minors. Condemning the alleged abuses if true, Ban&#39;s spokesperson stated:<blockquote>The Secretary-General is deeply troubled by the outcome...  He reiterates, in the strongest possible terms, that such behaviour, if substantiated, is wholly unacceptable and that disciplinary action to the maximum degree permitted by Indian law should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct... The Secretary-General highly values India&#8217;s long-standing and valuable support for United Nations peacekeeping.  He expresses his respect for all those peacekeepers from India and other troop-contributing countries who serve with honour and commitment, and stresses that the misconduct of a few should not diminish the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the large number of Blue Helmets who serve the cause of peace.</blockquote>In response to the report, the Indian army has <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080061271">begun its own internal investigation</a> [PTI report] into the allegations, a move praised by the UN.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] on Tuesday reached a <a href="http://www.nwirp.org/UDocuments/Announcements/NaturalizationDelaysSettlementAgreement.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [PDF text] in a federal class action suit brought by two pro-immigration advocacy groups seeking to force the government to rule on the naturalization applications of over 350 immigrants living in Washington state. The settlement, still subject to approval by a US district court judge, would require the government to decide on the applications of all remaining class members by October 18 and reimburse the plaintiffs for $185,000 in attorneys fees.    The <a href="http://www.nwirp.org/">Northwest Immigration Rights Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a>  (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/337277_immigration30.html">lawsuit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Seattle Pi</span> report] last October after immigrants complained that delays in the processing of their applications for citizenship violated federal law, which states in relevant part: <blockquote>[A] decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization.</blockquote>Immigrants may seek naturalization before a district court under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001447----000-.html">8 USC 1447(b)</a> [text] if the US <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis">Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services</a> [official website] has failed to make a determination within 120 days. The government has stated that the delays were necessary for the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] to run security checks on applicants.  The government was not required to admit any fault, wrongdoing or liability as a result of the settlement.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Seattle Times</span> has <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008109116_apwacitizenshipdelays1stldwritethru.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June 2007, the ACLU filed a separate <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/woods_v_myers_complaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</A> [petition, PDF; <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/detention/30102prs20070613.html">press release</A>] against federal immigration officials, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief on behalf of immigration detainees, alleging that <A src="/paperchase/2007/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-for-immigration.php">inadequate medical and mental health care</A> [JURIST report] at detention facilities has caused &quot;unnecessary suffering [and] avoidable death.&quot; Later that year, <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) said DHS policies for detainees with AIDS <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2007/us1207/">do not meet international and domestic standards of care</a> [report text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/dhs-immigration-detention-care-for-hiv.php">report</a>], and that the DHS consistently fails to enforce its own minimum standards. The DHS recently released a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xoig/assets/mgmtrpts/OIG_08-52_Jun08.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] stating that <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-immigration-agency-must-improve.php">do not always follow proper medical protocols</a> [JURIST report] when dealing with immigrants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Germany&#39;s <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20080806_1bvr319807.html">upheld</a> [ruling, in German; <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg08-080.html#top">press release</a>, in German] a state ban on smoking in public restaurants and bars in Bavaria.  The Bavarian ban is the strictest in the nation, where public smoking is regulated on a state-by-state basis.  Last month, the Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20080730_1bvr326207.html">ruled</a> [text, in German; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/germany-constitutional-court-overturns.php">report</a>] that several other state anti-smoking laws allowing bars to designate a separate room for smokers unconstitutionally discriminated against one-room establishments. The court held that that all publicly-accessible businesses must be treated equally before the law, so either smoking must be banned in bars entirely or the laws must be rewritten to create exemptions for smaller businesses. The Bavarian law was held to be constitutional because it does not include an exception for separate smoking rooms.  AP has <a href="http://www.lawinfo.com/legal-news-story.html?msgID=51C6F275-B43B-4943-BEA1-3563C1EA37A2">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, the federal government of Germany <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/germany-scraps-nationwide-smoking-ban.php">rejected a proposed nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants</a> out of concern that it would intrude on police powers guaranteed to the states in the wake of <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/germany-considers-largest.php">federalism reforms</a> which had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/germany-parliament-passes-major.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] that summer. Under the new constitutional reforms, Germany&#39;s 16 states have the power to regulate restaurants and businesses. Elsewhere in Europe, legislatures of <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/uk-cabinet-approves-english-smoking.php">England</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/france-to-impose-smoking-ban-in-all.php">France</a> [JURIST reports] have approved nationwide smoking bans in public places. In the US, voters in three states approved <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/smoking-bans-approved-in-three-states.php">state-wide smoking bans</a> [JURIST report] in the 2006 November elections, while Rhode Island amended its smoking ban after a state judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/rhode-island-may-amend-smoking-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of the law as irrational and therefore unconstitutional in 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] last week <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1310-11">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] a request made by six ethnic Uighur <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees to be transferred to less restrictive facilities within the base.  The petitioners argued that their solitary confinement in a higher security section of the base caused them mental suffering, but the court ruled that the detainees did not sufficiently demonstrate that they would suffer irreparable harm if they were not moved.  Judge Ricardo Urbina ruled:<blockquote>What is clear is that no court has ever ruled that detainees, designated as enemy combatants, have a right to challenge the conditions of their confinement pursuant to the constitutional writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. Furthermore, courts are reluctant to second-guess day-to-day operations of domestic prison facilities, especially when doing so intrudes upon the military and national security affairs. This deference combined with the paucity of evidence of irreparable injury and the petitioners&#39; failure to articulate a specific constitutional right and standard from which to analyze the facts of this case presses the court to deny the petitioners&#39; motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction.</blockquote>Guantanamo Bay currently houses 17 other Uighur enemy combatants who have been cleared for transfer out of the facility. <br /><br />In 2006, lawyers for several Chinese detainees still held at Guantanamo Bay <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/chinese-guantanamo-detainees-file.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in US federal court seeking their release due to alleged flaws in the process by which they were deemed enemy combatants. The group of seven ethnic Uighurs were deemed enemy combatants by Guantanamo&#39;s <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Combatant_Tribunals.html">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a> (CSRTs) [DOD materials], while five other Uighurs were cleared and <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">subsequently released</a> [JURIST report] from Guantanamo Bay. The new lawsuit alleged that the CSRTs relied on essentially the same evidence that was used to clear the five, and asserts that the detainees continued to be held as the result of a political agreement between China and the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/38B6F11040A8F38E882574A2004C6258/$file/0750402.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Monday that computer and PO box use restrictions placed on those convicted of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002252---A000-.html">child pornography offenses</a> [statute text] are reasonable as long as they are reasonably connected to their conviction and are construed narrowly enough to allow legitimate computer and mail use. The issue came before the court due to a challenge made by Robert Goddard against restrictions placed upon him as <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3583.html">conditions of his supervised release</a>&nbsp;[statute text] after he was convicted of downloading and possessing child pornography. The court clarified the limitations placed on computer use and upheld the PO box and other restrictions:<blockquote>We believe that two of the computer conditions are problematic if broadly construed, because they could be read to prohibit all use of a computer except for work and to make the use of a work computer impracticable. However, these conditions involve no greater a deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary if narrowly construed to allow personal computer use as approved by the probation officer and not to condition routine or automatic software additions, deletions, upgrades, updates, installations, repairs, or other modifications on prior approval. So construed, we approve the computer conditions and conclude that the remaining conditions are also reasonable. [citations omitted]</blockquote>Last month, New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile] wrote a <a href="http://www.broadbandreports.com/r0/download/1330518%7Eac9e421e02d7f4fb5de858f3fa4515ac/CuomoComcast.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/comcast-threatened-with-legal-action.php">report</a>] stating that his office would bring legal action against <a href="http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/About/Corporateinfo/Corporateinfo.html?lid=1AboutCorporateInfo&pos=Nav">Comcast Cable Communications</a> [corporate website] unless the company agrees to block child pornography websites and strengthen its reporting requirements.  In May, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-694.ZO.html">held</a> in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/univwil">United States v. Williams</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-supreme-court-rules-on-repeat.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2252A.html">PROTECT Act</a> [text], aimed at preventing the pandering or solicitation of child pornography, was not unconstitutionally broad or vague, unlike <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2256.html">similar laws</a> [Child Pornography Prevention Act] challenged in the past. The decision reversed a <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200415128.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF text] by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] on Tuesday issued a <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/115/Closing_order_indicting_Kaing_Guek_Eav_ENG.pdf">closing order</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/press/72/Closing_order_Duch_press_release.pdf">press release</a>] to officially indict former Khmer Rouge prison chief <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [TrialWatch profile], also known as Duch, on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions.  Duch is the first suspect to be charged since the tribunal was established in 2006.  No trial date has been set, although sources expect it to commence in September.  Duch, who was in charge of the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh, is one of five top leaders of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khmer+rouge">Khmer Rouge regime</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">backgrounder</a>] currently in ECCC custody.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080812/D92GN1801.html">more</a>. <br /><br />In April, ECCC officials said that the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eccc-aiming-to-end-investigation-into.php">expected to complete its investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Duch by July.  Duch was arrested in 1999 on genocide charges and was subsequently charged with <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/ex-khmer-rouge-prison-chief-faces-new.php">war crimes</a> by a military court in March and with <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-khmer-rouge-leader-charged-with.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST reports] by the ECCC in July. It is thought that those charges were brought to keep Duch in custody while the ECCC began its initial operations. A panel of ECCC judges ruled late last year that Duch <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/khmer-rouge-genocide-tribunal-denies.php">should not be granted bail</a> [JURIST report] while preparations for his trial continue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Danish court on Monday began the trial of two men accused of planning a bomb attack on the country. The pair admitted to manufacturing an explosive compound, but have denied that they were planning an attack or that they intended to use it to make a bomb.  A representative of the <a href="http://www.pet.dk/English.aspx">Danish Security and Intelligence Service</a> (PET) [official website] has said the unnamed men, one from Pakistan and the other from Afghanistan, are also suspected of having ties to <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Prosecutors in the case are heavily relying on covert surveillance evidence collected by PET and foreign intelligence agencies, including chat logs discussing the June <a href="http://www.pet.dk/English/News.aspx">bombing of the Danish embassy</a> [press release] in Pakistan. The men could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted, and a verdict in the trial is expected in October. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hIpaGOG5f80ECU1Sex46AcdfENPwD92G76A80">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Copenhagen Post</font> has <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/get/108672.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Covert and <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=electronic+surveillance">electronic surveillance</a> [JURIST news archive] methods such as those used by prosecutors in the case have recently become more widespread and have been criticized by privacy groups. In 2006, a Danish court ordered the continued detention of two men <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/denmark-charges-seven-in-connection.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in connection with an alleged terror plot set to take place in Denmark, but also ordered the release of five others who had been charged. The country was the focus of a worldwide controversy over <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon">cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] published by a Danish newspaper in 2005, which in early 2006 prompted other attacks on Danish embassies abroad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Attempts to bring war crimes suspect and former fugitive <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] to trial were long delayed by the US, France, and England, a former spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official site] said in a interview published in Serbian newspaper <a href="http://www.blic.co.yu/">Blic</a> [media website] on Sunday.   Florence Hartmann accused former US President Bill Clinton and former French President Jacques Chirac of interfering to prevent the arrest of Karadzic, and suggested that the US had only relented when it realized that his freedom was a stumbling block to stability in the region.  Hartmann made <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-and-allies-impeded-efforts-to.php">similar accusations</a> [JURIST report] last year in her <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/Paix-ch%C3%A2timent-Florence-Hartmann/dp/2081206692">memoirs</a> [book website], saying that the US and other western countries repeatedly impeded ICTY efforts to arrest Karadzic.  In her book, Hartmann also said that Russia aided in moving Karadzic to safety in Belarus, and alleged that the West helped in order to hide information about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>].

He went on to ask the Tribunal to order the appearance of not only Holbrooke, but also <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/former/40381.htm">former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright</a> [DOS profile] and two other officials allegedly involved in the deal. Holbrooke and Albright have denied the accusations, but Purdue University Professor <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/history/facstaff/Ingrao/H-Ingrao.htm">Charles Ingrao</a> [faculty profile], leader of a <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/history/facstaff/Ingrao/si/scholars.htm">research group</a> [Scholars&#39; Initiative website] dealing with issues of the former Yugoslavia, <a href="http://www.bosnia.org.uk/news/news_body.cfm?newsid=2458">said in an interview</a> [Bosnian Institute report] that he has independent evidence verifying Karadzic&#39;s claims.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan is merely going through the motions with its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">planned probe</a> [JURIST report] into Darfur human rights violations, said International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] in an <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28228">interview</a> [text] with the <em>Sudan Tribune</em> on Monday.  Moreno-Ocampo commented that Sudan does not have the political will to bring human rights offenders to justice, noting that an earlier Sudanese investigation into genocide claims was led by Minister for Humanitarian Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/icc-prosecutor-asks-judges-to-summon-ex.php">Ahmed Haroun</a> [JURIST report], himself wanted by the ICC:<blockquote>They did it many times. They end up investigating no one. They even appointed Haroun to head a committee on Darfur human rights. This is part of the cover up and they have been saying this for years. The only individuals prosecuted are those who resist illegal instructions to attack people in Darfur such as pilots or soldiers.</blockquote>  UPI has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/08/11/Prosector_Sudans_Darfur_probe_a_coverup/UPI-98161218465189/">more</a>.<br /><br />Sudan Justice Minister Abdel-Basit Sabdarat said last week that he had named one primary prosecutor and three assistants to investigate and try war crimes suspects from the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICC in the Netherlands currently handles such proceedings, but if Sudanese domestic courts are created with appropriate human rights and accountability safeguards, the ICC is required to hand over jurisdiction under Article 16 of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [PDF text]. The announcement is seen largely as a reaction to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">controversial effort</a> [JURIST report] to seek an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; ICC press release] for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>]. Both the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> (LAS) and the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official websites] have <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/arab-league-condemns-icc-prosecutor-for.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the warrant and underlying indictment, saying they threaten peace in the unstable country and that Sudan will create its own <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sudan-plans-to-create-domestic-courts.php">internationally-monitored courts</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/index.php">Philippines House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/billtext_14/hbt04253.pdf">bill</a> [HB 4253 text] on Monday to create a new national commission meant to guarantee the rights of Muslims citizens. The bill creates a National Commission on Muslim Filipinos to replace the existing <a href="http://www.oma.gov.ph/site/">Office of Muslim Affairs</a> (OMA) [official website], created in 1987.  The new commission will be responsible for addressing complaints of rights violations brought by Muslim citizens, for overseeing the development and distribution of lands traditionally held by Muslim Filipinos, and for advising the president on issues relevant to the country&#39;s Muslim population, as well as other duties previously held by the OMA.  House Speaker Prospero Nograles <a href="http://www.gov.ph/news/?i=21835">praised the measure</a> [government press release; House of Representatives <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/press/details.php?pressid=2527">press release</a>] as a way to &quot;ensure the rights and well-being of our Muslim brothers.&quot; The <em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em> has <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080811-153967/House-OKs-creation-of-new-Muslim-commission">more</a>.<br /><br />The government of the Philippines has been engaged in a long-standing conflict with Muslim rebels in the country&#39;s southern provinces.  In July, the government reached a peace agreement with rebels from the <a href="http://www.luwaran.com/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3003809.stm">backgrounder</a>], granting expanded boundaries to the country&#39;s southern <a href="http://www.armm.gov.ph/index.php?section=1">Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</a> (ARMM) [official website]. The two sides said they had also reached <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iBB5NIkDpLv3hZA456tIsqbjzASA">tentative agreements</a> [AFP report] on the distribution of mining revenues from the region, a timeline for local elections, and the implementation of new regulations.  The government <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/philippine-government-may-allow.php">first suggested</a> [JURIST report] that it might agree to increased autonomy for the region in 2005.  Earlier this month, a judge for the Supreme Court of the Philippines <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/183591-183752.pdf">enjoined</a> [ruling, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/philippines-high-court-blocks-signing.php">report</a>] government agents from signing the peace agreement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.pap.gov.pk/">Punjab Provincial Assembly</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/B89FE933AE884F2A652574A20053FB7D?OpenDocument">voted</a> [PTI report] to ask <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] to resign or face possible impeachment by the country&#39;s parliament. Of the body&#39;s 371 members, 321 voted for the motion, including the majority of Musharraf&#39;s own <a href="http://www.pml.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Q</a> [party website] party. In response to the vote and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">impeachment plans</a> [JURIST report] led by the country&#39;s coalition government, Musharraf stated he will <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/AB3D551C8D0A0A3E652574A2004D80F6?OpenDocument">fight the allegations of wrongdoing</a> and asserted that the Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) simply wants to <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/03FE66DCE2B0E998652574A2004E6A3E?OpenDocument">impose their rule</a> [PTI reports] over his own.  For the potential impeachment to succeed, it would require the endorsement of two-thirds of legislators in a joint session of parliament.  The lower house of parliament was scheduled to <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=42090fd0-8761-48e5-9f70-fd1fe735de78&ParentID=551df53c-297e-4935-8c49-d5fdaa142ad7&&Headline=All+set+for+Musharraf+impeachment">meet later on Monday</a>  [<font style="font-style:italic;">Hindustan Times</font> report] to consider the move. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7553206.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />PPP and coalition partner&nbsp;Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PMNL-N) leaders have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/porposed-pakistan-constitutional.php">disagreed</a> [JURIST report] on how to limit or amend Musharraf&#39;s powers, with the PML-N generally favoring resignation or impeachment and the PPP favoring working with Musharraf to improve the country&#39;s political system. PPP leaders took a tougher stance in June, stating that Musharraf was only president by default and warning that if he did not step down, the parliament would <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15195">impeach him</a> [<em>The News</em> report].  The PML-N then <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

According to a <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/08/14/did-wal-mart-violate-federal-election-laws-labor-groups-want-to-know/?mod=googlenews_wsj">report</a> [text] by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wall Street Journal</span> , the labor groups <a href="http://www.changetowin.org/">Change to Win</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwakeupwalmart.com%2F&ei=4uekSJCNEpm-eN7ymSg&usg=AFQjCNEMPpQIps0Mh5Cw6-T_FD8nTlC5Sw&sig2=FzbzVFXOD49plUMGoYnXcA">WakeUpWalMart.com</a>, <a href="http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/">Americans Rights at Work</a> [official websites], and the AFL-CIO filed the complaint based on Wal-Mart meetings which were intended to convince lower-level department heads that electing a Democratic president would make it easier for workers to unionize, which in turn could lead to lower salaries and violations of privacy.  According to the labor organizations, federal regulations allow companies to promote voting for a presidential candidate to high-level managers but not to lower-level managers and department heads.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/A546A718474C33ED882574A4007EE1A3/$file/0835209.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Thursday that Oregon Secretary of State <a href="http://www.sos.state.or.us/executive/aboutus/who/Bill_Bradbury/index.html">Bill Bradbury</a> [official profile] did not violate the constitutional rights of voters who signed a petition to hold a referendum on a <a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/07reg/measpdf/hb2000.dir/hb2007.intro.pdf">state law</a> [Oregon House Bill 2007, PDF] establishing same-sex domestic partnerships.  Bradbury struck over 200 signatures from the petition after officials found that many of the signatures did not match those on voter registration cards.  He then announced that the petition was approximately 100 signatures short of the required number. Voters were not permitted to contest the decision by introducing extrinsic evidence, and so signators brought suit, alleging violations of due process and equal protection guarantees.  The Ninth Circuit held that any burden placed on the plaintiffs&#39; fundamental right to vote was minimal and held that there had been no constitutional violations:<blockquote>[T]he Secretary&#8217;s procedures already allow chief petitioners and members of the public to observe the signature verification process and challenge decisions by county elections officials. The value of additional procedural safeguards therefore<br />is negligible, and the burden on plaintiffs&#8217; interests from the state&#8217;s failure to adopt their proposed procedures is slight at most.</blockquote>Plaintiffs had unsuccessfully asserted that Oregon was required to provide them with an opportunity to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; the stricken signatures, and also argued that the lack of uniform statewide rules for verifying referendum signatures violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html">Bush v. Gore</a> [Cornell case materials].  <br /><br />The <a href="http://ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> [official website] <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080202/D8UHVFFG0.html">ruled</a> [AP report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-judge-lifts-stay-on-oregon.php">report</a>] in February that the domestic partnership law should be allowed to take effect after it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-judge-suspends-oregon-domestic.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] last December.  Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oregon-gay-rights-bills-signed-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the bill into law last May after it was passed by the <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/oregon-house-passes-same-sex-civil.php">Oregon House</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/oregon-senate-approves-domestic.php">Oregon Senate</a> [JURIST reports]. The law would have taken effect on January 1 of this year had there been no lawsuit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday refused to grant a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> to convicted murder <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/oliverkhristian.htm">Khristian Oliver</a> [Texas Criminal Justice profile], who had argued that his Sixth and Eighth Amendment rights were violated when the jury took Bible passages into account when deliberating on his eventual death sentence. The <a href="http://www.txed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> [official website] had made a factual finding that the Bible did not influence the jury&#8217;s decision, and the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-70006-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Oliver did not present clear and convincing evidence rebutting that finding.  The parties agreed that a particular Bible passage was consulted by jurors: <blockquote>And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. Numbers 35:16-19 (King James).</blockquote>  The Circuits are split on the proper approach to interpreting whether the Bible constitutes an improper external influence.  The Fifth Circuit on Thursday held that in such a situation, &quot;the juror has crossed an important line.&quot;  <br /><br />The state of Texas has come under criticism lately for executing two foreign nationals after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/139/14637.pdf?PHPSESSID=39cdd63a2169a8c75c02f57dcf6db222">ordered</a> [press release and text] the US to stay such executions. Earlier this month, Texas <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] convicted murderer <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/chiheliberto.htm">Heliberto Chi</a> [Texas materials; <a href="http://www.cca.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/case.asp?FilingID=255177">docket information</a>], a Honduran man who had argued that he was improperly prevented from contacting his government in violation of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [PDF text].  Last month, lawyers for Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icj-to-rule-on-mexico-petition-to-halt.php">made a similar argument</a> [JURIST report] before the ICJ in an <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-mexico-national-in-face.php">unsuccessful attempt</a> [JURIST report] to block the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-mexico-national-in-face.php">execution</a> [JURIST report] of Mexican citizen <a href="http://www.asil.org/insights/2005/05/insights050531.html">Jose Ernesto Medellin</a> [ASIL backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medellin">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The United States and Libya <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/aug/108265.htm">reached an agreement</a> [US DOS press release; <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/aug/108251.htm">press statement</a>] on Thursday to settle all pending lawsuits brought by US terror victims against Libya, including 26 lawsuits related to the 1988 bombing of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6236538.stm">Pan Am Flight 103</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pan+Am+Flight+103">new archive</a>] over Lockerbie, Scotland.  The move is part of a continuing effort to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries.  Under the agreement, a fund will be started to compensate both US and Libyan victims of terrorism.  The agreement also gives Libyan officials immunity from future terror-related lawsuits brought by US citizens.  Some relatives of Flight 103 victims expressed anger at the deal.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080814/D92I78O80.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, US President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080804-2.html">signed</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bush-signs-bill-giving-libya-immunity.php">report</a>] into law the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.03370:">Libyan Claims Resolution Act</a> [S3370 materials], which allows the Secretary of State to settle remaining civil claims brought by US citizens against Libya for bombings allegedly carried out by groups linked to the government in the late 1980s. In May, the US and Libya <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-and-libya-discussing-expedited.php">agreed to seek resolution</a> of the outstanding claims against the country after President Bush had already <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bush-administration-seeks-to-exempt.php">urged Congress</a> [JURIST reports] to exempt the country from provisions of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.4986:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008</a> [HR 4986 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bush-administration-seeks-to-exempt.php">report</a>], which otherwise allows victims of state-sponsored terrorism to sue for that country&#39;s assets held in the US. In 2004, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/bushs-lifting-of-sanctions-against.php">lifted decades-old sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Libya after it agreed to dismantle its weapons programs and to acknowledge its history of state-sanctioned terror.

The court originally <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTQyMTYtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-4216-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl3f1/2/hilite">dismissed</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-arar.php">report</a>] Arar&#39;s lawsuit in July, ruling that he had failed to state a claim for which it had jurisdiction to grant relief.  The <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], which requested the rehearing, said that the decision to reconsider the case was &quot;extremely rare.&quot;  Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=an66zakGoMKY&refer=canada">more</a>.

He was later transferred to Syria, where he alleges he was tortured. Arar had <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-argues-appeal-rendition-victim-maher-arar:-u.s.-officials-must-be-held-a">argued</a> [CCR press release] that he should be able to challenge the US government&#39;s policy of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victim Protection Act</a> [text] and the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-174.htm">announced</a> [press release] on Wednesday that it has reached a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2008/34-58350.pdf">tentative agreement</a> [PDF text] with ten US stock exchanges to centralize insider trading controls among the institutions.  Under the plan, the programs to prevent and detect insider trading will be centrally controlled by the <a href="http://www.finra.org/">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) and a section of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyse.com/">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE) [corporate websites], instead of having each exchange run its own program. Under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2B.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [text], the markets are required to institute self-regulating controls, and the SEC has said the plan should make those controls more effective. In a <a href="http://www.finra.org/PressRoom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/P039066">press release</a> [text], FINRA Senior Executive Vice President Stephen Luparello praised the plan:<blockquote>While U.S. equity markets have always coordinated very well with each other to detect and investigate insider trading, this agreement takes insider trading surveillance to a new level because it consolidates within FINRA and NYSE Regulation what used to be 11 discreet programs at each market center... As a result, potential insider traders, whether acting alone or in concert with others, and regardless of where they trade in the U.S., will be more readily identified in this new, more unified structure.</blockquote> The SEC will vote on whether to officially sign off on the plan after a period reserved for public comment. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080813/bs_afp/usstocksregulatesec_080813182529">more</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.qwest.com/about/">Qwest Communications</a> [corporate website] released its <a href="http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/11/119535/2Q08EarningsRelease.pdf">second quarter earnings report</a> [press release; <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=119535&p=irol-reportsAnnual">materials</a>] this week, announcing an <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/qwest-to-settle-shareholder-suit-for.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] to pay an additional $40 million to settle a class action shareholder lawsuit resulting from an&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2005/12/former-qwest-ceo-charged-with-42.php">insider trading scandal</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report].&nbsp;Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/07-2626-01A.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/first-circuit-dismisses-claim-drug.php">report</a>] the dismissal of a shareholder securities suit against <a href="http://www.biogenidec.com/">Biogen Idec</a> [corporate website], in which the class of plaintiffs accused directors of violating the Securities Exchange Act&nbsp;by intentionally misrepresenting the safety of its multiple-sclerosis drug, <a href="http://www.tysabri.com/tysbProject/tysb.portal">Tysabri</a> [informational website], in order to sell their shares at high prices.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A New Orleans judge on Wednesday threw out indictments against the so-called <a href="http://www.danziger7.com/">&quot;Danziger Seven&quot;</a> [advocacy website], police officers accused of murder in the aftermath of <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive]. District Judge Raymond Bigelow ruled that prosecutors had violated state law by revealing grand jury testimony to a witness in the case and had also issued incorrect instructions to the grand jury.  The &quot;Danziger Seven&quot; were so named because of allegations that they shot mentally handicapped <a href="http://www.ndaonline.org/NDA%20Resolution%20for%20Madison%20_2_.pdf">Ronald Madison</a> [NDA resolution] as he crossed the Danziger Bridge in New Orleans to escape gunfire.  Police say that Madison moved as if to pull out a gun just before they opened fire, but these statements were contradicted by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/05/22/katrina.shotinback/index.html">autopsy results</a> [CNN report] showing Madison had been shot in the back.  Parish District Attorney Robert L. Freeman, Jr. said that prosecutors <a href="http://blog.nola.com/updates/2008/08/orleans_da_issues_statement_on.html">might appeal the decision</a> [press statement].  CBC News has <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/08/14/katrina-shootings.html">more</a>.<br /><br />New Orleans police faced intense criticism for their behavior after Katrina. Many have been accused of both brutality and <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/new-orleans-police-department-fires-45.php">deserting their posts</a> [JURIST report].  US federal prosecutions and convictions of law enforcement officers for alleged brutality have significantly increased in recent years, it was <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-12-17-Copmisconduct_N.htm?csp=15">reported</a> last year [<em>USA Today </em> report]. Unspecified Department of Justice statistics indicated that prosecutions for the use of excessive force or other violations of victims&#39; civil rights had risen 25 percent from 224 to 281 in 2001-2007 compared to the previous seven-year period.  In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/">1998 report</a> [HRW materials] Human Rights Watch called police brutality &quot;one of the most serious and divisive human rights violations in the United States.&quot; HRW maintains an archive of letters and press releases from advocacy groups on the subject, and in 2006 raised concerns over <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/08/10/usdom13960.htm">prisons affected by Hurricane Katrina</a> [letter].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indonesia&#39;s Constitutional Court has accepted  a death penalty challenge filed by three men condemned for their roles in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder].  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2542863.stm">Mukhlas</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2499943.stm">Imam Samudra</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2632043.stm">Amrozi Nurhasyim</a> [BBC profiles] argue that death by firing squad amounts to &quot;torture&quot; and is <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-01/2008-01-08-voa3.cfm?CFID=19277508&CFTOKEN=96779311">contrary to Islamic law</a> [VOA report].  Lawyers say that the court does not have the authority to delay the men&#39;s scheduled execution, but that it would be &quot;respectful&quot; for the government to issue a stay until the court completes its review.  The three men, all members of Southeast Asian terror group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>], <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5370994.stm">requested they be executed by beheading</a> [BBC report] rather than firing squad in a 2006 Supreme Court appeal.

Their first appeal had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/indonesia-high-court-rejects-final.php">rejected</a> late last year, prompting an unusual <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bali-bombers-bid-for-high-court-second.php">second appeal</a>, which was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bali-nightclub-bombers-withdraw-second.php">withdrawn</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, Indonesian police <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indonesia-police-arrest-alleged-2005.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] another JI member, Faiz Fauzan, in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4300274.stm">another set of Bali bombings</a> [BBC report] in 2005.

His indictment is the latest of several brought by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.bpr.gov.my/cda/m_home/index.php">Anti-Corruption Agency</a> (ACA) [official website], in what government officials have said is a new push to combat violations of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.bpr.gov.my/cda/m_perundangan/c_peruntukan.php">anti-graft laws</a> [statute materials]. Anti-corruption advocates were unimpressed with Mirza&#39;s arrest, saying there were much larger instances of corruption in need of investigation.  Mirza is scheduled to be tried in February 2009 and faces up to two years in prison if convicted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Nigeria officially turned over the entirety of the disputed <a href="http://www.un.org/events/tenstories/06/story.asp?storyID=900">Bakassi peninsula</a> [UN backgrounder] to neighboring Cameroon on Thursday, in compliance with a 2002 International Court of Justice (ICJ) <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&code=cn&case=94&k=74">ruling</a> [ICJ materials].  Basing its ruling on an old colonial agreement between England and Germany, the ICJ had ruled that the territory and its oil reserves should be handed over to Cameroon. Implementation of the ICJ ruling was handled by a special <a href="http://www.un.org/unowa/cnmc/bkground.htm">UN-appointed commission</a> [UN backgrounder], under which a withdrawal was eventually negotiated. Although the Nigerian military <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/nigeria-hands-part-of-disputed.php">withdrew from the northern part of the peninsula</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, the countries had agreed that rest of Bakassi would remain under Nigerian civilian control for two more years.  BBC New has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7559895.stm">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20080814%5CACQDJON200808140843DOWJONESDJONLINE000538.htm&&mypage=newsheadlines&title=UPDATE:%20Nigeria%20Cedes%20Bakassi%20Peninsula%20To%20Cameroon">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Most residents of Bakassi were Nigerian fishermen, most of whom have had to leave the peninsula to be resettled elsewhere in the country.  Many have criticized government resettlement efforts, which set aside landlocked areas to house the displaced fishermen, as destroying their way of life.  Nigeria and Cameroon&#39;s <a href="http://www.omoigui.com/files/the_bakassi_story.pdf">dispute over the territory</a> [backgrounder] had let to violent conflicts between 1981 and 1994.

Gregory Zanetti</a> [official profile], deputy commander at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation/v-print/story/640417.html">testified</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald</span> report]  Wednesday that <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] legal advisor <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Gen. Thomas Hartmann</a> [official profile] routinely bullied his counterparts and was inappropriately aggressive in seeking indictments against detainees.  Zanetti&#39;s testimony fit in with <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">earlier allegations</a> [JURIST report] that Hartmann worked too closely with commission prosecutors despite his purportedly neutral role.  Col. Lawrence Morris, the chief prosecutor in the case, said the complaints against Hartmann were more a function of personality conflicts than of actual misconduct. The testimony came at a hearing in the case of detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsJawad.html">Mohammed Jawad</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mohammed+jawad">news archive</a>], whose lawyers are seeking to have charges against him dismissed due to alleged misconduct by Hartmann.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Energy company <a href="http://www.kindermorgan.com/">Kinder Morgan Bulk Terminals</a> (KMBT) [corporate website] was sentenced Wednesday for its improper disposal of potash (potassium chloride) in violation of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/mprsa/02.htm">Ocean Dumping Act</a> [text].  In 2003, a KMBT employee dumped 160 metric tons of potash into the ocean after the substance came into contact with water and was therefore unsaleable.  KMBT will pay a $156,000 fine and make an $84,000 community service payment to the Oregon Governor&#39;s Fund for the Environment.  Calling KMBT&#39;s actions a &quot;costly&quot; violation of federal law, an EPA agent who investigated the incident <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/August/08-enrd-720.html">said</a> [DOJ press release]: <blockquote>It is hard to imagine a clearer violation of the Ocean Dumping Act...Intentionally using the ocean as a garbage can for off spec potash is not only morally wrong, it&#39;s a crime.  [KMBT] has paid a serious price for not taking care of this properly at the dock.</blockquote>KMBT <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=119776&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1187143&highlight=">said</a> [corporate press release] that as part of the settlement: <blockquote>The government and the company acknowledge in a joint factual statement filed with the court that no harm was done to the environment; the former employee&#39;s actions constituted a violation of company policy; the company did not benefit financially from the incident; and no [KMBT] personnel outside of the [incident] either approved or had any knowledge of the former employee&#39;s arrangements.</blockquote> <span style="font-style:italic;">Portland Business Journal</span> has <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/08/11/daily33.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In 2006, KMBT <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/environmental-brief-uk-environment.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Transportation&#39;s <a href="http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/">Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration</a> [official website] for damage caused by its Pacific network of petroleum pipelines.  Problems with the company&#39;s pipelines in the region have led to over 40 spills and ruptures, including a 2004 explosion in California that killed five construction workers.  KMBT agreed to spend $90 million over five years to improve its oil pipelines in the region.

		<title>Second Circuit rules publisher to retain rights to Steinbeck novels</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] held Wednesday that publisher <a href="http://www.pearson.com/index.cfm?pageid=32">Penguin Group</a> [corporate website] will retain the right to publish ten <a href="http://www.steinbeck.org/Bio.html">John Steinbeck</a> [National Steinbeck Center bio] novels. The heirs involved in this copyright action already receive a percentage of the sales proceeds, but initiated this action because they believed they were entitled to a greater portion.  The Second Circuit recognized the provision of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/copyright.table.html">Copyright Act</a> [text] granting authors and certain family members the power to terminate prior assignments of copyright because so many &quot;young authors enter into long-term contracts with publishers when their bargaining power is weak and their prospects for success uncertain,&quot; but held that this power is limited.  The Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTMyMjYtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-3226-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl3091/1/hilite">held</a> [opinion, PDF]: <blockquote>[U]nder our view, authors or their statutory heirs holding termination rights are still left with an opportunity to threaten (or make good on a threat) to exercise termination rights and extract more favorable terms from early grants of an author&#39;s copyright.  But nothing in the statute suggests that an author or an author&#39;s statutory heirs are entitled to more than one opportunity, between them, to use termination rights to enhance their bargaining power or to exercise them...In this case, Elaine Steinbeck had the opportunity in 1994 to renegotiate the terms of the 1938 Agreement to her benefit...By taking advantage of this opportunity, she exhausted the single opportunity provided by statute to Steinbeck&#39;s statutory heirs to revisit the terms of her late husband&#39;s original grants of licenses to his copyrights.  It is no violation of the Copyright Act to execute a renegotiated contract where the Act gives the original copyright owner&#39;s statutory heirs the opportunity and incentive to do so.</blockquote> The district court below had granted summary judgment for one of Steinbeck&#39;s sons and a granddaughter, finding that their 2004 &quot;notice of termination&quot; to Penguin Group superseded a 1938 copyright agreement between the publisher and the author.  Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-steinbeck14-2008aug14,0,1354397.story">more</a>. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1HBxtGQCgVaccHPM3X2w-6wxmSgD92HL8100">additional coverage</a>.  <br /><br />Results of a <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/">Computer and Communications Industry Association</a> (CCIA) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/artmanager/uploads/1/FairUseStudy-Sep12.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/artmanager/publish/news/First-Ever_Economic_Study_Calculates_Dollar_Value_of.shtml">press release</a>; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/fair-use-of-copyrighted-material.php">report</a>] released last year indicated that <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html">fair use exceptions</a> [Copyright Office backgrounder] to US copyright laws create more than $4.5 trillion in revenue in the US annually, employ millions of workers, and represented one-sixth of the total US GDP in 2006. The <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">Fair Use exception</a> [text] to US copyright law permits limited unauthorized use of copyrighted material for scientific, educational, journalistic, or research purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] California&#39;s court-appointed prison medical overseer <a href="http://www.mcgeorge.edu/x509.xml">J. Clark Kelso</a> [official profile] has asked the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] to force the state to pay $8 billion over the next five years to improve prison hospitals, according to court papers filed Wednesday.  Kelso has previously said that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=California+prisons+">California prisons</a> [JURIST news archive] need an influx of $7 billion to bring inmate healthcare up to constitutional standards, but that the state senate has been unwilling to authorize a bond to borrow money for the project.

On Monday, Schwarzenegger himself <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/politics/ci_10174417">filed a lawsuit</a> [<em>Mercury News</em> report] seeking to reduce many state employees&#39; pay to federal minimum wage in an effort to force legislators to meet budget deadlines.   The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/13/BA9U12ACV8.DTL">more</a>.<br /><br />In January, a federal judge <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/61fffe74f99516d088256d480060b72d/9d5bb7faba2e98c7882573d9006b34fe/$FILE/order%20appointing%20new%20receiver.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-judge-rules-california-prison.php">report</a>] that the healthcare provided in California prisons does not meet constitutional standards even though medical services have improved significantly since the <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/federal-judge-orders-oversight-of.php">court assumed oversight</a> [JURIST report] of the system in 2005.  Bringing the state&#39;s prison system up to constitutional standards could take as long as four years, according to officials at the <a href="http://www.cprinc.org/index.html">California Health Care Receivership</a> [official website].  In July 2007, the court <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judges-order-federal.php">ordered the formation of a special three-judge panel</a> [JURIST report] to supervise and reduce California&#39;s prison population after finding that California&#39;s prison overcrowding was preventing the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) [official website] from adequately providing mental health care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand Supreme Court vice president Krairiksh Kasemsant and army General Anupong Paochinda on Wednesday said there was no evidence to support accusations by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] that the country&#39;s judiciary is biased against the former leader. Thaksin,who faces numerous corruption charges,&nbsp;most recently made the claim Monday when he announced that he and&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">his wife </a><a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive] would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-high-court-issues-arrest.php">not return to Thailand</a> [JURIST report] from a trip to the UK. The two had been out on bail, and the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129527">issued warrants for their arrest</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] when they failed to make a court appearance. The Thai government is reportedly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aLW48ApiqMnc&refer=asia">seeking their extradition</a> [Bloomberg report] from the UK and will retain their nearly $400,000 in bail. Earlier this month, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] Thaksin&#39;s constitutional challenge to the commission that had brought charges against him.&nbsp;Thaksin had&nbsp;argued that the commission&#39;s governing statute imposed an unreasonable violation of his and his wife&#39;s rights to individual liberty. From Thailand, the <font style="font-style:italic;">Nation</font> has <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/08/13/politics/politics_30080413.php">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution that reduced fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. In April, Pojamarn <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/thailand-ex-pm-returning-in-may-to-face.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of conflict of interest and malfeasance stemming from a 2003 agreement with the government-directed <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website] to purchase land said to be worth three times more than the $26 million she paid for it. Lawyers for Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawyer-for-ex-thailand-pm-jailed-for.php">have been jailed</a> [JURIST report] for attempting to bribe court officials in one of Thaksin&#39;s cases, and current Thai <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] is <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">facing possible impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] due in part to his party&#39;s close association with Thaksin. Thaksin and Pojamarn had been in self-imposed exile from Thailand after Thaksin was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">ousted in a military coup</a>  in 2006, but had <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/thailand-ex-pm-returns-to-face.php">returned to the country earlier this year</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani President <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] should resign from office immediately, US Senator <a href="http://harkin.senate.gov/">Tom Harkin</a> (D-IA) [official website] said in a statement released on Monday. The same day that Pakistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.pap.gov.pk/">Punjab Provincial Assembly</a> [official website]  <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-assembly-votes-for-musharraf.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to ask Musharraf  to resign or face possible impeachment by the country&#39;s parliament, Harkin <a href="http://adeebpress.wordpress.com/">said</a> [text]:<blockquote>Members of Pakistan&#39;s Punjab province local assembly&#39;s vote today continues to pressure President Musharraf to leave office. In the coming days, other provinces will have their say through a process of non-binding votes. I urge all political parties not to lose sight of the impact on the Pakistani people - long-standing friends of the Americans. <br /><br />Today in Pakistan, the judges removed by Musharraf have yet to be restored, inflation is at an all time high and clashes occur frequently in tribal areas between Pakistan forces and &#39;Taliban&#39; insurgents. One thing is for certain: it is time for the violence, blood shed and fear to cease and the confidence of the Pakistani<br />people to be restored.<br /><br />In order to re-establish the rule of law, return the High Court judges to their official posts and get back to solving the day-to-day challenges of the Pakistani people, President Musharraf should strongly take into consideration the will of the Pakistani people and step-down. There are significant challenges that the leaders of Pakistan must confront in order to ensure the most basic needs for the people of Pakistan, and President Musharraf no longer seems to enjoy the confidence of the Pakistani people that will be necessary to move the country forward.<br /><br />I have great respect, admiration and affection for the Pakistani people. I have spoken out many times in the US Senate for closer ties between the people of the US and the people of Pakistan. I count among my friends and leaders in different Pakistani political parties. My hope is for a better life for all Pakistani people, under a rule of law, in free, open, democratic society.</blockquote>Of the Punjab Provincial Assembly&#39;s 371 members, 321 voted for the impeachment motion, including the majority of Musharraf&#39;s own <a href="http://www.pml.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Q</a> [party website] party. In response to the vote and <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">impeachment plans</a> [JURIST report] led by the country&#39;s coalition government, Musharraf stated he will <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/AB3D551C8D0A0A3E652574A2004D80F6?OpenDocument">fight the allegations of wrongdoing</a> and asserted that the Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) simply wants to <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/03FE66DCE2B0E998652574A2004E6A3E?OpenDocument">impose their rule</a> [PTI reports] over his own.  ANI has <a href="http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/11395">more</a>.  <br /><br />Last week, Musharraf affirmed his <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/08/top1.htm">June vow</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] that he will neither step down nor go into exile, despite the recent pressure from opposition forces. Also last week, Pakistan&#39;s coalition government said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">push to impeach Musharraf</a> [JURIST report], a move that would require the endorsement of two-thirds of legislators in a joint session of parliament.  The Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) and coalition partner Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) officials have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/porposed-pakistan-constitutional.php">disagreed</a> [JURIST report] on how to limit or amend Musharraf&#39;s powers, with the PML-N generally favoring resignation or impeachment and the PPP favoring working with Musharraf to improve the country&#39;s political system. PPP leaders took a tougher stance in June, stating that Musharraf was only president by default and warning that if he did not step down, the parliament would <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=15195">impeach him</a> [<em>The News</em> report]. Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French judges have launched an investigation into torture allegations by a Palestinian doctor who was detained in <a href="/countries/libya.php">Libya</a> [JURIST news archive] for eight years after being accused of deliberately infecting hundreds of children with HIV, a judicial official said Tuesday.  Last year, Ashraf Jima Hajuj <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/palestinian-doctor-files-french-lawsuit.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in France against <a href="http://www.algathafi.org/html-english/index.htm">Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi</a> [official website], relying on France&#39;s accession to the 1984 UN <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text], which allows signatory countries to take legal action against torture suspects who enter their territory. Gaddafi had arrived in France that week for a five-day visit, but as a head of state, he may enjoy immunity. In January, Hajuj also filed a complaint with the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/6/hrc.htm">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website] against Libya, alleging he was tortured during his detention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.wyd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Wyoming</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/legal/judge_brimmer_judgement_081208.pdf">granted the state an injunction</a> [decision, PDF] prohibiting the <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a>&nbsp;(NFS) [NFS materials] from enforcing a <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/rule/roadless_fedreg_rule.pdf">2001 rule</a> [PDF text] prohibiting the construction of roads and other developments in designated wilderness areas.  Writing for the court, Judge Clarence Brimmer said that the rule violated both the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC4321">National Environmental Policy Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=legisAct">Wilderness Act</a> [texts]. The state had brought a complaint against the agency in 2003, but the lawsuit was <a href="http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2005/07/03-8058.htm">eventually dismissed</a> [opinion] after the rule was superseded by an order from President George Bush in 2005. A judge in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/roadless/judge_laporte_decision112906.pdf">reinstated the 2001 rule</a> [decision, PDF] in 2006, but Brimmer found that decision to be erroneous. The California ruling is pending appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and wilderness advocates have said they <a href="http://www.wilderness.org/NewsRoom/Statement/20080812.cfm">plan to appeal</a> the Wyoming decision to the Tenth Circuit. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hTsPr6DcfwgQaHqdmVfHwZW1vHhgD92H4RCO2">more</a>. <br /><br />In July, an <em>en-banc</em> panel of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/Documents.nsf/54dbe3fb372dcb6c88256ce50065fcb8/706cfc8a9f0494f38825747a00662dd7/$FILE/0735000.pdf">ruling</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-refuses-to-interfere-with.php">report</a>] granting broad deference to the NFS when making decisions regarding the impact of logging on national forests.&nbsp;In late June, the same panel <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/1A2A49E9939948C788257472008188F7/$file/0735804.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [PDF text, AP <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/368468_logging26.html">report</a>] that the NFS generally has the prerogative to determine which trees are candidates for clearing after after a forest fire, but directed the agency to more thoroughly consider whether any logging should be done in certain wilderness areas. In May, the court <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/library/legal_docs/sierra-9th-cir-decision-051408.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-forest.php">report</a>] a lower court order denying an injunction against a NFS plan to allow commercial logging in another forest to help pay for a wildfire prevention program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese media reported Friday that the Shanghai Municipal First Intermediate People&#39;s Court sentenced a former city official to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+death+penalty">death</a> [JURIST news archive] after being convicted of multiple corruption charges on Thursday, though the sentence will not be imposed for another two years. Former deputy director of the <a href="http://www.shfdz.gov.cn/english/">Shanghai Housing, Land and Resources Administration Bureau</a> [official website, English version] Yin Guoguan was suspected of using city pension funds to make loans for real estate purchases. The court sentenced him to death for accepting bribes and for possession of ammunition, six years in prison for abuse of authority, and four years in prison for possessing property of unknown origin. The death sentence could eventually be reduced to a sentence of life in prison. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080815/D92IJFUO0.html">more</a>. Xinhua has <a href="http://www.sh.xinhuanet.com/2008-08/15/content_14130750.htm">local coverage</a>, in Chinese.<br /><br />China has taken a hard line on corruption in recent years, punishing several officials with lengthy prison terms or <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/china-ex-prosecutor-gets-suspended.php">execution</a> [JURIST report]. In January, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/china-issues-anti-corruption-rules-for.php">issued new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] for public officials. In December 2007, a former prosecutor received a <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/china-ex-prosecutor-gets-suspended.php">suspended death sentence</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted of accepting bribes and embezzling money. In September 2007, a former official of the Agricultural Bank of China was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/china-executes-bank-official-for-taking.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] for taking bribes and embezzling nearly $2 million. In July 2007, the former commissioner of China&#39;s State Food and Drug Administration was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/china-executes-former-drug-safety.php">executed for accepting $850,000 in bribes</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indonesian prisoners who have been convicted of terrorism, drug offenses, illegal logging and corruption this year did not receive the sentence reductions that most of the prisoners traditionally receive on Indonesia&#39;s <a href="http://www.123independenceday.com/indonesia/">Independence Day</a> [backgrounder], August 17. Indonesian officials previously said that sentence reductions were a constitutional right afforded to all criminals regardless of their crimes, as part of Indonesia&#39;s prisoner remission program <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24185451-12335,00.html">conducted annually</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Australian </font>report] to mark the country&#39;s independence from Dutch colonial rule. Prisoners in good standing typically received a remission unless they were on death row or serving life sentences, but this year, increasing concerns over crime and the country&#39;s image as <a href="http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2007">one of the most corrupt</a> [rankings list; regional <a href="http://www.transparency.org/content/download/23975/358245">analysis</a>, PDF] worldwide contributed to the change of policy. This Independence day, it is estimated that 55,000 prisoners received sentence reductions of up to six months, and another 5,700 were released. AP has <a href="http://ph.news.yahoo.com/ap/20080815/tap-as-indonesia-sentences-64ed358.html">more</a>.  The Jakarta Post has <a href="http://old.thejakartapost.com/detailnation.asp?fileid=20080818.G01">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />For Independence Day in 2006, Indonesian authorities cut the sentences of 54,000 prisoners, including to 10 men involved in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/12/newsid_2543000/2543731.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a>. Those remissions <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/060817/1/42un2.html">sparked public outcries</a> [AFP report], particularly in Australia.  Nearly half of the victims of the 2002 nightclub bombings hailed from Australia.  In June 2006, <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/">Australian Prime Minister John Howard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-distressed-over-release-of.php">denounced the release</a> of an Indonesian Muslim cleric <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/indonesian-cleric-found-guilty-in-bali.php">convicted on conspiracy charges</a> in relation to the bombings.  His <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/bali-bombers-get-independence-day.php">sentence was reduced</a> [JURIST reports] during the 2005 remission program.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani President <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] announced Monday he was <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/NewsEventsDetail.aspx?NewsEventID=4101">resigning from office</a> [press release] in order to avoid impeachment proceeding by the country&#39;s parliament. In a <a href="http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/12219">television address</a> [ANI report], Musharraf denied any wrongdoing, but said that the proceedings alone would damage the country.  Earlier on Monday, <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [official websites] coalition leaders had said that they had <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=16666">finalized an impeachment charge sheet</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">News</span> report] against Musharraf and were planning to bring it before parliament as early as Tuesday.  Despite <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/PRPressReleaseDetail.aspx?nPRPressReleaseId=1995&nYear=2008&nMonth=8">repeatedly denying</a> [press release] rumors that he planned to step down, Musharraf began his address by citing improvements he said Pakistan had made under his leadership and concluded:<blockquote>Impeachment and chargesheet is the right of the Parliament and I have the right to defend myself against these charges. I am confident that no charge can be proved against me. All my actions were for the good of the people and the country. All my major decisions were the consent of all concerned and all stake-holders, e.g. services, bureaucracy, civil society, etc. I am not at all worried about the Charge-Sheet because nothing can be proved. But the larger issue is what is it going to cost Pakistan - its economy, political and social order, honour and prestige of the highest office of the state. Such are the considerations upper-most in my mind.<br /><br />Whether I&#39;m impeached or not, the country&#39;s stability will be compromised. The office of the president will also be insulted. Pakistan is my love; now and always, my life is for Pakistan. I have defended and will continue to defend Pakistan. I want to be able to bring Pakistan out of the current crisis so I think perhaps should do something. But I also do not want to do something that may generate uncertainty in the country. I also want to save the Parliament from horse-trading. Even if the impeachment is defeated, the relations between the President&#39;s office and the coalition govt. will not heal. Institutions will be endangered. Therefore, with this situation in view and having consulted my legal and political advisors, I have decided to resign from my post.<br /><br />I have decided to resign from the office of President and my resignation will be handed over to the Speaker of the National Assembly. I want the people to be the judges and let them decide my fate. I am a human being and may have committed follies.</blockquote>There has been speculation that Musharraf may leave the country to avoid criminal prosecution, but opponents have <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080062046&ch=8/18/2008%206:21:00%20PM">criticized the possibility</a> [IANS report] and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday that the US <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/08/18/top2.htm">would not grant him asylum</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Dawn</span> report]. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gk6dXIkPSQi2-tgtSMFU3usLnuhw">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">News</span> has <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/updates.asp?id=52487">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the coalition government said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">push to impeach Musharraf</a> because had given a &quot;clear commitment&quot; to step down from office after his party was defeated in <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-pakistan-parliament-could-reinstate.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST reports], but subsequently refused to resign or go into exile, and because be had failed to follow through on a promise to ask parliament for a confidence vote. &nbsp;In June, the PML-N <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Justice Department has sent so-called <a href="http://criminal.lawyers.com/drug-crimes/Federal-Crimes-FAQ.html#one">target letters</a> [backgrounder] to six <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">news archive</a>] guards involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">September 16 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report], the <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> [media website] reported Sunday. Sources told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span> that the letters, which provide an opportunity for the recipients to contest grand jury evidence, indicate the Justice Department will likely seek indictments against at least some of the guards under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> (MEJA) [text]. Indictments against the Blackwater employees under the MEJA would mark the first time that State Department contractors were prosecuted under the Act, which allows criminal charges to be filed against contractors working for the Department of Defense. The sources explained that a final decision on whether to indict the men may not be made until October. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/16/AR2008081601967.html?hpid=topnews">more</a>.<br /><br />The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. In November, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/middleeast/14blackwater.html?ex=1195707600&en=5cc8ef55f3b5b4bd&ei=5065&partner=MYWAY"><span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span></a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/14/AR2007111400222.html?nav=rss_world"><span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span></a> [texts] reported that an FBI investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report] and last month Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari announced that private security contractors operating in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/private-contractors-in-iraq-may-be.php">may be stripped of their immunity from prosecution</a> [JURIST report] under a US-Iraqi agreement currently in negotiations. Advocacy group <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/08115-usls-psc-final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] in January asserting that existing federal law is sufficient to prosecute private contractors using excessive violence in their overseas capacities, and that the US government is to blame for failing to &quot;develop a clear policy with respect to the accountability of private contractors for crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot; The report says that the MEJA could be extended to State Department contractors, but that the US has failed to do so.

Staff Sgt. Hal M. Warner, who was stationed about 130 miles north of Baghdad, was <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21586&Itemid=128">charged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/two-us-soldiers-charged-in-death-of.php">report</a>] early this month with premeditated murder, assault, accessory after the fact, making a false official statement and obstruction of justice in connection with the death of Ali Mansur Mohamed, a detainee originally thought to have been released from Coalition custody sometime around May 16. Warner was originally scheduled to appear for an <a href="http://www.jag.navy.mil/html/NLSOGlakesArticle_32_investigations.htm">Article 32 preliminary hearing</a> [JAG backgrounder] August 15. The trial for 1st Lt. Michael C.

AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-ye6oDn8ePefAl8Z3ZOfavTGsIw">more</a>.<br /><br />In March, US Marine Sgt. Ryan Weemer was <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Rel-08-001-080318.htm">charged</a> [press release] with one count of murder and one count of dereliction of duty for his involvement in the shooting death of a detained Iraqi insurgent during MNF-Iraq&#39;s <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/oif-phantom-fury-fallujah.htm">November 2004 offensive</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Investigation-Timeline.htm">Fallujah</a> [USMC timeline; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Fallujah">news archive</a>]. The charges against Weemer followed <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-marine-sergeant-re-charged-with.php">December 2007 charges</a> against Marine Sgt. Jermaine A.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials of Myanmar opposition group the National League for Democracy (NLD) said Sunday that the government has sentenced five of its members to prison for participating in a march commemorating the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7012158.stm">mass student protests</a> [BBC backgrounder] against the junta held on August 8, 1988. The 2008 protest, held in the Rakhine province, included 48 people, and police arrested the five NLD members on charges of creating public alarm and unlawful assembly. Government officials sentenced each on Friday to two and one-half years in prison. Rakhine NLD official Thein Naing told the media that the sentencing occurred without giving the party members the chance to consult a lawyer. Other party officials have expressed hope that a UN envoy&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27716&Cr=gambari&Cr1=">visit to Myanmar</a> [UN News Centre report] scheduled to begin Monday will help ease tensions between the NLD and the government.

AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iw6HjhrJOWOPqI0EnEOceXtBQF5AD92JAKHO0">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In July, 14 members of the NLD were <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1415053.php/Myanmar_sues_14_opposition_members_for_birthday_protest">charged</a> [DPA report] with causing political unrest by staging a protest outside NLD headquarters where they shouted slogans calling for the release of NLD party leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=aung+san+suu+kyi">news archive</a>].

Lukashenko has recently sought to improve his country&#39;s ties with western nations, but the US and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Belarus pending the release of all political prisoners, including Kozulin.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Chadian dictator <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">Hissene Habre</a> [HRW materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>] and eleven other rebel commanders were sentenced to death Friday in a Chadian court for crimes against the state after a mass trial in which dozens were tried. Habre is currently living in Senegal where he is to be eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">tried</a> [JURIST report] on charges for murder and torture. The court, lead by Judge Ngarhondo Dgide, issued no warrants for the defendants and they mounted no legal defense during the hearings. Among those sentenced were <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Mahamat-Nouri">Mahamat Nouri</a> [Nationmaster profile], Habre&#39;s defense minister, and Timane Erdimi, the cousin of current <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7224008.stm">Chadian President Idriss Deby</a> [BBC profile]. Both Erdimi and Habre&#39;s lawyer said they had heard nothing official about the proceedings. At the same trial 32 others were sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison with hard labor for attempting to &quot;overturn constitutional order&quot;. The <em>International Herald Tribune</em> has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/15/africa/chad.php">more</a>. Al-Jazeera has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2008/08/2008815165956168950.html">additional coverage</a>. <br /><br />Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. Senegal courts have <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite the issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] by Belgium pursuant to its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure to either try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to try him in Senegal and the Senegalese government later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-chad-president-facing-crimes-trial.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. Previously the Senegalese courts <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">dismissed an action against him in 2001</a> [HRW case backgrounder], claiming that they lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere. In July this year Senegal formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment giving the nation&#39;s courts jurisdiction over Habre&#39;s trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website] on Friday heard arguments in a case challenging a proposed peace agreement between the country&#39;s government and rebels from the <a href="http://www.luwaran.com/">Moro Islamic Liberation Front</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3003809.stm">backgrounder</a>].  The proposal would grant expanded boundaries to the country&#39;s southern <a href="http://www.armm.gov.ph/index.php?section=1">Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao</a> (ARMM) [official website], but opponents, including Mindanao Christians, say that the pact violates the country&#39;s constitution.  The Supreme Court has not said whether it will address the constitutionality of the agreement or whether it might order a constitutional amendment to designate the ARMM expansion as a separate state.  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080815/D92IOCSO1.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, a Supreme Court judge <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/183591-183752.pdf">enjoined</a> [ruling, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/philippines-high-court-blocks-signing.php">report</a>] government agents from signing the peace agreement.

The court last week agreed with motions by two southern provincial governments for the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the signing.  Shortly after the deal was reached, President <a href="http://www.op.gov.ph/">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website] urged the country&#39;s lawmakers to push for long-term resolution in the region in her annual <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/sonatext2008.asp">State of the Nation Address</a> (SONA) [text; government <a href="http://www.gov.ph/sona/">materials</a>].

The six are said to have physically assaulted at least two detainees whom they were guarding, and locked eight others in a cell that had been covered with pepper spray.  Seven other sailors reportedly faced non-judicial punishment for their involvement in the incidents.  Al Jazeera has <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2008/08/20088150425646611.html">more</a>.  CNN has <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/08/14/iraq.bucca/">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Camp Bucca was at the center of controversy in 2003 when the so-called <a href="http://www.npr.org/iraq/2004/prison_abuse_report.pdf">Taguba report</a> [PDF text] detailed instances of detainee abuse and found that the detention camp was well over its carrying capacity.  Many former <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees were transferred to Camp Bucca after reports of detainee abuse in the Baghdad prison surfaced.  In July, four former Abu Ghraib detainees <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-files-four-new-abu-ghraib-torture-lawsuits-targeting-military-contractor">filed lawsuits</a> [CCR materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ex-abu-ghraib-detainees-sue-military.php">report</a>] against two private US military contractors and three of their employees, alleging torture, war crimes and civil conspiracy. The former detainees said that employees of <a href="http://www.caci.com/">CACI International</a> and <a href="http://www.l-3com.com/">L-3 Communications</a> [corporate websites], which performed interrogation and interpretation work for the US military, violated the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Geneva Convention</a>, the <a href="http://www.army.mil/fm1/">Army Field Manual</a> [texts] and US law by torturing and conspiring to torture the detainees.  They also alleged that CACI and L-3 were negligent in failing to prevent the torture.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US Appeals Court for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-50737-CV0.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that anti-Castro militant <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Carriles">Luis Posada Carriles</a> [JURIST news archive; <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/opinions/cases/posadacarriles/default.asp">case materials</a>] will stand trial in the US for alleged immigration violations,  effectively blocking extradition efforts by Cuba and Venezuela.  Both countries say that the US is bound by international treaties, including the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/terrorism.htm">International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings</a> and the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/terrorism_convention_civil_aviation.html">Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation</a> [texts], to hand over Carriles, but the US has so far refused to do so.  Carriles, a Venezuelan-born Cuban citizen, is wanted in both Cuba and Venezuela on terrorism charges relating to the <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19761006-0">1976 bombing of a Cuban airplane</a> [Aviation Safety Network backgrounder].  The <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-posada15-2008aug15,0,4338154.story?track=rss">more</a>.<br /><br />Carriles was <A src="/paperchase/2005/05/cuban-bombing-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested in 2005</A> for illegally entering the US and had been under the custody of immigration officials until his <A src="/paperchase/2007/04/anti-castro-militant-released-from-us.php">release on bail</A> [JURIST reports] in April 2007. Cuba <A src="/paperchase/2007/05/cuba-says-us-release-of-anti-castro.php">criticized Carriles&#39; release</A>, and accused the US of violating international anti-terrorism treaties by freeing him and <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/court-dismisses-indictment-against-anti.php">dismissing charges</a> [JURIST reports] against him. Also in April 2007, Venezuela announced <A src="/paperchase/2007/04/venezuela-to-press-us-on-anti-castro.php">plans to challenge the US</A> [JURIST report] before the <A HREF="http://www.oas.org/">Organization of American States</A> (OAS) [official website] and other international bodies for refusing to prosecute or extradite Carriles for the terrorist bombing. The US government has cited the <A HREF="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">UN Convention Against Torture</A> [text] as justification for <A src="/paperchase/2005/09/us-judge-prevents-deportation-of-cuban.php">denying Cuban and Venezuelan requests</A> [JURIST report] to extradite Carriles, asserting that Carriles could face torture in those countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military judge on Thursday ordered that <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=military+commission">military commissions</a> [JURIST news archive] legal advisor <a href="http://www.af.mil/bios/bio.asp?bioID=10078">Gen.

The judge, Army Col. Steve Henley, held that Hartmann had made public statements <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-guantanamo-military-prosecutor.php">suggesting he was overly favorable to prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] despite the purported neutrality of his role.  Former Guantanamo prosecutor <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2006/d20060111Davis.pdf">Col. Morris D. Davis</a> [official profile, PDF] testified that Hartmann has pressed prosecutors to bring charges against Jawad, believing that the trial would excite the American public.  Jawad&#39;s lawyers sought to have charges against him dismissed due to alleged misconduct by Hartmann, but the judge denied their motion.  AP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//ap/20080814/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/guantanamo_military_trials_6">more</a>.<br /><br />Hartmann has previously been accused of bias towards prosecutors. At a Wednesday hearing, US Army <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/leadership/zanettibio.html">Gen. Gregory Zanetti</a> [official profile], deputy commander at Guantanamo Bay, <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/military-commissions-advisor-too.php">testified</a>   [JURIST report] that Hartmann routinely bullied his counterparts and was inappropriately aggressive in seeking indictments against detainees.  In May, lawyers for detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid">news archive</a>] unsuccessfully moved to have charges against their client dropped because of <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-defense-lawyers.php">similar allegations</a> [JURIST report] against Hartman.  Earlier that month, Hartman was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/top-pentagon-legal-adviser-disqualified.php">disqualified</a> [JURIST report] from participating in the military commission trial of detainee <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsHamdan.html">Salim Ahmed Hamdan</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hamdan">news archive</a>], but he has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/legal-advisor-staying-after-guantanamo.php">refused to resign</a> [JURIST report] from his post.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/index.htm">United Nations Committee on Human Rights</a> [official website] has criticized British libel laws for stifling freedom of speech, according to Thursday media reports.  In a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/hrcs93.htm">report</a> [text linked under &quot;Concluding Observations&quot;] issued after its 93rd session in Geneva, the Committee said restrictive laws may encourage media agencies and scholars to abandon reporting on serious public issues, especially in cases involving the Internet.  The report also expressed concern that the laws encourage the phenomenon know as &quot;libel tourism,&quot; where petitioners use the <a href="http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/">London High Court</a> [official website] to sue foreign publishers under laws that are seen as friendly to the claimant.  The Committee said:<blockquote>The State party should re-examine its technical doctrines of libel law, and consider the utility of a so-called &quot;public figure&quot; exception, requiring proof by the plaintiff of actual malice in order to go forward on actions concerning reporting on public officials and prominent public figures, as well as limiting the requirement that defendants reimburse a plaintiff&#39;s lawyers fees and costs regardless of scale, including Conditional Fee Agreements and so-called &quot;success fees,&quot; especially insofar as these may have forced defendant publications to settle without airing valid defences.  The ability to resolve cases through enhanced pleading requirements (e.g., requiring a plaintiff to make some preliminary showing of falsity and absence of ordinary journalistic standards) might also be considered.</blockquote>The Committee also expressed concern that the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1989/ukpga_19890006_en_1">Official Secrets Act 1989</a> [text] has been used to prevent former government officials from bringing issues of public interest to light.  The <em>Telegraph</em> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2556244/British-libel-laws-stifle-free-speech-claims-UN.html">more</a>.  The <I>Guardian</em> has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/14/law.unitednations?gusrc=rss&feed=uknews">additional coverage</a>. <br /><br />Experts first raised concerns after <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/JKTG.html">Khalid bin Mahfouz</a> [<em>Forbes</em> profile], a Saudi businessman, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jul/20/battling-censorship/">used UK courts</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] to sue Dr. Rachel Ehrenfield, the director of <a href="http://www.acdemocracy.org/index.php">The American Center for Democracy</a> [advocacy website], for defamation.  Ehrenfield had accused Mahfouz of funding terrorism in her book &quot;Funding Evil.&quot;  Mahfouz won a judgment in 2005 for more than $225,000 after the court granted jurisdiction based upon 23 copies of the book being sold in the UK along with one chapter of the book that was available over the Internet.  In July, a judge for the High Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/uk-court-grants-libel-damages-for.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a British man to pay approximately $44,000 in damages for creating a fake profile on social networking website <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?factsheet">Facebook</a> [corporate website] and posting defaming information about an acquaintance, Mathew Firsht.  Also in 2005, film director Roman Polanski was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/film-director-allowed-to-sue-in-uk-via.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] to pursue a libel suit via video tape against <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2F&ei=m82kSLL1AajWeraXqR4&usg=AFQjCNGzxSWYVi3Sf9j8S8wax4Z2ZqcVlg&sig2=hrjN1CTc-ofqjzN3U1kzGg">Vanity Fair</a> [media website] despite his status as a fugitive at the time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTAzMTktY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-0319-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irlce27/11/hilite">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [opinion, PDF] brought by survivors of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> against the nation of <a href="/countries/saudi.php">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST news archives] and four of its princes, ruling that the defendants were protected from prosecution under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> [text].  The plaintiffs accused the princes of donating money to anti-American charities, which then funneled the funds to al-Qaeda:<blockquote>The plaintiffs ask the Court to draw a &#8220;reasonable inference&#8221; that because of sharia, there exists &#8220;an active, not passive, relationship among an Islamic bank, its owners, and its large depositors.&#8221; In other words, the owners of [Swiss bank] DMI and its subsidiaries &#8220;are close business partners with bank &#8216;customers&#8217; in a partnership or collaboration to manage and invest customers&#8217; capital in a mutually beneficial way.&#8221; Osama bin Laden, his bodyguard, and other al Qaeda operatives had deposits with DMI and its subsidiaries. (Also, bin Laden himself invested $50 million in one of DMI&#8217;s subsidiaries.) Therefore, argue the plaintiffs, the September 11 attacks &#8220;were a direct result of the material support that Prince Mohamed . . . provided al Qaeda.&#8221; Mohamed disputes this characterization of sharia banking; but even assuming its accuracy, it does not reflect that Mohamed engaged in &#8220;intentional&#8221; conduct &#8220;expressly aimed at the United States.</blockquote>The court held that for the lawsuit to proceed it was not enough to show that the princes knew that the money would be used for al-Qaeda attacks. Instead, plaintiffs would have to show that the princes intended for the money to be used for that purpose.  AP has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-14-saudi-liability_N.htm?csp=15">more</a>.  AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gXvbvsJ9pE_aAJCS6tJrk78MWjvg">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />This is not the first time that US courts have rejected 9/11 litigation against Saudi Arabia.  In 2005, US District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Richard Casey <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03MDL1570_RCC_011905.PDF">dismissed</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">report</a>] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [LII backgrounder].  The plaintiffs in that case were suing over 200 defendants who allegedly helped fund and support Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda.  Casey allowed a claim to proceed against the <a href="http://www.sbg.com.sa/">Saudi Binladen Group</a> [corporate website], the successor to a construction company founded by bin Laden&#39;s father, because additional discovery is necessary to determine whether the company &quot;purposefully directed its activities at the United States.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/14/georgi19625.htm">announced</a> [press release] on Friday that its researchers have proof that Russian forces have <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080815/D92IKPI03.html">dropped cluster bombs on Georgian civilians</a> [AP report] during the recent conflict over the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7554507.stm">breakaway region of South Ossetia</a> [BBC report]. Cluster bombs release large numbers of smaller explosives which spread out before detonating upon impact, a design meant to maximize bodily injury of a large group of people. On Tuesday, Georgia <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14657.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14659.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] against Russia with the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?p1=0">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], alleging that invading Russian troops have also engaged in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">murder, rape and mass displacement of civilians</a> [JURIST report].  Russian officials have stated that they have their own evidence showing that Georgian forces have committed war crimes. <br /><br />At the <a href="http://www.clustermunitionsdublin.ie/">Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions</a> [official website] in May, diplomats agreed on a <a href="http://www.clustermunitionsdublin.ie/pdf/SecretariatsBlankRollingText28MayRev1_000.pdf">draft treaty</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nations-agree-on-cluster-bomb-draft.php">report</a>] banning the use, manufacture, and stockpiling of <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/section-ihl-cluster-munition?open?compaign=cluster-munition">cluster munitions</a> [ICRC materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cluster+bombs">news archive</a>]. No representatives were sent to the conference from the US, China, Russia, Israel, India, or Pakistan, whose governments collectively make up the world&#39;s largest producers and users of cluster bombs. A <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/05/28/usint18960.htm">loophole</a> [HRW press release] allows continued military and other cooperation between parties and non-parties to the treaty, which must still be ratified by individual signatory nations before entering into full effect.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Supreme Court of Thailand ruled on Friday that former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and his wife <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">news archive</a>] will be <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080815/D92IJ3S81.html">tried <em>in absentia</em> on corruption charges</a> [AP report].  The couple are in the UK, where last week they announced their <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-high-court-issues-arrest.php">refusal to return to Thailand</a> due to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-officials-deny-thaksin.php">alleged judicial bias</a> [JURIST reports]. The Supreme Court <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129527">issued warrants for their arrest</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] when they failed to make a court appearance. The Thai government is reportedly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aLW48ApiqMnc&refer=asia">seeking their extradition</a> [Bloomberg report] from the UK. <br /><br />Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Thaksin&#39;s challenge that the commission bringing charges against him is governed by a statute which violates the right to individual liberty. Last month, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution reducing fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. In April, Pojamarn <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/thailand-ex-pm-returning-in-may-to-face.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] stemming from a 2003 agreement with the government-directed <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website] to purchase land said to be worth three times more than the $26 million she paid for it. Lawyers for Thaksin <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawyer-for-ex-thailand-pm-jailed-for.php">have been jailed</a> [JURIST report] for attempting to bribe court officials in one of Thaksin&#39;s cases, and current Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile] is <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-opposition-seeks-impeachment.php">facing possible impeachment proceedings</a> [JURIST report] due in part to his party&#39;s close association with Thaksin.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/">Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [official website] on Monday called on Russia to take action against growing instances of ethnic violence and Neo-Nazi activity within its borders.  CERD said that Chechens, Roma, and other ethnic and religious minorities are the most common victims and noted allegations that Russian police frequently refuse to intervene to stop such attacks.  The panel also urged Russia to investigate reports that in 2006 officials forcibly deported ethnic Georgians living in Russia. Georgia has said that the incident reflected official state policy at the time and last week <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14657.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">report</a> ] with the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?p1=0">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website].  Monday&#39;s comments are related to CERD&#39;s <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/cerds73.htm">scheduled review</a> [UN materials] of Russia&#39;s compliance with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [text].  Reuters has <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/reuters/international_russia_racism_dc">more</a>.<br /><br />This is not the first time that Russia has been criticized for racist attacks.  A January <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/russia-hate-crimes-up-13-percent-in.php">report</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://xeno.sova-center.ru/6BA2468">SOVA Center</a> [advocacy website] rights group found that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hate+crime">hate crimes</a> [JURIST news archive] in Russia rose 13 percent in 2007, but also found that police have done little to stop attacks.  In June 2007, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/hate-crimes-on-rise-in-europe-rights.php">hate crimes are on the rise throughout all of Europe</a> [JURIST report], after conducting a study examining recent hate crimes in France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. That study found that Russia has a &quot;proliferation of violent hate crimes directed against ethnic, religious and national minorities.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Jury selection began Tuesday in the the trial of a former US Marine who faces <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ex-marine-charged-with-voluntary.php">voluntary manslaughter charges</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] for alleged involvement in the deaths of four Iraqi civilians in 2004. Sergeant Jose Nazario cannot face trial by court-martial because he is no longer in the military, and is therefore being tried under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_212.html">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000</a> [text], which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civilians who allegedly committed crimes abroad while still associated with the US military. Some have criticized the government&#39;s use of the law against Nazario, arguing that it was designed to prosecute government contractors, but others cite specific language in the Act as evidence that it was also intended to include retired military personnel: <blockquote>An Act...to establish Federal jurisdiction over offenses committed outside the United States by persons employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces, or by members of the Armed Forces who are released or separated from active duty prior to being identified and prosecuted for the commission of such offenses, and for other purposes.</blockquote>The trial is being held by the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a>&nbsp;[official website] and Nazario faces more than 10 years in prison in convicted.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7571512.stm">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">San Diego Union-Tribune</font> has <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/military/20080820-9999-1n20trial.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In March, US Marine Sgt. Ryan Weemer was <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/lapa/Iraq/Fallujah/Fallujah-Rel-08-001-080318.htm">charged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/us-marine-charged-with-murder-in.php">report</a>] with one count of murder and one count of dereliction of duty, and in December&nbsp;Marine Sgt. Jermaine A. Nelson was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-marine-sergeant-re-charged-with.php">charged</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] with murder and dereliction of duty&nbsp;charges in connection to the same incident as Nazario. &nbsp;Both of those men face court-martial as active members of the military.&nbsp;In March 2007, a US military court-martial found 101st Airborne Staff Sgt. Raymond Girouard guilty of <a href="http://euphoricreality.com/wp-content/uploads/IronTriangleArt32Transcript.doc">three counts of negligent homicide</a> [Article 32 hearing transcript, DOC], but not guilty of premeditated murder for the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thar+OR+samarra">deaths of three Iraqi detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] held after a May 2006 raid in Thar Thar, a town near Samarra in the northern Salahuddin province of Iraq. In January 2007 US Army Specialist William Hunsaker received an 18-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/four-soldiers-charged-with-murdering.php">murder, attempted murder and obstruction of justice charges</a> [JURIST report] related to the same incident as Girouard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/04-1243-1133914.pdf">vacated</a> [decision, PDF] a 2006 <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/E6-21335.pdf">rule</a> [Federal Register notice] prohibiting state and local governments from monitoring air pollution below acceptable levels set by the EPA for &quot;stationary&quot; sources such as power plants and factories. The court wrote that the rule violated <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85_20_V.html">Title V of the Clean Air Act</a> [text] because the EPA&#39;s monitoring protocols themselves violated the Act, and because the rule prevented state and local governments from making up for its shortcomings.  In the decision, the court posed the question facing local governments obligated to issue permits to the facilities:<blockquote>... how should a permitting authority respond to an emission standard that has a periodic monitoring requirement inadequate to the task of assuring compliance? For example, suppose there is a standard that limits emission from a given stationary source to X units of pollutant per day. Suppose also that the standard requires annual monitoring. Where annual testing cannot assure compliance with a daily emission limit, may the permitting authority supplement the monitoring requirement &#8220;to assure compliance with the permit terms and conditions,&#8221; as the Act commands?</blockquote>The EPA had argued that it had the discretion to decide what measures were or were not adequate under the Act, but the court disagreed:<blockquote>Title V is a complex statute with a clear objective: it enlists EPA and state and local environmental authorities in a common effort to create a permit program for most stationary sources of air pollution. Fundamental to this scheme is the mandate that &#8220;[e]ach permit . . . shall set forth . . . monitoring . . . requirements to assure compliance with the permit terms and conditions.&#8221; By its terms, this mandate means that a monitoring requirement insufficient &#8220;to assure compliance&#8221; with emission limits has no place in a permit unless and until it is supplemented by more rigorous standards. [citations omitted]</blockquote> AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jgZL8IDndD46O9BgMF1hi8SgR0KgD92LKFEO0">more</a>.<br /><br />The EPA has recently faced increasing conflict with states seeking tighter pollution controls. In July, California Attorney General <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website] formally <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1594_final_180_day_notice.pdf">notified</a> [letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/california-threatens-to-sue-epa-over.php">report</a>]&nbsp;the EPA that the state would file a lawsuit against the agency if it refused to issue rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles as well as industrial and agricultural machinery. In January, California&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/01/california-sues-epa-over-auto-emissions.php">filed suit</a>&nbsp;to appeal the EPA&#39;s previous&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2007/12/epa-denies-waiver-for-california-auto.php">denial of a request for a waiver</a> [JURIST reports] that would have allowed California and 16 other states to impose stricter greenhouse gas emissions standards on cars and light trucks. &nbsp;In May, a report by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that the White House had <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/white-house-influenced-epa-in-emission.php">influenced that decision</a>&nbsp;and the administration later&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/white-house-claims-executive-privilege.php">refused to turn over requested documents</a> [JURIST reports] concerning the decision to the committee, citing executive privilege.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/322CE42BE43DDBB7882574AA00020021/$file/0755469.pdf?openelement">upheld</a> [opinion; PDF] a California public school district&#39;s policy that parents may only observe their disabled children in the classroom for twenty minutes in order to evaluate the school&#39;s proposed education plan.  The parents of a student (L.M.) with <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer">autism</a> [advocacy site] filed suit after the psychologist they hired to evaluate the proposed plan was allowed only twenty minutes in the classroom, even though the district&#39;s own experts viewed L.M. in his home for three hours.  The court rejected the parents&#39; allegations that the district&#39;s policy violated the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:h.1350.enr:">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (IDEA) [text] by denying their child access to a free and appropriate public education.  The court also ruled against the parents&#39; argument that the policy infringed upon their right to due process by interfering with their ability to participate in a placement hearing.  The court explained:<blockquote>The District&#8217;s policy...was harmless because Parents nevertheless had a full opportunity to participate in the process to fashion an appropriate educational plan for L.M. with help from an informed and knowledgeable expert. There is no evidence to support a finding that Parents&#8217; right to participate was significantly affected.</blockquote>  The court also denied the parents&#39; request for a &quot;stay put&quot; order which would allow their child to remain in his current private educational program until litigation of the matter concluded, because the program did not constitute &quot;current educational placement&quot; under IDEA.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ck10.uscourts.gov%2F&ei=X6KbSMzUGqHAese9tIcF&usg=AFQjCNEjVRT2YGEYSNEUIf6w6q5L_AsMaw&sig2=0Al_SQXJu7zXJXdLXpOiHQ">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/07/07-2133.pdf">found that a district court erred</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/tenth-circuit-dismisses-claim-school.php">report</a>] when it refused to grant qualified immunity to school officials who placed a child in a special education program designed to control his repeated outbursts.  The child&#39;s mother had originally sought relief under IDEA because her child suffered from severe mental and emotional health problems, but this claim was dismissed by a lower court.  In 2007, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/supreme-court-rules-in-telecom.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that parents of special needs children have independent, enforceable rights under IDEA, overturning a Sixth Circuit decision holding that rights under IDEA are held only by the child. When US President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/bush-signs-disabilities-education-bill.php">signed IDEA into law</a> [JURIST report] in 2004, he stated that it had been designed to ensure that students with disabilities would have special education teachers with the necessary skills and training.  Bush was subsequently criticized for underfunding the related programs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/94C7D1D7A0AA4DB9882574A900597DAB/$file/0616727.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Monday that those placed on the government&#39;s &quot;no-fly list&quot; can challenge their inclusion on the list in federal district courts. The issue came before the court in a case brought by a woman on the list, in which a district court had ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00046110----000-.html">law</a> [statute text] exempting <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] orders from federal trial court review.  Reversing the decision, the Ninth Circuit held that the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/counterrorism/mission.htm">Terrorist Screening Center</a>&nbsp;[official website] which actually maintains the list is a subsection of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and is therefore subject to review by the district courts:  <blockquote>Our interpretation of section 46110 is consistent not merely with the statutory language but with common sense as well. Just how would an appellate court review the agency&#8217;s decision to put a particular name on the list? There was no hearing before an administrative law judge; there was no notice-and comment procedure. For all we know, there is no administrative record of any sort for us to review. So if any court is going to review the government&#8217;s decision to put Ibrahim&#8217;s name on the No-Fly List, it makes sense that it be a court with the ability to take evidence.[citations omitted]</blockquote>The court also held that the woman could not bring two related claims because they were &#8220;inescapably intertwined&#8221; with TSA orders.  The <font style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</font> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/19/BA2212DEQU.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea">more</a>.<br /><br />In July, the US&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/terrorinfo/counterrorism/faqs.htm">terror watchlist</a>&nbsp;[FBI FAQ], which includes the no-fly list, was&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-terrorist-watchlist-needs-tighter.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] for being&nbsp;too large, containing inaccuracies, and lacking safeguards to prevent the unnecessary targeting of passengers for additional security screenings. In March, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/plus/a0816/final.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] saying that FBI had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/fbi-submitted-inaccurate-data-to.php">submitted inaccurate information to the list</a> [JURIST report], that the information was rarely reviewed before its submission, and even if discrepancies become apparent they were often left unchanged. In response to the audit, FBI Assistant Director John Miller said that the agency was <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/watchlist031708.htm">working with the DOJ and other partner agencies</a> [press release] to &quot;ensure the proper balance between national security protection and the need for accurate, efficient, and streamlined watchlist processes.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] has moved to replace the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/order-e/080730c.pdf">judges</a> [order designating judges, PDF] at his upcoming war crimes trial before the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], according to documents released on Tuesday.  Karadzic argues that presiding <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1420477.php/PROFILE_Alphons_Orie_the_pragmatic_Dutch_judge_whom_Karadzic_faces">Judge Alphons Orie</a> [DPA profile] is biased against him because he has overseen ICTY cases brought against various other former Bosnian Serb leaders and would want to maintain their line of reasoning.  As an example of these past cases, he cited the prosecution of former Bosnian Serb parliamentary leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/krajisnik.htm">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/krajisnik/trialc/judgement/kra-jud060927e.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">report</a>] to 27 years&#39; imprisonment in 2006 for various war crimes committed during the Bosnian war.  Karadzic has asked for the removal of the other judges assigned to his case for similar reasons.  Reuters has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//nm/20080819/wl_nm/warcrimes_karadzic_judges_dc_1">more</a>.<br /><br />Karadzic, who has been <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">indicted</a> [text] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> leaders <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/">Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) and <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official websites] sent a <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/issues/Judiciary/081808MukaseyReGuidelines.pdf">letter</a> [PDF text; <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200808/081808a.html">press release</a>] to Attorney General Michael Mukasey on Monday, calling on the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) to postpone implementation of new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>&nbsp;(FBI) [official websites] guidelines until Congress has had a chance to review the changes. Opponents of the controversial guidelines <a href="http://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/racialprofiling/35921prs20080708.html">argue</a> [ACLU release] that the changes, if adopted, could allow for inappropriate profiling and would allow agents to open terror investigations without evidence of any crime being committed.  The senators wrote that Congress should be consulted because of the change in protocol regarding <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/documents/guidance_on_race.htm">racial profiling</a> [guidelines] in FBI&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/fbiundercover.pdf">investigations</a> [PDF backgrounder]: <blockquote>The guidelines... reflect a laudatory effort to ensure that front-line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations.  Nevertheless, efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns, given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters...<br /><br />The important aims of the guidelines, and their potential implications for civil liberties, require a meaningful dialogue between Congress and DOJ.  Notwithstanding the work of our staff, Congressional consultation is difficult during the recess period.  Moreover, these issues are sufficiently important to merit a public hearing.  After all, although prior consultation on such guidelines is not mandatory, the level of public and Congressional confidence in the guidelines will inform later legislation and oversight activities.</blockquote>The letter stressed that the guidelines should not be adopted until after FBI Director Mueller testifies before the committee in September. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080818/D92L06S01.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Mukasey <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/mukasey-defends-fbi-and-doj-procedures.php">defended the proposed&nbsp;guidelines</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] before the committee in July, saying they would take into account not only race or religion but also factors such as&nbsp;travel to foreign terror &quot;hot spots.&quot; Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website] spoke out against the plan, calling it <a href="http://www.cair.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?ArticleID=25092&&name=n&&currPage=1&&Active=1">&quot;unconstitutional and un-American&quot;</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/fbi-terrorism-profiling-proposal-un.php">report</a>] and saying that it could allow security agents to target Muslims and Arab-Americans for harassment.

The memorandum covers EULEX&#39;s duties regarding judicial, policing and other operations.  Serbia, which has vehemently opposed independence for Kosovo, <a href="http://www.srbija.sr.gov.yu/vesti/vest.php?id=47969">denounced the deal as a violation of international law</a> [press release].  Russian officials said the nation would <a href="http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/12426/">lodge a complaint</a> [<em>Balkan Insight</em> report] with the UN to challenge EULEX&#39;s legality.  EULEX is expected to assume a limited executive role in implementing the rule of law as UNMIK nears the end of its 120-day timetable for reducing operations.  The <a href="http://www.ico-kos.org/en/">International Civilian Office</a> [official website] will oversee progress under Kosovo&#39;s status settlement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian officials on Monday confirmed that the nation will file a complaint against Georgia with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) and said that the government is considering filing another complaint with the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official websites].  The filings would be related to war crimes allegedly committed against ethnic Russians in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7554507.stm">breakaway region of South Ossetia</a> [BBC report].  Russia&#39;s <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main_eng">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] has also <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/11BDA5564A071503C32574A900229AF6">called for Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to resign</a> [press release] and be tried for war crimes before the ICC.  Last week, Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of Russia&#39;s Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, said that his staff is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-searching-for-evidence-of.php">collecting evidence</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes allegedly committed by Georgian forces in South Ossetia.  The <em>Moscow Times</em> has <a href="http://pda.moscowtimes.ru/article.php?aid=187034">more</a>.<br /><br />Last week, Georgia <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14657.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">report</a>] against Russia with the ICJ, alleging that invading Russian troops have engaged in murder, rape and mass displacement of civilians during the recent conflict between the countries.  Georgia also accused Russia of ongoing violations of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> [text] since 1990 based on its removal of ethnic Georgians from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S142892.PDF">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Monday that gay and lesbian patients cannot be denied medical treatment because of doctors&#39; religious beliefs.  The issue came before the court in a case where a lesbian couple who were denied an artificial insemination procedure by a clinic claimed the refusal violated anti-discrimination provisions in California&#39;s <a href="http://www.dfeh.ca.gov/publications/publications.aspx?showPub=36">Unruh Civil Rights Act</a> [materials, PDF]. The clinic and doctors who were the defendants in the case claimed that under both the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_1">California Declaration of Rights </a> [text] and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">US Constitution</a> [First Amendment backgrounder], their right to free exercise of religion permitted them to refuse treatment. constitutions as part of their right to&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;their religion.  Disagreeing with this interpretation, the court wrote:<blockquote>California&#8217;s Unruh Civil Rights Act, from which defendant physicians seek religious exemption, is &#8220;a valid and neutral law of general applicability.&#8221; As relevant in this case, it requires business establishments to provide &#8220;full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services&#8221; to all persons notwithstanding their sexual orientation.  Accordingly, the First Amendment&#8217;s right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the Act&#8217;s antidiscrimination requirements even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with defendants&#8217; religious beliefs. [citations omitted]</blockquote> The court went on to say that physicians could avoid the conflict by simply refusing to practice the procedure at all or by asking another physician in their clinic to conduct the procedure. AP has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-18-calif-health-care_N.htm?csp=15">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</font> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/19/BA2212D6H4.DTL">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In June, the court&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S147999.PDF">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">report</a>] which overturned a state ban on <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-same-sex-marriages-begin-as.php">took effect</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] after withstanding challenges from both in-state <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/conservative-group-petitions-california.php">conservative groups</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/new-york-to-recognize-out-of-state-same.php">out-of-state attorneys general</a> [JURIST reports] who objected to the ruling because it also allows couples from others states to be married while in California.  The ruling may still be overturned, however, as opponents have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">successfully petitioned</a> [JURIST report] to place a proposed state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages on the <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_pdfs/initiatives/i737_07-0068_Initiative.pdf">November ballot</a> [materials, PDF; proposition <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/index.php">website</a>].&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan&#39;s ruling coalition on Tuesday failed to reach an agreement on reinstating the judges who were ousted last year by President <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>].  Officials had originally projected that a plan would be established Tuesday for restoring the judges within the next few days, and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] head Nawaz Sharif has threatened to withdraw from the coalition if judges, including former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], are not returned to office within 24 hours.  The negotiations come one day after Musharraf announced that he was <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/NewsEventsDetail.aspx?NewsEventID=4101">resigning from office</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">report</a>] in order to avoid impeachment proceeding by the country&#39;s parliament.   The coalition government is also discussing who will succeed Musharraf as president, but Pakistan People&#39;s Party head <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile] has implied that the presumptive nominee will come from his party. It is not clear yet whether Musharraf will face prosecution for alleged human rights violations committed while in office.  DPA has <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.ae/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/pakistanaftermusharraf/2008/August/pakistanaftermusharraf_August37.xml&section=pakistanaftermusharraf">more</a>.  The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/world/asia/20pstan.html?hp">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the coalition government said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">push to impeach Musharraf</a> because had given a &quot;clear commitment&quot; to step down from office after his party was defeated in <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-pakistan-parliament-could-reinstate.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST reports], but subsequently refused to resign or go into exile, and because be had failed to follow through on a promise to ask parliament for a confidence vote.  In June, the PML-N <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of Peru on Monday instituted a <a href="http://www.peruviantimes.com/president-garcia-declares-30-day-state-of-emergency-to-quell-indigenous-protests-in-amazon/">state of emergency</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Peruvian Times</span> report] in the northern region of the country, banning public gatherings, limiting travel, and increasing police presence for 30 days.  The measure comes in response to large protests held by indigenous groups who oppose a new law reducing the majority by which a tribe must agree to sell communal land to oil and natural gas companies.  Government officials said that the actions <a href="http://www.andina.com.pe/Espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=w5xpV8B+hRg=">were necessary</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Andina</span> report, in Spanish] to protect the power generation stations which were the focus of the occasionally-violent protests, but an <a href="http://www.aidesep.org.pe/">advocacy group for the Amazon natives</a> [AIDESEP website] has <a href="http://www.aidesep.org.pe/index.php?codnota=203">defended their right to protest</a> [press release] what they say is an encroachment on their decision making process.  Earlier this month, the UN held a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/un-celebrates-adopting-declaration-on.php">celebration</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.un.org/events/indigenous/2008/index.shtml">International Day of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples</a> [official website], where UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon <a href="http://www.un.org/events/indigenous/2008/sgmessage.shtml">expressed the UN&#39;s dedication</a> [statement] to ending the &quot;expropriation of [indigenous peoples&#39;] traditional lands.&quot;  AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080819/D92L5T6G0.html">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7569851.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The controversial new law is part of a trade agreement negotiated during the administration of US President George W. Bush, who has tried to make it easier for energy companies to acquire land from US trading partners.  Bush has made several other recent policy changes in an effort to increase the country&#39;s oil supply. In July, he issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080714-2.html">memorandum</a> [presidential statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-lifts-executive-order-banning.php">report</a>] lifting an executive ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=offshore+drilling">offshore oil drilling</a> [JURIST news archive] which had been put in place in 1990 by his father, then-President George H. W. Bush. In June, Bush called on Congress, which is still preventing offshore drilling,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html">to relax restrictions on oil exploration</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/president-bush-urges-congress-to-allow.php">report</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Sudanese court on Monday sentenced eight Darfur rebels to death, including the half brother of <a href="http://www.sudanjem.com/en/index.php">Justice and Equality Movement</a> (JEM) [organization website] leader Khalil Ibrahim.  Abdul Aziz Ashur and others were found guilty on charges related to a May rebel attack on the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, in which at least 200 people died.  In June, Sudanese security forces <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/05/13/sudan18812.htm">arrested more than 100 JEM members</a> [HRW press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/darfur-rebels-to-face-terror-charges.php">report</a>] in connection with the attack.  Later that month, 39 accused <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive] rebels <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/darfur-rebels-to-face-terror-charges.php">appeared</a>  [JURIST report] before special courts to be tried under a 2001 anti-terrorism law.  News.com has <a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24197964-1702,00.html?from=public_rss">more</a>.<br /><br />Sudanese officials <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/06/18/africa/AF-GEN-Sudan-Darfur.php">accuse</a> [AP report] JEM members of terrorism, rebellion and conspiring against the constitution.  In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2008/darfur0608/darfur0608web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; HRW <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/06/17/sudan19149.htm">press release</a>] detailing detainee abuse in the wake of the May 10 rebel attack. The report called on the Sudanese government to identify the prisoners detained in connection with the attack, and to release any detainees who have no connection to rebel activities. Since civil war broke out in the Darfur region in 2003, over 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced. Reports by the UNHCHR and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee for the Red Cross</a> [official website] have documented numerous violations of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-rights-body-calls-for-immediate.php">human rights</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/all-sides-violating-human-rights-in.php">international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST reports] based on interviews with refugees, rebel groups, and agencies and authorities working in the region.

Moreno-Ocampo has already received sharp&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;from both the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> (LAS) and the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official websites] for his decision to seek the&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">arrest</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report]&nbsp;of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  These international bodies assert that the indictment of a sitting head of state would set a dangerous and destabilizing precedent. New concerns reported Monday focus on Moreno-Ocampo&#39;s alleged employment misconduct and aggressive prosecutorial methods. &nbsp;Critics reportedly believe the behavior could threaten the credibility of the court. Also Monday, al-Bashir appeared at an <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iQhv2Dq-WE45MhVC-tQEugZdaFFAD92KQ3FO0">African economic conference held in Turkey</a> [AP report], and some rights groups called on Turkey to support the ICC.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">criticized</a> the Sudanese&nbsp;government&#39;s attempt&nbsp;to&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;its own <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">probe</a> [JURIST reports] into Darfur human rights violations.  Sudan could potentially remove war crimes suspects like al-Bashir from the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction if its&nbsp;domestic courts employ safeguards to ensure accountability and respect for human rights, as outlined in Article 16 of the ICC&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/about/officialjournal/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a>&nbsp;[PDF text].&nbsp;The UN Security Council has repeatedly asked Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">comply with the investigation of al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report], but Sudan has refused to do so, calling Moreno-Ocampo&nbsp;a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-ambassador-says-icc-prosecutor.php">terrorist</a>&quot; [JURIST report] and suggesting that he should be removed from office. Before al-Bashir&#39;s indictment the Sudanese government had already rejected the ICC&#39;s jurisdiction and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-president-refuses-to-turn-over.php">refused to surrender two previously-named war crimes suspects</a> [JURIST report].

Scott, who is also the chief justice of the <a href="http://www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/ca/ca_judges.html">Manitoba Court of Appeal</a> [official website], said that by straying too far from their normal duties as judges, members of the judiciary risked the appearance of being seen as partisan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.yemenparliament.com/">Yemeni Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Monday voted against a bill which would have amended the country&#39;s electoral laws by restricting government officials from influencing the ballot.  The bill would also have required electors to register in either their place of birth or residence rather than their place of work.  Yemen&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.gpc.org.ye/">General People&#39;s Congress</a> (GPC) [party website] voted against the bill, while members of the main opposition party, <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Yemeni-Socialist-Party">Yemen Socialist Party</a> (YSP) [Nationmaster backgrounder], boycotted Monday&#39;s vote as they pushed <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php?lng=en">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in English] to release fellow party members detained since clashes with police in April.  Eight senior YSP officials are currently being tried on charges of incitement and secession.  AFP has <a href="http://www.france24.com/20080818-yemen-parliament-rejects-electoral-law-changes">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, <a href="http://www.metimes.com/Politics/2008/07/22/five_wounded_in_yemen_protest_witnesses/afp/">demonstrations by students and southern Yemenis</a> [AFP report] against alleged northern bias in government jobs turned violent as at least one man killed was killed in confrontations with police.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A bill introduced in the Malaysian parliament on Monday would require all criminal suspects to submit DNA samples, a measure that has been tied to to the ongoing investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">sodomy charges</a> [JURIST report] against opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>] since the government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-government-pushes-dna.php">promised to table it last month</a> [JURIST report].   Also on Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister <a href="http://www3.pmo.gov.my/">Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi</a> [official website] said that Anwar should decide whether to deny the allegations by swearing an oath, since on Friday the former aide accusing Anwar of sodomy swore on the Koran that his accusations were true.  Earlier this month, Anwar pleaded not guilty to the charge of sodomy, which in Malaysia is punishable by 20 years in prison, regardless of consent. Anwar has said the accusations are part of a government campaign to upset his plans to run in an August 26 by-election, and he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST report] in late June.   AP has <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/18/asia/AS-Malaysia-Anwar.php">more</a>.  <em>The Star</em> has <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/18/nation/22111952&sec=nation">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Malaysian authorities briefly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> Anwar last month, less than a day after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-authorities-issue-arrest.php">warrant was issued for his arrest</a> [JURIST reports].  Last week, Anwar released a <a href="http://www.m2day.org/fpdf/rep.pdf">medical report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-releases.php">report</a>] that he said refuted the sodomy allegations.  Anwar was Malaysia&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">former Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He only recently reentered Malaysian politics following the expiration of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. Last month the Federal Court of Malaysia ruled he could <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-high-court-allows-ex-deputy-pm.php">challenge the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of his original dismissal from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Senegal may drop charges against former Chadian dictator <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">Hissene Habre</a> [HRW materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced to death in absentia</a> [JURIST report] in Chad on Friday, according to Monday media reports.  Senegalese Justice Minister Madicke Niang said that Habre could not be tried twice on the same charges, although human rights activists argue that Habre&#39;s indictment in Chad for armed rebellion was different from the human rights abuse charges he faces in Senegal.  Senegal has long been criticized for allegedly delaying Habre&#39;s trial, although it recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">adopted constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] to allow for his prosecution.  BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7567646.stm">more</a>.  AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/story//afp/20080818/wl_africa_afp/senegalchadhabrejustice_080818143508">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. Senegal courts have <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite Belgium&#39;s issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] under its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure to either try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to try him in Senegal and the Senegalese government later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-chad-president-facing-crimes-trial.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. A Senegalese court <a href="http://www.hrw.org/justice/habre/">dismissed a previous action against him in 2001</a> [HRW case backgrounder], claiming that it lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere.

A court judge said the application was rejected because Khodorkovsky had disobeyed guards&#39; orders, refused to participate in a training program, and is facing 20 more years in prison if convicted on <a href="http://www.khodorkovsky.info/khodorkovsky_in_colony/136483.html">new charges</a> [press release; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aspsM5RO5Q3Y">report</a>] of theft and money laundering.

Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has always maintained his innocence and insisted that the charges against him are politically motivated, but Russian prosecutors have <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/russian-prosecutors-insist-khodorkovsky.php">denied the accusations</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Prosecutors before the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/121/2008-08-21_OCP_Statement.pdf">appealed</a> [statement, PDF] the indictment of former Khmer Rouge prison chief <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [TrialWatch profile], also known as &quot;Duch,&quot; saying it should have included additional charges. The court had issued a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/115/Closing_order_indicting_Kaing_Guek_Eav_ENG.pdf">closing order</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/cambodia-chamber-indicts-former-khmer.php">report</a>] earlier this month to officially indict Duch&nbsp;on charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the Geneva Conventions. In a <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/122/Statement_by_OCIJ_on_closing_order.pdf">statement</a> [PDF text] responding to the appeal, the court made no comment other than to say that the appeal would delay the trial, which was to be tribunal&#39;s first since it was was established in 2006. Duch, who was in charge of the notorious S-21 prison in Phnom Penh, is one of five top leaders of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khmer+rouge">Khmer Rouge regime</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">backgrounder</a>] currently in ECCC custody. AFP has <a href="http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080821/tap-cambodia-genocide-tribunal-un-court-2a5be5e.html">more</a>. The <font style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</font> has <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2008082321324/National-news/Prosecutors-appeal-Duch-indictment.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />In April, ECCC officials said that the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eccc-aiming-to-end-investigation-into.php">expected to complete its investigation</a> [JURIST report] of Duch by July.  Duch was arrested in 1999 on genocide charges and was subsequently charged with <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/ex-khmer-rouge-prison-chief-faces-new.php">war crimes</a> by a military court in March and with <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/former-khmer-rouge-leader-charged-with.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST reports] by the ECCC in July. It is thought that those charges were brought to keep Duch in custody while the ECCC began its initial operations. A panel of ECCC judges ruled late last year that Duch <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/khmer-rouge-genocide-tribunal-denies.php">should not be granted bail</a> [JURIST report] while preparations for his trial continue.

The Second Circuit affirmed the lower court&#39;s decision to order Joseph Amato and John Fasciana to pay $12.8 million in restitution, including over $3 million in lawyers&#39; fees, to their former employer, <a href="http://www.eds.com/">Electronic Data Systems</a> (EDS) [corporate website], for inflating performance figures in order to receive undeserved commissions, and otherwise embezzling money from the company. Amato and Fasciana had argued that the award of the fees was not allowed under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c104:1:./temp/~c104IGJauu:e44724:">Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996</a>&nbsp;(MVRA) [text] because the costs were not directly caused by their actions, but the court disagreed:<blockquote>...even assuming attorney fees and auditing costs must be a direct and foreseeable result of the offense -- such a requirement was clearly met here.  Defendants perpetrated a complicated fraud against a large corporation and a number of its clients, as well as the states to which those clients were required to turn over... funds.  That this fraud would force the corporation to expend large sums of money on its own internal investigation as well as its participation in the government&#39;s investigation and prosecution of defendants&#39; offenses is not surprising.  There is no doubt that EDS&#39;s attorney fees and auditing costs were a direct and foreseeable result of defendants&#39; offenses.</blockquote>In July, The US <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/07/072437P.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rules-criminal.php">report</a>] that criminal courts have no authority to direct <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/training/llw601.PDF">restitution payments</a> [backgrounder] to anyone other than a victim.  That issue came before the court in a case where the defendant was ordered to make scheduled restitution payments to a victim under the MVRA. The two had tried to make a deal reducing the amount, and a lower court had sent the remaining payments to a third party in order to settle a debt for the&nbsp;defendant.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Three of the largest brokerage firms in the US <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/aug/aug21b_08.html">reached a settlement</a> [press release] with the <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/">New York Attorney General&#39;s office</a> [official website] and securities regulators representing 48 states on Thursday, agreeing to pay $10 billion to investors who purchased auction rate securities.  The agreement is the result of an effort to settle claims that <a href="http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_15125">Merrill Lynch</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.goldmansachs.com%2F&ei=lM2uSMmaKJTyeY2LpGo&usg=AFQjCNHfiLz71ZVGjrT6EI1RkFLrtTPKrQ&sig2=ZvS2bGYLXECFnLq6aGGNTw">Goldman Sachs</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.db.com%2F&ei=wc2uSLrFL5KEet-RoJQB&usg=AFQjCNH_Y83RSoIlyC0YPpIYfGv-0Lg21A&sig2=26JZ8PIjyU6aK_CVqx0Lnw">Deutsche Bank</a> [corporate websites] had misled investors about the safety of auction rate securities during marketing and sales of the investments.  According to New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official profile], the banking firms will buy back all such securities held by retail investors, a group including all individuals, charities, non-profits, and small to medium size businesses.  Commenting on the agreement, Cuomo said:<blockquote>Today is a win for investors and a win for the market, and to date we&#8217;ve returned close to $50 billions back into the pockets of investors... At the heart of this investigation, is improving confidence for the investor and for the market, and today we&#8217;ve taken another giant step forward towards fulfilling this goal.</blockquote>The settlement also requires the banks to make payments to any investors who sold the securities for a loss, and require them to pay penalties in the amounts of $125 million for Merill Lynch, $22.5 million for Goldman Sachs, and $15 million for Deutsche Bank.  This particular settlement is part of a larger <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/aug/aug11a_08.html">investigation</a> [press release] into 30 different firms which sold approximately $60 million in auction rate securities to retail investors.  The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121934056869360701.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">more</a>.  The <em>New York Sun</em> has <a href="http://www.nysun.com/business/cuomo-may-sue-merrill-lynch/84370/">additional coverage</a>. <br /> <br />In 2006 Merill Lynch <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/merrill-lynch-to-pay-164-million-in.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay $164 million to settle 23 class action lawsuits involving Merrill Lynch&#39;s research of online companies in the 1990s.  Also in 2006, four former Merrill Lynch executives found guilty of charges connected with an <a href="http://www.enron.com/">Enron</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">news archive</a>] Nigerian barge scam, had their <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C05/05-20319-CR0.wpd.pdf">convictions overturned</a> [opinion text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">Fifth Circuit</a> [official website].  Experts believe that due to the success of the former Merrill Lynch executives, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/enron-ex-ceo-skilling-appeals.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of former Enron CEO <a href="http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/special/01/enron/skilling/skilling.html">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [Houston Chronicle profile] has a good chance of success.  Skilling was convicted under the theory of &quot;deprivation of honest services,&quot; which allows for the prosecution of those who enabled fraud but did not personally benefit from it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/063090p.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] Thursday that a Pennsylvania law imposing reporting and curriculum review requirements on parents who home school their children does not violate federal freedom of religion protections.  The case was brought by six families who had argued that <a href="http://www.pahomeschoolers.com/act169.html">Act 169</a> [text], the state law requiring the reviews, illegally burdened their right to freely exercise their religion. The appeals court disagreed and rejected claims the families had brought under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Fourteenth</a> amendments [LII backgrounders], as well as the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">Civil Rights Act</a> [text], saying the regulation did not impose an increased burden on these families:<blockquote>Act 169 is a neutral law of general applicability.  It neither targets religious practice nor selectively imposes burdens on religiously motivated conduct.  Instead, it imposes the same requirements on parents who home-school for secular reasons as on parents who do so for religious reasons.  Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests Commonwealth school officials discriminate against religiously motivated home education programs (e.g., denying approval of home education programs because they include faith-based curriculum materials).

As part of the program, the DOJ held <a href="http://www.firstfreedom.gov/ff_regionalseminars.html">training seminars</a> [DOJ materials] across the US, and the FFP website hosted instructions on <a href="http://www.firstfreedom.gov/ff_complaint.html">how to file a religious discrimination complaint</a> [DOJ materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] assigned a new panel of judges Thursday to the upcoming war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>].  The changes come following Karadzic&#39;s recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-requests-new-judges-for-icty.php">request</a> [JURIST report], in which he argued that presiding <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1420477.php/PROFILE_Alphons_Orie_the_pragmatic_Dutch_judge_whom_Karadzic_faces">Judge Alphons Orie</a> [DPA profile] and other judges assigned to the case are biased against him because they have overseen ICTY cases brought against various other former Bosnian Serb leaders, and would want to maintain their own lines of reasoning.  To illustrate his argument, Karadzic pointed to the case of <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/krajisnik.htm">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/krajisnik/trialc/judgement/kra-jud060927e.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">report</a>] to 27 years imprisonment for crimes similar to those of which Karadzic is accused.   According to ICTY spokesperson Nerma Jelacic, the moves were made to ensure proper trial management and not because of the request from Karadzic.  Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601127&sid=aNvsVbz_lYDQ&refer=law">more</a>.  <br /><br />Karadzic, who has been <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">indicted</a> [text] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. Later that month, Serbian authorities <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1277e.htm">transferred</a> [press release] Karadzic to the custody of the ICTY. Karadzic was originally <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">indicted</a> [text] in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report] until his arrest. He is accused of involvement in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other war crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Pakistan prime minister and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] head Nawaz Sharif has threatened to withdraw from the government if all of the judges ousted last year by President <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] are not reinstated by Friday, according to a <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080821/tap-pakistan-politics-sharif-2a5be5e.html">report</a> [AFP report]  published Thursday.  Lawyers&#39; groups in the country have also <a href="http://thenews.jang.com.pk/updates.asp?id=52750">demonstrated</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">News</font> report] against the failure of Pakistan&#39;s ruling coalition to reach an agreement on reinstating the judges, after the&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;between the PML-N and <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-still-seeking.php">failed</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday. Sharif said that the controversy centers around the reinstatement of former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], and that his party will withdraw from the government if he is not restored to his position. Also Thursday,  Pakistan Attorney General Malik Abdul Qayyum, who was appointed by Musharraf, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/20/content_9561336.htm">resigned</a> [Xinhua report] following the former President&#39;s <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/NewsEventsDetail.aspx?NewsEventID=4101">decision to step down</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">report</a>] on Tuesday. PPP senator Latif Khosa took Qayyum&#39;s place.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the coalition government said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-government-to-seek.php">push to impeach Musharraf</a> because he had given a &quot;clear commitment&quot; to step down from office after his party was defeated in <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/new-pakistan-parliament-could-reinstate.php">parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST reports], but subsequently refused to resign or go into exile, and because be had failed to follow through on a promise to ask parliament for a confidence vote.  In June, the PML-N <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-faces-renewed-impeachment.php">called for Musharraf&#39;s impeachment</a> [JURIST report] and released a &quot;charge sheet&quot; outlining misuse of presidential authority, including the dismissal of the country&#39;s superior court judges.  Also in June, PML-N leader and former Pakistani Prime Minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">Nawaz Sharif</a> [JURIST news archive] called for Musharraf to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/musharraf-should-be-tried-for-treason.php">tried for treason</a> [JURIST report], labeling him a traitor disloyal to Pakistan and saying he should be punished for the &quot;damage&quot; that he has done to the country in the years since he led a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472968.stm">military coup</a> [BBC backgrounder] and unseated Sharif in 1999.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] ] The <a href="http://www.diocese-kcsj.org/">Catholic Diocese of Kansas City</a> [official website] <a href="http://videos.kansascity.com/vmix_hosted_apps/p/media?id=2097994">announced</a> [Flash, video; <a href="http://www.diocese-kcsj.org/news/viewNews.php?id=18">press release</a>] on Thursday that it has agreed to pay $10 million to settle 47 sexual abuse claims against the church.  The deal also required the church to publicly renounce the alleged behavior and to take additional steps to prevent future instances of abuse. Kansas City Bishop Robert W. Finn made the public announcement:<br /><blockquote>We apologize for the fully unacceptable behavior that prompted these lawsuits to be brought against the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. With compassion for the victims of this behavior and with sadness over any failure by the diocese to serve as a proper steward of safety and security for our young people and our parishioners, I am here as an individual leader of the diocese to demonstrate institutional accountability for these sad events. I pray that with the settlement of this matter, the healing for all may truly begin...<br /><br />...In reaching a settlement with lawyers representing the families involved in this case, we took painstaking steps to fully vet all issues enabling thoroughness to be the hallmark of this process. Assured that we have met that standard, we have agreed to fund $10 million in payments to the victims and to adhere to a number of nonmonetary stipulations that should assure our community, our congregation and these families that the diocese will continue in its exercise of vigilance and in its devotion to training and education so that we may be confident there will never, ever be a repeat of the behaviors, the offenses, or the claims that have been associated with this matter.</blockquote>Many of the priests accused of sexual abuse continue to insist that they are innocent. AP has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-08-20-church-settlement_N.htm?csp=15">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Kansas City Star</span> has <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/637/story/757052.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />Other dioceses across the country have reached similar settlements. In September 2007, the <a href="http://www.diopitt.org/">Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh</a> [diocesan website]&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2007/09/pittsburgh-diocese-to-settle-clergy.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the creation of a $1.25 million fund and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.diocese-sdiego.org/">Catholic Diocese of San Diego</a> [diocesan website] announced an <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/san-diego-diocese-to-settle-144-clergy.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] to pay $198.1 million to settle claims of sexual abuse by their clergy. A Los Angeles Superior Court in July 2007 approved a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/los-angeles-catholic-archdiocese.php">$660 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the <a href="http://www.la-archdiocese.org/">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles</a> [diocesan website] and plaintiffs in 508 outstanding clergy sex abuse lawsuits. In January 2007, the <a href="http://www.dioceseofspokane.org/">Catholic Diocese of Spokane</a> [diocesan website] agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/spokane-diocese-agrees-to-48m-clergy.php">settle molestation claims</a> [JURIST report] against its own priests for $48 million as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan. The Archdiocese of Portland <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/portland-archdiocese-to-file-for.htm">filed for Chapter 11</a> [JURIST report] in 2004, and the dioceses of Tuscon, Spokane, and Davenport soon followed suit in the wake of <a href="/currentawareness/clergysexabuse.php">hundreds of sexual abuse lawsuits</a> [JURIST news archive] against clergy.&nbsp;

On Monday, Russian officials had expressed their <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russia-to-file-complaint-against.php">intent to file a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Georgia with the ICC, and said that their government is considering filing another complaint with the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website].  Russia&#39;s Foreign Ministry has also called for Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to be tried for war crimes before the ICC.  Last week, Georgia <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14657.pdf">filed a complaint</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/140/14659.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] against Russia with the ICJ, alleging that invading Russian troops have also engaged in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">murder, rape and mass displacement of civilians</a> [JURIST report].  <br /><br />Moreno-Ocampo has recently come under heavy criticism for his prosecutorial tactics and choices.  Earlier this week, the president of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [official website], mediation advisors, and other NGO leaders <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/18/humanrights.sudan">expressed doubt regarding his judgment</a> [The <font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-tactics-criticized-by.php">report</a>] and concern that his behavior could threaten the credibility of the court. Moreno-Ocampo has also received sharp criticism from both the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> (LAS) and the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/index/index.htm">African Union</a> (AU) [official websites] for his decision to seek the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-effort-to-arrest-sudan-president.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] London&#39;s High Court on Thursday <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/21/mohamed_full210808.pdf">ruled</a> [PDF, judgment] that the UK Foreign Office <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/uk-resident-in-guantanamo-wins-evidence-ruling-904530.html">must turn over evidence</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] &quot;essential&quot; to the defense of <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/casework_binyammohammed.htm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [Reprieve profile], the last British resident still detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Lawyers representing Mohamed at his US military commission trial had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-judge-orders-hearing-on-government.php">appeared</a> [JURIST report] before the High Court in July, arguing that the Foreign Office possessed evidence showing that Mohamed was tortured and went through <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive]. A Foreign Office spokesperson <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressR&id=5533536">commented</a> [press release]:<blockquote>For strong reasons of national security, to which the Court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight, we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily.  These and other issues relating to national security will be considered at a further hearing next week.</blockquote>Mohamed&#39;s lawyers have also <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0728/1217013340456.html">asked the Irish government</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report] to turn over information about <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">CIA rendition flights</a> [JURIST news archive] which allegedly landed in Ireland in 2002 and 2004 while transporting Mohamed. <br /><br />Mohamed says he was arrested in Pakistan and turned over to US officials who later transferred him to Moroccan agents who tortured him; he was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2004. In December, in a <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2007/12/10/12/07.12.09_MillibandReAbuse.source.prod_affiliate.56.doc">letter</a> [DOC, text] sent by his lawyer to UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband, he <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/guantanamo-detainee-alleges-cia-has.php">asked the UK government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that photographic evidence of his alleged torture be preserved. For most of 2007, Binyam was one of five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+residents+guantanamo">UK residents detained at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. Three of those were <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11576">released</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/uk-residents-released-from-guantanamo.php">report</a>] from US custody in December. The official status of a fourth detainee remains unclear.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0305p-06.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court&#39;s grant of summary judgment to a Tennessee public high school in a lawsuit brought by three students who claimed the school&#39;s ban on wearing the <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CLASS/AM483_97/projects/sarratt/intro.html">Confederate flag</a> [university course backgrounder] violated their First Amendment, Equal Protection, and Due Process rights under the US Constitution. The students had argued that they wanted to wear the flag on their clothing to express their pride in their southern heritage.  The Sixth Circuit carefully limited its holding in the case:<blockquote>We caution, however, that our decision today does not establish a precedent justifying a school&#8217;s ban on student speech merely because other students find that speech offensive: we simply hold that the school&#8217;s dress code as applied to ban the Confederate flag is constitutional because of the disruptive potential of the flag in a school where racial tension is high and serious racially motivated incidents, such as physical altercations or threats of violence, have occurred.</blockquote>The court reasoned that there was no First Amendment violation because &quot;the school reasonably forecast that images of the Confederate flag would substantially and materially disrupt the school environment,&quot; held that the Equal Protection guarantee was not infringed because &quot;the dress code&#8217;s ban on racially divisive symbols&quot; satisfied intermediate scrutiny, and determined that the students had forfeited their Due Process claim by not sufficiently developing it.  AP has <a href="http://www.kentucky.com/471/story/496590.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2003, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2003/12/tuesdays-federal-courts-roundup.htm">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the dismissal of a suit filed by Matthew Dixon, a man who was <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DA1730F932A05756C0A9659C8B63">fired for displaying Confederate flag stickers at work</a> [<em>New York Times</em> report].  South Carolina&#39;s Coburn Dairy, Inc. fired Dixon for continuing to display the stickers on his toolbox after a black co-worker complained. Dixon argued that the company violated his First Amendment rights and state employment laws, but the company maintained that Dixon was fired because he violated the company&#39;s harassment policy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ctbto.org/">Preparatory Commission</a> [official website] for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) <a href="http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2008/iraq-signs-the-comprehensive-nuclear-test-ban-treaty/">announced</a> [press release; Xinhua <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/21/content_9579143.htm">report</a>] on Wednesday that Iraq has signed the <a href="http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treaty_text.pdf">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty</a> (CTBT) [PDF text]. Only a few of the world&#39;s major nations are not CTBT signatories. The US signed the CTBT in 1996, but has cited national security concerns as justification for <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/ethiopia-ratifies-nuclear-test-ban.php">withholding ratification</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/us-continues-holdout-against-nuclear.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST reports] a 2005 UN conference designed to encourage the treaty&#39;s passage. The Preparatory Commission announced Thursday that it is completing advance set-up work for its <a href="http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2008/final-preparations-for-majorctbt-inspection-exercise/">Integrated Field Exercise</a> [press release] in Kazakhstan, where during September it will search for any evidence of recent nuclear testing.  The Exercise is meant to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CTBT&#39;s verification procedures. <br /><br />Last November, Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/iraq-to-join-chemical-weapons-treaty.php">announced its intention</a> [JURIST report] to accede to the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/docs/cwc_eng.pdf">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> (CWC) [PDF text] and become a member of the <a href="http://www.opcw.org/">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> (OPCW) [official website]. The CWC prohibits the use or undeclared storage of chemical weapons by member nations.  Iraqi President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4415531.stm">Jalal Talibani</a> [BBC profile] commented that acceding to the Convention would allow Iraq to seek help from other members in eradicating environmental problems caused by the use of chemical weapons during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/">1988 Anfal campaign</a> [HRW backgrounder] against ethnic Kurds.  Iraq has yet to complete the joining process, and still must deposit instruments of accession with the UN.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US district court judge ruled Wednesday that <a href="http://stevens.senate.gov/public/">US Senator Ted Stevens</a> (R-AK) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ted+stevens">news archive</a>] cannot transfer his corruption trial to Alaska from Washington, DC.  Rejecting Stevens&#39; argument that he needed to be in Alaska to campaign for re-election, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan said that the offense alleged in the indictment occurred in Washington and any change in venue would cause unnecessary delay and additional expense.  Stevens released a statement on the decision, <a href="http://stevens.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=e18723c3-d6d8-47a6-f8e1-0a0715d729ee&Region_id=&Issue_id=">stating</a> [text]:<blockquote>I urged my attorneys to request a venue change because I wanted Alaskans to have a first-hand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter. I understand the court&#8217;s decision today, and continue to have every faith in the fairness of the American judicial system and the court&#8217;s commitment to conduct a speedy trial. I welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that I am innocent of these charges.</blockquote> The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/20/AR2008082002137.html?hpid=moreheadlines">local coverage</a>. The <em>New York Times</em> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/washington/21stevens.html?ref=us">more</a>.<br /><br />Stevens was <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/07/29/Stevens_indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-senator-indicted-on-corruption.php">report</a>] last month on seven counts of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1001.html">making false statements</a> [18 USC s. 1001(a) text] relating to an alleged corruption scheme and for falsifying his Financial Disclosure forms.  Stevens allegedly accepted about $250,000 in gifts over an eight-year period from the founder of oil services and engineering company <a href="http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/energy/veco.asp">VECO Corp</a> [corporate website] and in exchange reportedly used his influence in Washington to improperly benefit the company and its employees.

CUL <a href="http://www.thechicagourbanleague.org/7232108201329597/lib/7232108201329597/Complaint.pdf">challenges</a> [complaint, PDF] the state&#39;s method for raising and distributing education funds to local school districts, which it claims results in &quot;constitutionally inadequate educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Illinois public school children.&quot;  CUL asserts that the state&#39;s public school funding scheme is &quot;fatally flawed&quot; because it relies too heavily on local property taxes, therefore reinforcing past discrimination and ensuring that certain school districts have &quot;no capacity to raise the revenues they desperately need to close the funding gap,&quot; explaining:<blockquote>the continuous and unmitigated harm that results each year from the state&#39;s persistent failure to meet its constitutional obligation to treat all students equally, regardless of race or ethnicity, to provide all Illinois students with access to equal education opportunity and to provide a system of schools offering a &quot;high quality&quot; education, is irreparable and unconscionable.</blockquote> CUL President Cheryle R. Jackson <a href="http://www.cul-chicago.org/chicagourbanleague/cwp/view.asp?A=3&Q=279359">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Our children, especially African Americans and Latinos, have been left behind because of poorly funded schools while their white counterparts in wealthy communities are thriving.  Their basic right to a quality education is being denied.  Through our litigation and civic engagement around this issue, we want to make sure no more children are given a second-class education.</blockquote> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/content/education/chi-school-funding-lawsuit-21aug21,0,1276468.story">local coverage</a>; Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2046858820080820">more</a>.<br /><br />Last year, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-upholds-federal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] on New Mexico&#39;s public school funding system, and found that the US Department of Education is permitted by statute to refer to the number of students in a school district as well as the per-student expenditures in school districts when determining whether a state &quot;equalizes expenditures&quot; among public school districts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials for Iraq&#39;s Human Rights Ministry have said that they plan to prosecute those suspected of torturing inmates of the country&#39;s prison system, according to a Wednesday <a href="http://www.metimes.com/Politics/2008/08/19/iraq_wants_to_put_torturers_on_trial/afp/">report</a> [AFP report].  The country signed on to the UN&#39;s <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">Convention Against Torture</a> [text] on Sunday, but has not yet explicitly prohibited the practice.  Prosecutors say they will find a way to use existing laws to charge offenders. The officials say the have documented dozens of cases of torture in Iraqi-run detention facilities, and that United Nations Special Investigator on Torture <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/">Manfred Nowak</a> [UN materials], who has voiced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5368360.stm">grave concern over conditions in the country</a> [BBC report], plans to visit Iraq in October. In 2005 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] issued a  <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/">report</a> [HRW materials, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/26/iraq10053.htm">press release</a>] citing numerous incidents of torture and prisoner abuse in the country since the 2003 US invasion.<br /><br /><div>In November 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/iraqi-officials-to-investigate.php">US troops found 173 prisoners</a> [JURIST report], many abused, in a secret bunker run by the Interior Ministry. Earlier that year, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that Iraq&#39;s detention practices may violate international law and <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/annan-iraq-detention-practices-may.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the failure of Coalition forces to publish the results of their investigation into the torture allegations. In December 2005&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2005/04/12/iraq/whoswho687537_0_7_person.shtml">Iraq Interior Minister Bayan Jabr</a> [CBS profile]&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2005/12/iraqi-human-rights-inspector-dismissed.php">fired</a> [JURIST report] Nouri al-Nouri, the country&#39;s senior inspector handling human rights issues, in connection with a torture scandal involving dozens of prisoners at a Baghdad prison. Jabr himself has been accused of running <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/iraqi-officials-to-investigate.php">secret prisons</a> [JURIST report] and controlling death squads, charges he has <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/torture-allegations-overblown-iraqi.php">downplayed or denied</a> [JURIST report].</div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Indonesian Attorney General Hendarman Supandji <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/">announced</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Jakarta Post</font> report] Wednesday that the men convicted of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder] will not be executed until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, during which the death penalty is not implemented. Supandji said that he could not approve the executions because he has not yet received certification from the country&#39;s Constitutional Court that the men,&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2542863.stm">Mukhlas</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2499943.stm">Imam Samudra</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2632043.stm">Amrozi Nurhasyim</a> [BBC profiles] have exhausted all of their appeals. Earlier this month, the court&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/08/indonesia-bali-bombers-appeal-argues.php">accepted the men&#39;s challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the country&#39;s use of firing squad&nbsp;executions, a punishment they argue amounts to&nbsp;&quot;torture&quot; and is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-01/2008-01-08-voa3.cfm?CFID=19277508&CFTOKEN=96779311">contrary to Islamic law</a> [VOA report].  That challenge alone would not be sufficient reason to postpone the executions.&nbsp;AFP has <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20080820%5cACQDJON200808200431DOWJONESDJONLINE000325.htm&&mypage=newsheadlines&title=Bali%20Bombers%20Won't%20Be%20Executed%20Before%20Ramadan">more</a>.<br /><br />All three men are members of the Southeast Asian terror group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>] and their lawyer had&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bali-bombers-filing-constitutional.php">promised to bring their constitutional challenge</a>&nbsp;against the penalty after the Indonesian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/indonesia-supreme-court-rejects-third.php">rejected their third appeal</a> [JURIST reports] of the charges in July. Their first appeal had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/indonesia-high-court-rejects-final.php">rejected</a> late last year, prompting an unusual <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bali-bombers-bid-for-high-court-second.php">second appeal</a>, which was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bali-nightclub-bombers-withdraw-second.php">withdrawn</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, Indonesian police <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indonesia-police-arrest-alleged-2005.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] another JI member, Faiz Fauzan, in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4300274.stm">another set of Bali bombings</a> [BBC report] in 2005. In March, an Indonesian judge handed down <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/indonesia-judge-sentences-jemaah.php">15-year sentences</a> [JURIST report] to two JI leaders, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140846.stm">Zarkasih</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6747349.stm">Abu Dujana</a> [BBC profiles] after convicting them of other terrorism charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran has executed a man for a stabbing he committed while still a minor, according Wednesday reports from local media. The execution is said to violate the terms of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/child.html">UN Convention on the Rights of a Child</a> [text], to which Iran is a signatory, but officials for the country argue that it and similar executions are allowed because the offenders reached the age of majority before being executed. <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/06/20/iran16211.htm">said</a> [press release] that Iran leads the world in executing the most people for crimes committed as children and advocacy campaign Stop Child Executions keeps a <a href="http://www.stopchildexecutions.com/the_row.aspx">list</a> [advocacy materials] of those facing execution. Last April, an Amnesty International <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE14/014/2007">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/iraq-execution-rate-now-worlds-fourth.php">report</a>] named Iran as having one of the three highest execution rates in the world, along with China and Pakistan. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080820/wl_mideast_afp/iranexecution_080820110153">more</a>.<br /><br />Earlier this month, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/iran-stops-use-of-stoning-as-method-of.php">commuted the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of four people scheduled to be executed by stoning and suspended the use of the punishment, after nine people were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7516238.stm">given the sentence</a> [BBC report] in July for adultery and sexual offenses despite a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/iran-to-investigate-judge-who-ordered.php">moratorium on the practice</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report].&nbsp;In July, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/iran-executions-increasing-in-number.php">hanged 29 people</a> [JURIST report] in Tehran in a move that human rights groups suggested was intended to challenge <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/un-rights-chief-condemns-stoning.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report] of its death penalty policies. Most executions in the country are carried out by hanging and are related to such crimes as murder and rape, although an Iranian airport customs officer was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp.php">executed for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in January.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The City of New York agreed to pay approximately $2 million to settle a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/A7%201st%20Amended%20Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; CCR <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kunstler-v.-city-new-york">backgrounder</a>] brought by protesters who had claimed they had been illegally arrested, according to Tuesday statements made by the city&#39;s Law Department.  In April 2003, city police arrested anti-war protesters while they were holding a demonstration outside the offices of military investment firm <a href="http://www.carlyle.com/">Carlyle Group</a> [corporate website], asserting that they were obstructing a sidewalk and engaging in disorderly conduct, but the protesters were later either released or acquitted of the charges.  The group argued that the city violated their rights to free speech and assembly, maliciously prosecuted and falsely imprisoned them, and failed to reprimand officers who had assaulted and battered them. In agreeing to the settlement, the city admitted no wrongdoing, but in a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/antiwar-activists-win-%242-million-settlement-new-york-city-major-victory-free">statement</a> [CCR release] from the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], which helped to file the claims, one protester was quoted as having said that she hoped the settlement would change city and national policy: <blockquote>We hope our victory helps convince the City to stop violating people&#39;s rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers&#39; money doing so... It should also serve as a reminder that Washington&#39;s illegal war in Afghanistan and Iraq is also being fought at home &#8211; against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like Carlyle and Halliburton.  We intend to continue our resistance until this stops.</blockquote>The <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</font> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/nyregion/20about.html?_r=1&bl&ex=1219377600&en=04d1c05c6f53a27f&ei=5087%0A&oref=slogin">more</a>.<br /><br />The city has come under a great deal of criticism for its handling of&nbsp;protesters,&nbsp;and in April the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU) [advocacy website]&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/Final_Stipulation_Order_040108.pdf">settled</a> [settlement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/nypd-settles-policing-tactics-lawsuit.php">report</a>] its lawsuit against the <a href="http://home2.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/home/home.shtml">New York Police Department</a> (NYPD) [official website] in which the NYCLU had challenged the department&#39;s protocol for dealing with large protests.&nbsp;In August 2007, The US District Court for the Southern District of New York&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nyclu.org/pdfs/rnc_ruling_decision_080607.pdf">ordered</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/nypd-ordered-to-release-surveillance.php">report</a>] the&nbsp;NYPD&nbsp;to redact and turn over hundreds of field intelligence reports containing information it had gathered through covert surveillance of organizations planning demonstrations at the 2004 Republican National Convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NYCLU has also forced the NYPD to <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/new-york-city-agrees-to-destroy.php">destroy hundreds of fingerprint records</a> [JURIST report] obtained as a result of other mass arrests of peaceful protesters.&nbsp;

		<title>Third Circuit rules FDA regulations do not bar state claim for mercury poisoning</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/071238p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Tuesday that existing <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">US Food and Drug Association</a> (FDA) [official website] regulations do not preempt a New Jersey woman&#39;s state claim that she was poisoned by the mercury in canned tuna.  The suit alleges that Tri-Union, producers of <a href="http://www.chickenofthesea.com/">Chicken-of-the-Sea</a> [company website] brand tuna, failed to warn consumers about the potential danger of mercury poisoning that resulted from the consumption of its products.  The Third Circuit rejected Tri-Union&#39;s argument that her claim was preempted by the FDA&#39;s regulatory scheme regarding the presence of mercury in fish:<blockquote>This is a situation in which the FDA has promulgated no regulation concerning the risk posed by mercury in fish or warnings for that risk, has adopted no rule precluding states from imposing a duty to warn, and has taken no action establishing mercury warnings as misbranding under federal law or as contrary to federal law in any other respect.  [The] lawsuit does not conflict with the FDA&#8217;s &#8220;regulatory scheme&#8221; for the risks posed by mercury in fish or the warnings appropriate for that risk because the FDA simply has not regulated the matter.<br /><br />The FDA has only issued a consumer advisory regarding the risks posed by mercury in fish and established a guideline regarding mercury concentrations to guide its enforcement decisions.  Neither of these agency acts constitutes a federal legal standard or binding regulatory action on the subject which could give rise to a conflict, and indeed neither expresses a policy or viewpoint or approach inherently inconsistent with [the] lawsuit.  In the final analysis, this case involves an agency effort to preempt an area of law traditionally within the states&#8217; police powers</blockquote>The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court&#39;s opinion.<br /><br />In dismissing the claim, the district court relied on a <a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fl-ltr65.html">letter</a> [text] sent by the FDA to then-California Attorney General <a href="http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/bio.asp">Bill Lockyer</a> [official profile] after he filed a  state suit against a number of tuna canners, including Tri-Union, for their failure to warn consumers that their tuna products contained dangerous mercury compounds in June 2004.  The letter, signed by then-Commissioner of the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/crawford/bio.html">Lester Crawford</a> [official profile], warned that Lockyer&#39;s suit would &#8220;frustrate the [FDA&#8217;s] carefully considered federal approach&#8221; regarding the regulation of mercury in fish.  The Superior Court of California ultimately <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/13/BAGUKIR4DR1.DTL&hw=mercury&sn=001&sc=1000">found that Lockyer&#39;s suit was preempted by federal law</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> report] in May 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/07-5127-1134687.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in a 2-1 decision Friday that provisions in the <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/gwbush/sarbanesoxley072302.pdf">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</a> [PDF text] establishing the <a href="http://www.pcaobus.org/">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a> (PCAOB) [official website] are constitutional. In 2006, the Free Enterprise Fund, a non-profit public interest organization promoting economic growth, lower taxes, and limited government, and a Nevada accounting firm, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.becksteadwatts.com%2F&ei=60GwSLOdJo_SecrC_IUB&usg=AFQjCNENtyP5PknY9PLAdlOHRwnELewMGg&sig2=-C7cOzvxIKRHmjxJIYv1fg">Beckstead and Watts, LLP</a> [corporate website], <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/starr-leads-conservative.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] certain portions of the legislation alleging that it violated separation of powers doctrine because it did not give the President sufficient control over the agency. The Court majority wrote: <blockquote>In appellants&#8217; view this statutory scheme vests Board members &#8220;with far reaching executive power while completely stripping the President of the authority to appoint or remove those members or otherwise supervise or control their exercise of that power.&#8221; Appellants&#8217; Br. at 1. But their facial challenge ignores the entirety of the statutory scheme and runs afoul of the Supreme Court&#8217;s instruction regarding the nature of the President&#8217;s constitutional relationship with independent administrative agencies. Supreme Court precedent as we have it does not support appellants&#8217; singular focus on removal powers as the be-all and end-all of Executive authority, but rather compels a more nuanced approach that examines the myriad means of Executive control.<br /><br />We hold, first, that the Act does not encroach upon the Appointment power because, in view of the Commission&#8217;s comprehensive control of the Board, Board members are subject to direction and supervision of the Commission and thus are inferior officers not required to be appointed by the President. Second, we hold that the for-cause limitations on the Commission&#8217;s power to remove Board members and the President&#8217;s power to remove Commissioners do not strip the President of sufficient power to influence the Board and thus do not contravene separation of powers, as that principle embraces independent agencies like the Commission and their exercise of broad authority over their subordinates. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the Board and the United States.</blockquote>In 2007, the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="http://cei.org/pdf/5832.pdf">granted summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the PCAOB, finding that the plaintiffs&#39; facial challenge failed to establish that no set of circumstances could exist under which the Act would be valid. Beckstead has said that it will either appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court or attempt to have another hearing before the full panel of the appeals court. Bloomberg has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aGB1k8v8WjTs&refer=home">more</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/22/AR2008082202997.html?hpid=sec-business">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Consistent with the overall purpose of Sarbanes-Oxley, the PCAOB was created in response to the collapse of <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron</a> and the other <a href="/currentawareness/corporatefraud.php">corporate fraud scandals</a> [JURIST news archives] that made headlines in 2002.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New York Attorney General <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/bio.html">Andrew M. Cuomo</a> [official website] announced on Monday that twelve states have <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/aug/aug25b_08.html">filed suit</a> [press release] against the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] for its alleged failure to enforce provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85.html">Clean Air Act</a> [text; EPA <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/oaq_caa.html/">materials</a>] requiring oil refineries to adopt measures curbing the pollution contributing to global warming.  The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/Content/Home+Page">Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website], alleges that the EPA is required to issue so-called <a href="http://www.epa.gov/nsr/">New Source Performance Standards</a> (NSPS) [EPA materials] to oil refineries, power plants, and any other facility the EPA concludes emits air pollution posing a danger to public health.  These standards, once issued, require the facility to install new technologies mitigating the release of such pollutants.  According to the complaint, on June 24 the EPA finalized <a href="http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2008/June/Day-24/a13498.pdf">new air pollution control standards</a> [PDF text] for oil refineries without issuing an NSPS, violating the Clean Air Act&#39;s protocols.  Along with New York, the other states joining in the lawsuit are California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Oregon, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts, and Delaware. AP has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D92PEGMO1.htm">more</a>. <br /><br />The lawsuit is the latest attempt by New York and several other states to force the EPA to comply with Clean Air Act terms requiring global warming pollution regulation.  Last week, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/04-1243-1133914.pdf">vacated</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/dc-circuit-strikes-down-epa-ban-on.php">report</a>] a 2006 <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/E6-21335.pdf">rule</a> [Federal Register notice] prohibiting state and local governments from monitoring air pollution below acceptable levels set by the EPA for &quot;stationary&quot; sources such as power plants and factories.  Earlier this year, 14 states <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/environmental-groups-states-sue-epa.php">sued the EPA over new smog regulations</a> [JURIST report].  In 2006, a group of states <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/states-sue-epa-for-alleged-clean-air.php">sued the EPA</a> [JURIST report] over its alleged failure to regulate smog emissions from power plants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2342">District Judge Joseph Tauro</a> [official profile] <a href="http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/tauro/pdf/mccullen%20v%20coakley%20memorandum.pdf">held </a> [PDF text] Friday that a Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/266-120e.5.htm">statute</a> [text] establishing a 35-foot buffer zone outside facilities which perform <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] does not violate protesters&#39; constitutional rights. Tauro found that the law does not unconstitutionally burden First Amendment rights or the guarantees of equal protection or due process.  In upholding the statute as a valid time, place and manner regulation of speech, Tauro wrote: <blockquote>[T]he law does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further these public safety goals. ... &quot;[T]he government is not required to choose the least restrictive approach in content-neutral regulation.&quot; Here, the Legislature appears to have carefully considered and balanced the Act&#39;s effects on speech with the Commonwealth&#39;s legitimate governmental interests. The result was a 35-foot fixed buffer zone that targeted the problematic areas (areas immediately adjacent to [clinic] entrances and driveways), during the problematic times.</blockquote> Tauro noted that other federal courts, including the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>], have upheld similar fixed buffer zones.    <br /><br />Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/massachusetts-governor-signs-bill.php">signed a bill amending the statute</a> [JURIST report] last year, substituting the fixed buffer zone for a &quot;floating&quot; one that prohibited protesters from coming within six feet of other individuals without their consent. Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagohomepage&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago">Attorney General Martha Coakley</a> [official website] defended the law on Monday, saying it protects public safety and ensures access to medical care while preserving alternate opportunities for expression.  She <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagopressrelease&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago&b=pressrelease&f=2008_08_25_bufferzonevictory&csid=Cago">commented</a> [press release; AP <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/politics/view/2008_08_25_Federal_judge_OKs_Mass__abortion_buffer_zone_law/srvc=home&position=recent">report</a>], &quot;The previous buffer zone statute was a step in the right direction, but was difficult, if not impossible, to enforce.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Swiss Prosecutor General Daniel Zappelli announced on Monday that he will not pursue money-laundering charges against Pakistani presidential candidate <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/saazcv.html">Asif Ali Zardari</a> [CV; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">profile</a>], who is the widower of the assassinated former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Zappelli explained that Geneva was left with insufficient evidence to continue after authorities in <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archive] dropped their own <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/pakistan-court-drops-corruption-charges.php">corruption</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/pakistan-court-clears-bhutto-widower-of.php">smuggling charges</a> [JURIST report] against Zardari, who heads the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) [party website]. Zardari and Bhutto had been suspected of using Swiss bank accounts to launder $12 million paid by companies which contracted with the Pakistani government to perform customs inspections, but Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/pakistan-court-drops-bhutto-corruption.php">dismissed charges</a> against Bhutto shortly after she <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">was assassinated last year</a> [JURIST reports]. Zappelli has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSLQ17107020080826">unfrozen $60 million in seized assets</a> [Reuters report] but Geneva&#39;s government will receive over $3 million.

On Monday, Pakistan&#39;s coalition government <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif withdrew his <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [official website] party over the failure to reach an agreement with the PPP to reinstate the ousted judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] British nationals and former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Rhuhel Ahmed and Jamal Al-Harith have <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/rasul-petition-8-22-08.pdf">petitioned</a> [cert. petition, PDF] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to hear a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/rasul-v.-rumsfeld">lawsuit</a> [advocacy backgrounder] in which they seek religious rights and protection from torture for those still at the facility.  In the petition, <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-235.htm">docketed</a> [08-235 text] Monday, the men argue that a lower court&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-torture.php">dismissal of their claims</a> [JURIST report] should be reversed after&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/alovuni">Boumediene v.

The men argue that the Court should hear the case because of the gravity of the issues addressed and the claimed error of the lower court:<blockquote>Guanta?namo continues to present numerous jurisprudential challenges to the judiciary.  This case provides a critical opportunity for this Court to affirm strongly the guarantee to Guanta?namo detainees of an irreducible minimum of human rights.  It is essential for this Court to reverse the Court of Appeals&#8217; decision, which manifests indifference to religious abuse and torture and flouts the Guanta?namo jurisprudence carefully developed and expounded by this Court.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] had previously dismissed the plaintiffs&#39; <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+28USC1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text] claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, along with their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title42/chapter21b_.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text] claim because of their status as &quot;enemy&nbsp;combatants.&quot; &nbsp;The Supreme Court is scheduled to decide whether to grant <em>certiorari</em> on or before September 24. AFP has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080825/pl_afp/usattacksguantanamojusticecourt_080825215203">more</a>.<br /><br />The&nbsp;appellants&nbsp;in the case are among eight former British detainees who in April <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-ex-guantanamo-prisoners-suing.php">sued</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] the UK&#39;s <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> and <a href="http://www.mi6.gov.uk/">MI6</a> [official websites] intelligence services over alleged complicity with the US in their abduction and subsequent treatment, which included interrogation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.sosweb.state.ar.us/">Arkansas Secretary of State</a> [official website] Charlie Daniels has certified a <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/elections_pdfs/proposed_amendments/2007-293_Adopt_or_Foster_parent.html">ballot measure</a> [text; AR AG <a href="http://ag.arkansas.gov/opinions/docs/2007-293.pdf">opinion</a>, PDF] which could prohibit gays, lesbians and other unmarried cohabiting couples from becoming either foster or adoptive parents. Daniels <a href="http://www.sosweb.state.ar.us/newsroom/index.php?do:newsDetail=1&news_id=74">announced</a> [press release] Monday that the <a href="http://www.familycouncil.org/fcac.asp">Arkansas Family Council Action Committee</a> [advocacy website] had submitted petitions containing the valid signatures of more than 85,000 registered voters - nearly 25,000 more than needed to place the measure on the November ballot. The proposed act provides, in part, that <blockquote>(a)    A minor may not be adopted or placed in a foster home if the individual seeking to adopt or to serve as a foster parent is cohabiting with a sexual partner outside of a marriage which is valid under the constitution and laws of this state.<br />(b)  The prohibition of this section applies equally to cohabiting opposite-sex and same-sex individuals.</blockquote>The measure further stipulates that &quot;it is in the best interest of children in need of adoption or foster care to be reared in homes in which adoptive or foster parents are not cohabiting outside of marriage.&quot; The group <a href="http://arkansasfamiliesfirst.org/">Arkansas Families First</a> [advocacy website] has announced plans to <a href="http://arkansasfamiliesfirst.org/learn/news/15.php">challenge the ballot measure in court</a> [press release] because of alleged duplications, forgeries and other irregularities in the petitions submitted to Daniels. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5g7iadH82keTlCIw5xZg9NvT6SzvAD92PGN400">more</a>. <br /><br />The ballot measure follows a 2006 Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="http://courts.state.ar.us/opinions/2006a/20060629/05-814.pdf">decision</a> [PDF text] that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down an administrative regulation</a> [JURIST report] specifically prohibiting homosexuals from rearing foster children. Reacting to that decision, then-Gov. Mike Huckabee suggested that such a ban be <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-governor-wants-legislation.php">implemented through legislation</a> [JURIST report].  Arkansas, like many states, has amended its <a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/data/constitution/ArkansasConstitution1874.pdf">constitution</a> [PDF text] to prohibit the recognition of <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive]. An initiative prohibiting same-sex marriage <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">is on the ballot in California</a> this year despite an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/california-court-rejects-challenge-to.php">attempt to remove it</a> [JURIST reports]. That measure would overcome a California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] holding that a ban on same-sex marriage violates the state constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Prosecutors in Thailand have asked the nation&#39;s Supreme Court to seize over $2 billion from the frozen accounts and holdings of former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>] and his wife <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Pojamarn Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Pojamarn">news archive</a>], who already forfeited nearly $400,000 when they fled to the UK while on bail from corruption charges.  Earlier this month, the Court announced plans to <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080815/D92IJ3S81.html">try the two <em>in absentia</em></a> [AP report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-court-to-try-ex-pm-thaksin-and.php">report</a>] after the couple <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-high-court-issues-arrest.php">refused to return</a> from the UK and accused the Court of <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/thailand-officials-deny-thaksin.php">bias</a> [JURIST reports] against them. <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=129527">Arrest warrants were issued</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] when they failed to appear in court.

The <em>Telegraph</em> has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/thailand/2619025/Thaksin-Shinawatra-Prosecutors-apply-to-seize-millions.html">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Last month, the Thai Attorney General&#39;s Office <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/thailand-prosecutors-file-new.php">filed corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Thaksin for his role in a 2003 resolution reducing fees paid by mobile phone companies to state telecommunications agencies. In April, Pojamarn <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/wife-of-thailand-ex-pm-denies.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/thailand-ex-pm-returning-in-may-to-face.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] stemming from a 2003 agreement with the government-directed <a href="http://www.bot.or.th/BotHomepage/Special/FIDF/foundation_e.htm">Financial Institutions Development Fund</a> [official website] to purchase land said to be worth three times more than the $26 million she paid for it.

Sharif had set Friday as the deadline for the PML-N and the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan People&#39;s Party</a> (PPP) to agree on the reinstatement of all of the judges ousted last year by President <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">Pervez Musharraf</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>], who recently <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/NewsEventsDetail.aspx?NewsEventID=4101">resigned</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">report</a>] from office. Sharif has focused his push for reinstatement on former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], and has said that he considers the Supreme Court as currently constituted to be illegitimate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials from the <a href="http://www.ncis.navy.mil/index.asp">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> (NCIS) [official website] said Friday that notes found in the clothes of three Guantanamo detainees who <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">committed suicide</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 indicated that they were seeking martyrdom. Military investigations of the suicides <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/pentagon-says-no-need-for-independent.php">began</a> [JURIST report] immediately after the two Saudi and one Yemeni men were found in their cells, and the military quickly rejected calls for independent civilian investigations. The military similarly rejected requests by the governments of <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/yemen-calls-for-probe-into-guantanamo.php">Yemen</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/guantanamo-suicides-spark-renewed.php">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST reports] to reform the investigation process. The NCIS has now reportedly closed the investigation. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i4KdWHSP9WjJzsdn3VDGx8_w4Z-wD92NM9F80">more</a>.<br /><br />Military officials said that the three detainees, who hanged themselves using nooses made from sheets and clothes, had participated in hunger strikes and were among those who had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-army-general-confirms-force-feeding.php">force-fed</a> [JURIST report].  None of the detainees had previously attempted suicide. Reacting to the deaths, rights groups condemned prisoners&#39; continued indefinite detention at Guantanamo.  <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] said the deaths &quot;are the tragic results of years of arbitrary and indefinite detention&quot; and should serve as &quot;an indictment on [Guantanamo&#39;s] deteriorating human rights record.&quot; The New York-based <a href="hhttp://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website], which represents several hundred detainees, called for the detainees to &quot;be taken to court or released.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.3rdcoa.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Third Court of Appeals</a> [official website] has allowed money-laundering indictments to stand against two alleged co-conspirators of former US House Majority Leader <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/delay.php">Tom DeLay</a> (R-TX) [JURIST news archive], rejecting their argument that the state laws used to prosecute them were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The Austin-based intermediate appellate court on Friday <a href="http://www.3rdcoa.courts.state.tx.us/opinions/PDFOpinion.asp?OpinionId=17193">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a trial court&#39;s denial of <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> relief sought by John Colyandro and Jim Ellis, who were originally <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/tx-grand-jury-indicts-delay-aides.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2004. The defendants are accused of accepting $190,000 in illegal campaign contributions from corporations and transferring the money to the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/">Republican National Committee</a> [party website], which then allegedly donated the same amount to candidates for the Texas Legislature.  The court concluded that restrictions on corporate campaign contributions in the <a href="http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/EL/content/pdf/el.015.00.000253.00.pdf">Texas Elections Code</a> [PDF, text] need not survive strict scrutiny, and Justice G. Alan Waldrop wrote: <blockquote>[W]e believe that a person of ordinary intelligence is capable of intending and designating his or her contributions to a political committee to be for lawful purposes unrelated to supporting or opposing a political candidate. Whether misuse of such funds by the political committee or innocent redistribution of such funds for unlawful purposes may have implications for the contributor or raise additional constitutional concerns is not before us in this appeal.</blockquote> An attorney for DeLay <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/region/legislature/stories/08/25/0825delay.html">predicted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Austin American-Statesman</span> report] on Monday that the charges against the defendants would eventually be dismissed because the defendants are accused of accepting checks, while the appellate court concluded that the term &quot;funds&quot; applied only to cash until the language was amended in 2005. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gtAjfT_dhEMUkWeHU5VC-VHbsu8QD92OESIO0">more</a>.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Houston Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/5962566.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />DeLay himself still faces money-laundering and conspiracy charges, although another conspiracy charge was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/texas-appeal-court-upholds-dismissal-of.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] last year. Following his <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/breaking-news-tom-delay-indicted-in.php">indictment</a> in 2005, DeLay <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/delay-steps-down-as-house-majority.php">stepped down as House majority leader</a>, later <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/delay-to-resign-from-congress-as-legal.php">resigning from Congress</a> and eventually <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/delay-to-remove-name-from-ballot-after.php">withdrawing his candidacy for re-election</a> [JURIST reports]. Separately, a former aide to DeLay  <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/former-delay-aide-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 to conspiring with lobbyist <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive] and others to bribe public officials. The US Senate Indian Affairs Committee that year <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/senate-panel-calls-abramoff.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] calling the connections between Abramoff and another former DeLay aide &quot;astonishing.&quot; US Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH) also <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/ohio-congressman-pleads-guilty-in.php">pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements</a> [JURIST report] after accepting money and gifts in exchange for taking actions on behalf of Abramoff and his clients.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US military judge in Colorado sentenced US Army <a href="http://www.couragetoresist.org/x/content/blogcategory/42/88/">Pfc. Robin Long</a> [advocacy website] Friday to 15 months in prison, dishonorable discharge and demotion after Long pleaded guilty to desertion with intent to remain away permanently. Long fled to Canada in 2005 in moral opposition to the war in Iraq and filed for <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/about/tribunals/rpd/index_e.htm">refugee status</a> [Refugee Protection Division website] there, but a Canadian immigration judge <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/decisions/reflex/index_e.htm?action=article.fulltext&id=12500">denied</a> [opinion, RTF] his motion in August 2007, writing: <blockquote>I find nothing in the claimant&#8217;s evidence that would support a finding that he could not rely upon the state to protect him from persecution or any other harm.  There is no support for a finding that it was objectively reasonable for the claimant not to have sought protection in his country.</blockquote> Canadian officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/canada-deports-us-soldier-avoiding-iraq.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] Long to the US in July. US authorities initially charged him with desertion with intent to shirk hazardous duty, a more serious offense under the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj2.htm#885.%20ART.%2085.%20DESERTION">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> [885. Art. 85 text], but Long pleaded to the lesser offense of desertion with intent to remain away permanently the same day as the <a href="http://search.carson.army.mil/pao-news/press-releases/#840">scheduled start</a> [press release] of his court-martial proceedings. The <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/23/us/23resist.html?_r=1&bl&ex=1219636800&en=14aa4f839c5b8c72&ei=5087%0A&oref=slogin">more</a>. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Toronto Star</span> has <a href="http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/483518">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In early July, Canada&#39;s House of Commons passed a non-binding resolution to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080603.wdeserters0603/BNStory/National">grant US military deserters asylum</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Globe and Mail</span> report]. In November 2007, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/Welcome/index_e.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] declined to hear the appeals of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hinzman">Jeremy Hinzman</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://www.brandonhughey.com/">Brandon Hughey</a> [advocacy website], two US military deserters who had unsuccessfully <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/us-soldier-seeks-asylum-in-canada.php">applied for asylum</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/about/index_e.htm">Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada</a> (IRB) [official website]. The IRB had <a href="http://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/decisions/public/hinzman/hinzman_e.htm">concluded</a> [decision text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/canada-denies-asylum-to-us-army-iraq.php">report</a>] that the two men would receive a fair trial if they were returned to the US and that they would not face persecution or cruel and unusual punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials for the <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] announced Friday that a Scottish judge will preside over the preparatory stages of the upcoming war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/cis-karadzicmladic.pdf">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>]. The designation of <a href="http://un.org/icty/officials/bonomy-e.htm">Judge Iain Bonomy</a> [ICTY biography], who served on the ICTY trial court for late Yugoslav president <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive], followed Thursday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icty-assigns-new-judges-to-karadzic-war.php">announcement</a> [JURIST report] that there would be a new panel of judges assigned to the case. Karadzic recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-requests-new-judges-for-icty.php">requested the new panel</a> [JURIST report], arguing that presiding <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1420477.php/PROFILE_Alphons_Orie_the_pragmatic_Dutch_judge_whom_Karadzic_faces">Judge Alphons Orie</a> [DPA profile] and other judges initially assigned were biased against him because they had overseen ICTY cases brought against various other former Bosnian Serb leaders, and would want to maintain their own lines of reasoning.  To illustrate his argument, Karadzic pointed to the case of <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/glance/krajisnik.htm">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [ICTY backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/krajisnik/trialc/judgement/kra-jud060927e.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">report</a>] to 27 years imprisonment for crimes similar to those of which Karadzic is accused.   According to ICTY spokesperson Nerma Jelacic, the moves were made to ensure proper trial management and not because of the request from Karadzic. Bonomy is scheduled to hear Karadzic&#39;s pleas on August 29. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7577457.stm">more</a>. The <font style="font-style: italic;">Scotsman</font> has <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Scottish-judge-will-oversee-runup.4420717.jp">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />Karadzic, who has been <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ai000428e.htm">indicted</a> [text] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. Later that month, Serbian authorities <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2008/pr1277e.htm">transferred</a> [press release] Karadzic to the custody of the ICTY. Karadzic was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-ii950724e.htm">originally indicted</a> [text] in 1995, but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report] until his arrest. He is accused of involvement in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] massacre and other war crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Croats during ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] Friday abandoned a <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/ice-scheduled-departure-program.htm">pilot program</a> [fact sheet; <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/0807/080731washington.htm">press release</a>] it created to allow certain illegal immigrants to coordinate their removal from the US with ICE without the risk of home raids, arrest or detention. The Scheduled Departure Program was a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ice-launches-voluntary-deportation.php">pilot program</a> [JURIST report] started on August 5 that ran through August 22 in <a href="http://www.ice.gov/scheduled-departure/index.htm">five major cities</a> [program overview], designed for illegal immigrants without criminal records who had ignored official removal orders. The program was considered by many to be a failure after only eight people turned themselves in. It was estimated that 457,000 were eligible for the program, including 30,000 located in the test cities of Charlotte, Chicago, Santa Ana, Phoenix, and San Diego. <a href="http://www.ice.gov/about/leadership/dro_bio/james_hayes.htm">Jim Hayes</a> [official profile], acting director of ICE&#39;s <a href="http://www.ice.gov/about/operations.htm">Office of Detention and Removal</a> (DRO) [ICE Operations sheet], did not express disappointment in the program, but <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i5prhLjHvlhYqvnvbzyaGXUtL1WAD92N927O0">told</a> [AP report] the Associated Press Thursday, &quot;Quite frankly, I think this proves the only method that works is enforcement.&quot; Immigration rights groups such as <a href="http://icirr.org/">Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights</a> (ICIRR) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chirla.org%2F&ei=YzawSJWnGZK2etW_hX4&usg=AFQjCNG9g04wLJei3CFUO5sdxpe5d9jbdg&sig2=yCWoIWrAw0DWsuUHYMKc5g">Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles</a> [advocacy website] had expressed doubt about the program from the start, saying there was little incentive for immigrants to turn themselves in. The <span style="font-style:italic;">San Antonio Express</span> has <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/nation/5961188.html">more</a>. <br /><br />ICE maintains a number of additional <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/factsheets/immigration_enforcement_initiatives.htm">initiatives</a> [fact sheet] to combat illegal immigration, including an increased number of raids. In May, 270 illegal immigrants arrested during an ICE-led raid at an <a href="http://www.agriprocessor.com/">Agriprocessors Inc.</a> [corporate website] meatpacking plant in Iowa were each <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">sentenced to five months in prison</a> [JURIST report] and 27 more received probation after pleading guilty to the use of false immigration documents. ICE also carried out a raid in California the same month targeting 495 people who had ignored deportation orders, resulting in the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/pi/news/newsreleases/articles/080523losangeles.htm">arrest of more than 900 illegal immigrants</a> [ICE press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judges for the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/G41FG4UK.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the use of specific documents from an illegal immigrant&#39;s alien-registration file during the immigrant&#39;s criminal trial is constitutional. The issue came before the court when the defendant, Franklin Burgos, appealed his conviction on one count of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/usc_sec_08_00001326----000-.html">illegal reentry into the US</a> [8 USC 1326(b)(2) text] subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, arguing that the US government&#39;s use of his deportation warrant and certificate of nonexistence of record (CNR) violated the Sixth Amendment&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html#amdt6_hd30">Confrontation Clause</a> [LII backgrounder; amendment <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am6">text</a>]. In holding that there was no violation of the Confrontation Clause because the records did not constitute testimony against the defendant, the court wrote: <blockquote>These documents have many attributes in common with business records. A warrant of deportation records the movement of a deported alien; the signing witness attests to the alien&#8217;s departure from the country. The warrant&#8217;s primary purpose is to memorialize the deportation, not to prove facts in a potential future criminal prosecution. ...<br /><br />[B]ecause the database underlying the CNR is not maintained for the primary purpose of proving facts in criminal prosecutions, the CNR itself, attesting to the absence of a record within that database, is a nontestimonial business record.</blockquote> The court also found that even if the trial judge denied Burgos&#39; request for new counsel, judges have wide discretion in granting changes of counsel, and a denial in this case would not have constituted abuse of discretion.<br /><br />US immigration prosecutions have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-prosecutions-of-illegal.php">continued to increase</a> [JURIST report] this year, jumping nearly 50 percent from February to March and nearly 75 percent from the previous year, according to a <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/188/">report</a> [text; <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/whatsnew/email.080617.html">press release</a>] released in June by the <a href="http://trac.syr.edu/">Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse</a> (TRAC) [official website] at Syracuse University. Federal immigration prosecutions have <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-prosecutions-of-illegal-immigrants.php">risen since February</a> [JURIST report], when such prosecutions hit a record high. TRAC attributed the increase to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2008/06/02/GR2008060200068.html">Operation Streamline</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> backgrounder], a joint federal program under which federal prosecutors levy minor charges against illegal immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. &quot;Reentry of a deported alien&quot; is by far the most common criminal charge in immigration prosecutions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/27E1F4B2BE817B2F882574AC007E3E98/$file/0617243.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the federal <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-200.html">Truth in Lending Act</a> (TILA) [text] does not provide for statutory relief for a lender&#39;s failure to conspicuously disclose certain information about a loan to the borrower and to give the borrower certain information before offering the loan. The issue came before the court as an appeal from an earlier <a href="http://207.41.19.15/web/bap.nsf/9C9E35D5D459537788257226006463DE/$file/Ferrell-05-1420.pdf?openelement">decision</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://207.41.19.15/Web/bap.nsf/baphome?OpenPage">Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel</a> [official website], which held that a debtor who had borrowed money through a subprime <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/payday/">payday loan</a> [FDIC backgrounder] could not later recover for the lender&#39;s failure to abide by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00001632----000-.html">conspicuous-disclosure</a> [15 USC s. 1632(a) text] and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sec_15_00001638----000-.html">information-sharing</a> [15 USC 1638(b)(1) text] requirements. In affirming that decision, judges for the Court of Appeals wrote: <blockquote>[A] consumer may not recover statutory damages under &sect; 1640(a) for violations of &sect; 1638(b)(1) and its corresponding regulations, 12 C.F.R &sect; 226.17(b). As the Trustee has not enforced any liability under &sect; 1640(a)(2), she is not entitled to attorneys&#8217; fees and costs pursuant to &sect; 1640(a)(3). ...<br /><br />A violation of &sect; 1632(a) cannot form the basis for statutory damages, as it does not fall within the closed list of &sect; 1638(a) subsections, violations of which can support an award of statutory damages.</blockquote> The circuit court also affirmed the bankruptcy court&#39;s decision that the plaintiff had not shown that the debtor detrimentally relied on the loan information available to him, and so found that he was not entitled to actual damages.<br /><br />In June, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/homepage.htm">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] announced that more than <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mortgagefraud061908.htm">400 people had been indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/fbi-names-more-than-400-in-mortgage.php">report</a>] in connection with what has been termed the US &quot;sub-prime mortgage collapse.&quot; Most of the indictments involved fraud related to individual mortgages, with the FBI focusing on lending fraud, foreclosure rescue scams and mortgage-related bankruptcy schemes, which account for more than $1 billion in losses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] has asked the <a href="http://www.courts.wa.gov/index.cfm">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] to determine whether the sister of a man whose bodily tissues were harvested for medical research without consent may sue for damages. In an <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/7FE749BE8F642F85882574B0007164AC/$file/0735241o.pdf?openelement">order</a> [PDF] issued Tuesday, a Ninth Circuit panel found that plaintiff Robinette Amaker had raised dispositive issues of unsettled state law, certifying to the Washington court the questions of whether Amaker, as the decedent&#39;s sister, has standing to sue for tortious interference with a corpse and whether the state&#39;s now-repealed version of the <a href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/uaga/2006final.htm">Uniform Anatomical Gift Act</a> [materials] created a private right of action. The court wrote: <blockquote>This case presents an opportunity for the state supreme court to identify which claims may be brought in cases arising out of non-consensual organ donation. Likewise, the court may wish to consider the interplay between the Anatomical Gift Act and claims for tortious interference with a corpse...Amaker argues there is tension between the two [district court] holdings: she was legally permitted to donate [her brother&#39;s] organs, but she did not have the legal right to dispose of the body. The Washington court may wish to remedy this tension, or it may conclude that the policy rationales behind the common law claim and the [Uniform Act] compel this outcome.</blockquote>When the man died, the <a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/health/examiner/">King County Medical Examiner&#39;s Office</a> [official website] could not reach his next of kin, and so sent tissue from his brain, liver and spleen to the <a href="http://www.stanleyresearch.org/dnn/">Stanley Medical Research Institute</a> (SMRI) [organization website]. The medical examiner&#39;s office has <a href="http://www.kirotv.com/investigations/4882584/detail.html">faced several lawsuits</a> [KIRO-TV report] over its defunct tissue-harvesting program, which raised nearly $1.5 million over 10 years.  The <span style="font-style:italic;">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</span> has <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/376594_organs27.html">more</a>.<br /><br />In 2005, Indiana governor Mitch Daniels <a href="http://www.in.gov/serv/presscal?PF=gov2&Clist=196&Elist=83820"><span style="font-weight: bold;">refused</span></a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/indiana-executes-potential-organ-donor.php">report</a>] to stay the execution of Gregory Scott Johnson, a <a href="http://www.state.in.us/judiciary/opinions/archive/030901.fsj.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">convicted murderer</span></a> [denial of post conviction relief] who hoped to give both a kidney and his liver to his sister, who suffered from hepatitis. The governor said he would have been amenable to a short delay if Johnson&#39;s donation offered &quot;a clear, demonstrated medical advantage to his sister.&quot;

Bashir, speaking to legislators Wednesday in semi-autonomous southern Sudan, said he would not &quot;deal with or respond to&quot; the ICC, according to AFP. Bashir&#39;s speech rallied support against the ICC and predicted that ICC charges against him would harm the country&#39;s oil-based economy. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jBE8ybnaWOptZLjTLga0i5aeR8TA">more</a>. <br /><br />In July, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">applied for a warrant to arrest Bashir</a> [JURIST report] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes for atrocities committed in the country&#39;s <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur region</a> [JURIST news archive].

The editor of the <em>Tribune</em> said Thursday that government censors this week warned the newspaper it would be closed by Sept. 1 if it fails to replace its editorial board, among other conditions. In a <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article28433">report</a> on its website Thursday, the newspaper said the government had barred publication of an article quoting Sudan&#39;s foreign minister as criticizing security forces for the deaths of 30 people during the raid of a Darfur refugee camp.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/handbook/2001/hb070101.htm">North Atlantic Council</a> (NAC) [NATO backgrounder], made up of representatives from 26 <a href="http://www.nato.int/">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] member nations, urged <a href="/countries/russia.php">Russia</a> [JURIST news archive] to reverse its <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iUA357W77ndvCMh32VlQqdGj53mAD92Q57EO1">recognition of the independence of two Georgian territories</a> [AP report] on Wednesday.  The representatives denounced the decision as violative of international law, and released a <a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2008/p08-108e.html">statement</a> [text] elaborating on their position: <blockquote>Russia&#39;s decision violates the many UN Security Council resolutions it has endorsed regarding Georgia&#39;s territorial integrity, and is inconsistent with the fundamental OSCE principles on which stability in Europe is based. Russia&#39;s actions have called into question its commitment to peace and security in the Caucasus. <br /><br />Georgia&#39;s recovery, security and stability are important to the Alliance. NATO calls on Russia to respect Georgia&#39;s territorial integrity and to fulfill its commitments under the six-principle agreement signed by President Saakashvili and President Medvedev.</blockquote>The NATO ambassadors&#39; statement follows similar condemnations issued<br />Tuesday by the governments of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/08/20080826-2.html">United States</a>, the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=PressS&id=5592407">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="http://w01.international.gc.ca/minpub/Publication.aspx?isRedirect=True&publication_id=386468&language=E&docnumber=184">Canada</a> [text], among other nations. US President George W. Bush called the decision <blockquote>inconsistent with numerous United Nations Security Council Resolutions that Russia has voted for in the past, and is also inconsistent with the French-brokered six-point ceasefire agreement which President Medvedev signed. ... The six-point agreement offered a peaceful way forward to resolve the conflict.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bosnian immigrant to Norway accused of mistreating Bosnian Serbs imprisoned during the <a href="http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr90/fbosnia1992.htm">1992-95 Bosnian war</a> [timeline] went on trial Wednesday in Oslo, marking the start of the first war crimes trial to take place in Norway since World War II. Norwegian citizen Mirsad Repak pleaded not guilty to war crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and torture of Serbian prisoners detained in the Dretelj detention camp in 1992. According to Repak, a former member of the Croatian Defence Forces, he was following orders from superiors. If convicted, Repak could get up to 20 years in prison. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7584983.stm">more</a>. AFP has <a href="http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=238189&version=1&template_id=39&parent_id=21">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />The government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Norway+">Norway</a> [JURIST news archive] passed <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/norway-proposes-new-laws-on-genocide.php">legislation</a> [JURIST report] in March to expand prosecutable criminal activity to include terrorism, genocide, and war crimes. Before the law was enacted, Norwegian law did not include such crimes and any criminals suspected of acts falling under those categories were handed over to international war crimes tribunals. Repak&#39;s defense argues that the newly passed legislation cannot be applied retroactively to any crimes committed in 1992, and that the laws are thus unconstitutional. According to the government, the law was passed with a specific clause permitting application of the law to war crimes committed in the past.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">British Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) Wednesday submitted requests to the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/clcs_home.htm">UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf</a> (UNCLCS) [official websites] to claim exclusive harvesting rights to an area of the seabed surrounding Ascension Island, a British possession in the remote South Atlantic technically part of St Helena, the British overseas territory that where Napoleon spent his last years in exile from 1815-21. Under the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm">Law of the Sea Treaty</a> [text], a country has exclusive harvesting rights to a zone extending 200 nautical miles from its shore, but when a continental shelf extends farther a nation may claim up to 350 miles from the baseline or 100 miles from the 2,500 meter depth. According to FCO officers Wednesday, the United Kingdom also plans to submit similar territorial claims for seabeds surrounding the Hatton-Rockall area west of Scotland, as well as the Falkland Islands, also in the southern Atlantic. Denmark and Iceland currently have pending claims to the Hatton-Rockall area, as do Argentina and Chile to the Falkland Islands. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7583353.stm">more</a>.<br /><br />Questions about Arctic sea oil and gas rights have become more pressing lately, as global warming estimates predict that previously unattainable ice-locked resources will be within reach by mid-century. New technologies also make previously unattainable under-seabed minerals extractable. In May, the five states bordering the Arctic <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/arctic-states-meeting-to-discuss.php">met to discuss allocation of harvesting rights</a> [JURIST report] to minerals under Arctic seabeds. Environmental organizations have <a href="http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/arctic/what_we_do/oil_gas/index.cfm">criticized efforts to expand oil drilling</a> [WWF report] into the Arctic Sea, calling for increased research into energy conservation and renewable resources instead. Critics have also said that offshore development will require massive amounts of infrastructure that could impact local wildlife.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] has asked federal judges in Florida and Washington, DC, to give lenient sentences to former lobbyist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> [JURIST news archive], who has cooperated in the prosecution of several legislative and executive branch officials. Since 2006, Abramoff <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/abramoff-begins-six-year-prison.php">has been serving a six-year prison term</a> [JURIST report] on fraud and conspiracy charges filed in Florida; next week, he is scheduled to be sentenced in Washington to as much as 11 years for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy. The DOJ recommended Wednesday that the Florida sentence be reduced to four years and that the Washington court impose a sentence of five years. If the judges follow those recommendations, Abramoff would be released in late 2011. His sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 4 in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website]. AP has <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/florida/AP/story/661363.html">more</a>. Politico has <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/27/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4390813.shtml">additional coverage</a>. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2008/08/justice_dept_seeks_reduced_abr.html">local coverage</a>.<br /><br />The DOJ said Abramoff&#39;s cooperation has helped secure the convictions of several former executive and legislative officials, including <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/former-doj-official-pleads-guilty-to.php">Robert Coughlin II</a>, deputy chief of staff in the DOJ Criminal Division; Deputy US Interior Secretary <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/ex-deputy-us-interior-secretary.php">J. Steven Griles</a>; US Rep. <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/former-us-congressman-guilty-in.php">Bob Ney</a> (R-OH); <a href="/paperchase/200http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif6/10/ex-white-house-official-gets-18-months.php">David Safavian</a>, former chief of staff of the US General Services Administration [JURIST reports]; and <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/former-delay-aide-pleads-guilty-to.php">Tony Rudy</a>, deputy chief of staff and press secretary to former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX). Money-laundering and conspiracy <a href="/gazette/2005/10/delay-money-laundering-indictment.php">charges</a> [indictment text] against DeLay remain pending. Last week, a Texas appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-appellate-court-refuses-to.php">allowed money-laundering indictments to stand</a> [JURIST report] against two alleged co-conspirators of DeLay.

In Beirut, investigating magistrate Samih al-Haj charged Gaddafi with inciting the abduction of <a href="http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/musa-sadr/">Imam Mussa Sadr</a> [profile], who had traveled to Tripoli to meet Libyan officials. <a href="/countries/libya.php">Libya</a> [JURIST news archive] has denied involvement in the disappearance, claiming that Sadr left the country for Italy.

AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5igesYur1xKOt67QNbEtmoLK8ZEVA">more</a>.<br /><br />The arrest warrant was issued after Gaddafi <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=44933&sectionid=351020203">failed to acknowledge a summons</a> [PressTV report] to appear at the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.lb/CP/ViewPage.aspx?id=1&language=1">Lebanese Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] for a court hearing earlier this year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Inventor Judas Klausner filed a patent infringement suit Tuesday against nine companies, including <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/">Verizon Communications</a>, and <a href="http://www.lge.com/">LG Electronics</a> [corporate websites], alleging that they infringe on his visual voicemail technology patent.  The technology involves providing a visual list of voicemail through which a user can view and retrieve individual messages.  In anticipation of Klausner&#39;s attack, Verizon brought an <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/new-york/nyedce/1:2008cv03287/283413/1/">action</a> [complaint, PDF] seeking a declaratory judgment that their proprietary visual voicemail services do not infringe on the inventor&#39;s patents. Reuters has <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/080826/voicemail_lawsuit.html?.v=2">more</a>.<br /><br />Klausner, inventor of the personal digital assistant (PDA) and the electronic organizer, has successfully brought suit for infringement against multiple telephone companies, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/voip/">voice-over-internet providers</a> (VoIP) [FCC backgrounder], and internet service providers, including AOL, Time Warner, and eBay.  Klausner <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/texas/txedce/2:2007cv00525/106920/1/">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] a similar claim against Apple Computer and AT&amp;T late last year, alleging that the technology used by Apple&#39;s iPhone infringes on the same visual voicemail patents.  The parties <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN1626330020080616">settled in July</a> [Reuters report] after the patents were licensed to Apple, but the financial details of the settlement were not disclosed. Last October, internet VoIP Vonage <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/vonage-settles-verizon-patent-lawsuit.php">settled a patent lawsuit</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://pr.vonage.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=271491">press release</a>] concerning Vonage&#39;s use of Verizon&#39;s technology.

Hu had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for carrying out counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement and organizing a counterrevolutionary group. HRIC Executive Director Sharon Hom said in a <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision%5fid=75771&item%5fid=75710">press release</a> [text]: <blockquote>We welcome the release of Hu Shigen, but it is tragic that Hu had to suffer so many years of abuse, serious health problems, and harsh conditions. He should have been released immediately in November 2005, when the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined that his detention was arbitrary.</blockquote>Hu must reportedly abide by a five-year deprivation of political rights, including those of free speech, assembly and association. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080827/D92QDS380.html">more</a>.<br /><br />A former lecturer at <a href="http://www.blcu.edu.cn/blcuweb/english/index-en.asp">Beijing Language Institute</a> [academic website], Hu helped to found the China Freedom and Democracy Party [party website] and planned events commemorating the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">1989 Tiananmen Square massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/ED64F51C802C4B62882574B00071832A/$file/0775041.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a Chinese couple are eligible for asylum because they reasonably feared persecution as members of the <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong sect</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/401268.stm">backgrounder</a>].  Zhao and Duan came to California in 2001, several months after an incident in which Chinese police had entered their home, arrested them and beaten them during a four-day detention. The couple were released after paying a fine and agreeing not to practice Falun Gong. The Ninth Circuit panel relied on Falun Gong asylum cases it had decided in <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/388/388.F3d.713.03-70930.html">2004</a> and <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/437/437.F3d.860.03-74712.html">2006</a> [opinions, PDF]. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote: <blockquote>Much like in the two previous cases, the Chinese authorities have already identified Zhao and Duan as Falun Gong adherents and have shown an interest in monitoring their movements. In fact, unlike [those cases], Zhao and Duan have already been arrested, detained for four days, physically abused, coerced into signing a promise to refrain from their practice, and ordered to report to the police once a week. Zhao was abused to the point that he sought medical attention and was threatened with death or disappearance.</blockquote> The holding reverses a determination by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [official website], which had found that that petitioners Shoufu Zhao and Zhenying Duan had shown neither past persecution nor a well-founded fear of persecution, as required by a federal <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">statute</a> [8 USC 1101(a)(42)(A) text].  The <span style="font-style:italic;">San Francisco Chronicle</span> has <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/27/BA3A12ILN8.DTL">more</a>.<br /><br /><a href="/countries/china.php">China</a> [JURIST news archive], which <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/jul/23/johngittings">banned Falun Gong</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] in 1999, has repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-human-rights-abuses-continuing-in.php">faced criticism for its human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/089/2008/en/8249b304-5724-11dd-90eb-ff4596860802/asa170892008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] detailing ongoing human rights abuses in the country, including the use of the death penalty, detention and abuse of rights activists, and Internet censorship.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] announced Tuesday that a military court had sentenced a former West Bank mayor to six years in prison after finding him guilty of belonging to and assisting the militant group <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">Hamas</a> [JURIST news archive; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8968/">backgrounder</a>]. Former Mayor Hatam Ridah Jarrar (also &quot;Grar&quot;), of the city of Jenin, was convicted last week of membership in a terrorist organization. An army statement quoted the court&#39;s sentence as saying that Jarrar had <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LQ95677.htm">used his position to aid Hamas</a> [Reuters report]. According to the statement, the court <a href="[AFP report] ">treated Jarrar&#39;s status as an orthopedic surgeon as an aggravating factor</a> [AFP report] in sentencing because he was &quot;expected to save human lives.&quot; Jarrar also must serve three years&#39; probation. Ha&#39;aretz has <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1015453.html">more</a>.<br /><br />Jarrar had spent more than two years in custody since the Israeli military <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/israel-arrests-hamas-leaders-warns-of.php">detained more than 20 Palestinian officials</a> [JURIST report] following the 2006 abduction of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=shalit">IDF Cpl.

This June, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-supreme-court-upholds-indefinite.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST report] allowing the indefinite detention of unlawful combatants suspected of belonging to terrorist groups. <a href="/countries/israel.php">Israel</a> [JURIST news archive] and Hamas have so far failed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/israel-hamas-prisoner-exchange.php">negotiate a prisoner exchange</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Followers of the Kansas-based fundamentalist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=westboro">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [JURIST news archive; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6507971.stm">report</a>] plan to stage a protest at the <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/vacancies_pr.html?pr=district&vid=16">funeral</a> [press release] for late <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=j000284">Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones</a> (D-OH) [profile] Saturday, despite a federal appeals court ruling last week that upheld an Ohio law limiting funeral protests. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] last week upheld Ohio&#39;s <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3767.30">funeral protest law</a> [text] against a constitutional challenge raised by Westboro member Shirley Phelps-Roper. Westboro church members have been going around the country picketing military funerals in recent years, claiming US soldiers have been killed because America tolerates homosexuals. Phelps-Roper claimed that the Ohio law was unconstitutionally overbroad, in violation of the First Amendment. The district court rejected Phelps-Roper&#39;s challenge, concluding that the provision was a constitutional content-neutral regulation of the time and manner of protests and that the state of Ohio has a significant interest in protecting its citizens from disruptions during funeral events. The Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0312p-06.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF], stating that the law was reasonable and that: <blockquote>Individuals mourning the loss of a loved one share a privacy right similar to individuals in their homes or individuals entering a medical facility...Unwanted intrusion during the last moments the mourners share with the deceased during a sacred ritual surely infringes upon the recognized right of survivors to mourn the deceased. Furthermore, just as a resident subjected to picketing is &#39;left with no ready means of avoiding the unwanted speech,&#39; mourners cannot easily avoid unwanted protests without sacrificing their right to partake in the funeral or burial service.</blockquote> <em>USA Today</em> has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-08-26-funeral-protests-phelps_N.htm">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, <a href="http://www.governor.ks.gov/">Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/kansas-governor-signs-new-law-banning.php">signed similar legislation</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.governor.ks.gov/news/NewsRelease/2008/nr-08-0403a.htm">press release</a>] banning protests within 150 feet of a funeral one hour before, during, and two hours after the end of a service. At least 37 other states have passed similar laws in response to the Westboro pickets, and a <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/bush-signs-bill-restricting-protests.php">federal law</a> [JURIST report] restricting protests at Arlington National Cemetery and other federal cemeteries has also been passed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge has rejected constitutional challenges to civilian charges against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=steven+green">former US Army Pvt. Steven D. Green</a> in connection with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mahmudiya">rape and killing of a 14-year-old girl</a> [JURIST news archives] and the killing of her family in Mahmudiya, Iraq (also &quot;Mahmoudiya&quot;).

Defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/mahmudiya-rape-murder-case-against-ex.php">had argued</a> [JURIST report] that Green should have been tried in the military justice system rather than charged under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> [text], which Congress amended in 2004 to permit the prosecution of US civilians who commit crimes in combat zones.

James P. Barker</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-soldier-sentenced-to-100-years-for.php">Sgt. Paul E.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Tuesday ordered the federal government to release eight more grand jury transcripts from the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/Rosenberg/RosenbergTrial.pdf">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg espionage case</a> [trial transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/trials6.htm">backgrounder</a>]. <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2794">District Judge Alvin Hellerstein</a> [official profile] emphasized the historical value of the testimony, given in 1950 and 1952 by witnesses who either did not consent to the release or could not be located. The ruling, which the government may appeal within two months, clears the way for testimony from all but three witnesses to be unsealed. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hpT--nX_AnIUoFkUqmEGtBQZ5sIgD92Q6BFO1">more</a>.

The Rosenbergs were <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_TVER.HTM">found guilty</a> [verdict transcript] in 1953 on charges of violating US <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_4.html">espionage statutes</a> [50 USC 4 materials].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Pakistani government reinstated eight judges in the <a href="http://www.sindhhighcourt.gov.pk/">Sindh High Court</a> [official website] in Karachi on Wednesday.  The judges had previously refused to take office until the reinstatement of all 60 judges <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ousted-pakistan-judges-involuntarily.php">dismissed last year</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">former President Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive], including former Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive].  Rashid Razvi, head of the Karachi bar council, <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jCjxREM_EF6vRrYBUtls9jC0lL5w">told AFP</a> [AFP report] that the appointments were a &quot;conspiracy&quot; intended to undermine support for the legal profession&#39;s <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/statements/mainfile.php/2008statements/1403/">campaign</a> [AHRC backgrounder] for total reinstatement. The Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP) reportedly plans to <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?204929">reappoint another 16 judges</a> [PakTribune.com report] in the near future. The <em>Times of India</em> has <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Pakistan/Eight_sacked_Pak_judges_reinstated/articleshow/3413219.cms">more</a>.<br /><br />On Monday, Pakistan&#39;s coalition government <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif withdrew his Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N) party over the failure to reach an agreement with the PPP to reinstate the ousted judges. Musharraf <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/musharraf-gives-up-pakistan-presidency.php">announced his resignation</a> [JURIST report] from the presidency earlier this month, largely to avoid impeachment for the judges&#39; dismissals and other alleged abuses of authority.

He is accused of inciting, ordering, or authorizing the mass killings of Tutsi civilians, as well as distributing weapons used in the massacre.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazilian intelligence service <a href="http://www.abin.gov.br/">Abin</a> [official website, in Portuguese] has pledged to investigate published reports that its agents wiretapped a variety of top Brazilian officials, including <a href="http://www.stf.gov.br/">Supreme Federal Court</a> [official website] president Gilmar Mendes. <a href="http://vejaonline.abril.com.br/notitia/servlet/newstorm.ns.presentation.NavigationServlet?publicationCode=1">Veja</a> [media website], a Brazilian weekly newsmagazine, made the claim in an <a href="http://veja.abril.com.br/030908/p_064.shtml">article</a> in its latest issue, published late last week. The officials said to have been wiretapped also include top associates of current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as well as several members of the country&#39;s Congress. Abin said in statement Saturday that Brazil&#39;s <a href="http://www.mj.gov.br/data/Pages/MJA21B014BPTBRIE.htm">Justice Ministry</a> [official website] will also investigate the claims, and news agency Agencia Brasil <a href="http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2008/08/31/materia.2008-08-31.5676301592/view">reported</a> Sunday that Menes with meet with Lula on the matter later this week.<br /><br />The <em>Veja</em> article quoted Mendes as saying he did not believe the government authorized any wiretaps on him. The reason for the alleged wiretaps remains unclear, although Brazilian media speculate that they may have been undertaken in connection with local elections seen as possible bellweathers of the chances of Lula&#39;s party in the country&#39;s 2010 presidential election. AP has <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080830/D92SRJT80.html">more</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dioceseofprovidence.org/index.php">Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence</a> [official website] reached a settlement agreement Friday with four claimants who say they were <a href="/currentawareness/clergysexabuse.php">abused by priests</a> [JURIST news archive] several decades ago and that church officials had taken steps to cover up previous allegations of abuse. Christopher Young, Donald Leighton, Marc G. Banville, and two sisters of a fourth unnamed man who has died, agreed to settle their lawsuits for a total of $1.3 million. Young, Leighton, and Banville filed their claims in 2003 after they failed to reach a settlement with the diocese in 2002, when it <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E7D61631F933A2575AC0A9649C8B63">settled</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">NY Times</span> report] the claims of 36 others who said they were victims of molestation for $13.5 million. The men alleged that they were abused by three different priests on different occasions from the 1970&#39;s through the 1980&#39;s. The Bishop of Providence, <a href="http://www.dioceseofprovidence.org/index.php?id=92">Thomas Tobin</a> [official profile], and diocese officials deny any misconduct in connection with the settlement. AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ilg-XpU7rvtWx3qbEwd152oTmBiwD92S8L8O0">more</a>.

The FCO refused to turn over the information, citing national security issues. Mohamed was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 on accusations that he conspired to assist al Qaeda in attacking civilians.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani authorities Saturday reinstated four more judges ousted from their positions in November when former President Pervez Musharraf proclaimed emergency rule. The reappointment of four judges of the <a href="http://www.lhc.gov.pk/">Lahore High Court</a> follows an announcement Wednesday that eight other judges in Sindh province were being <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-government-reappoints-8-judges.php">restored to office</a> [JURIST report]. The latest reappointments bring the total of resinstated judges to 12, out of the total of 60 superior court judges removed, including former Pakistan Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. PTI has <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/5638D0EBA7C74220652574B5003CB8E6?OpenDocument">more</a>.<br /><br />Representatives of Pakistan&#39;s lawyers&#39; movement have denounced the &quot;selective&quot; reappointments as an effort undermine their campaign for total reinstatement. Pakistan media reports claimed last week that the governing Pakistan People&#39;s Party plans to <a href="http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?204929">reappoint some 16 ousted judges</a> [PakTribune report], a move opposed by its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php">former coalition partner</a> [JURIST report], the PML-N, led by ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C07/07-40683-CR0.wpd.pdf">ruled </a>[opinion, PDF] Friday that the conviction and 210 month prison sentence of Juan Francisco Salazar, who was convicted of tampering with a witness in a drug trial, were proper. A jury found Salazar guilty of violating <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1512.html">18 USC 1512(b)(2)(A)</a> [text] after evidence was presented that he threatened to rape and kill Sarah Rolon, in order to prevent Rolon&#39;s husband, Ira Rolon, from testifying against his brothers. Ira Rolon had been indicted with Elijah and Rocky Salazar on charges of possession and distribution of methamphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine in Oklahoma, but he pleaded guilty and became a prosecution witness against the two. <br /><br />Salazar argued that the evidence against him was insufficient and that the <a href="http://www.txed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> [official website] erred in applying the sentencing guidelines under 18 USC 1512(j) when it sentenced him to almost 18 years in prison. The Court rejected that contention, saying:<blockquote>Under the manifest-miscarriage-of-justice standard, Salazar must show either that the record is &#8220;devoid of evidence of guilt&#8221; or that the evidence is &#8220;so tenuous that a conviction is shocking&#8221;... It is quite obvious that Salazar falls far short of satisfying the very narrow manifest-miscarriage-of-justice standard. Indeed, his sufficiency challenge would fail under the more lenient standard of review had he properly preserved this challenge.<br /><br />As noted, when Salazar was sentenced, ten years was the statutory maximum for a violation of &sect; 1512(b)(2)(A). In that regard, Salazar claims the district court erred by applying the penalty provisions of &sect; 1512(j) and sentencing him to 210 months&#8217; imprisonment, which he asserts was impermissibly above the above-referenced ten-year maximum. Section 1512(j), however, provides for a higher sentence...Our having held &sect; 1512(j) was properly applied by the district court in calculating Salazar&#8217;s sentence, the maximum statutory penalty Salazar faced was life imprisonment. Accordingly, his 210-month sentence did not exceed the prescribed statutory maximum and <em>Apprendi</em> is not implicated.</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=%22eighth+circuit%22">news archive</a>] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/08/08/073576P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a Minnesota school district must give a student group advocating <a href="/currentawareness/gayrights.php">gay rights</a> [JURIST news archive] the same access to school facilities as other groups. Two students belonging to Straights and Gays for Equality (SAGE) sued the <a href="http://district279.org/Welcome/">Osseo Area School District</a> [official website] under the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/4071.html">Equal Access Act</a> (EAA) [text], which prohibits secondary public schools from discriminating against student groups on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical or other content of their speech. The plaintiffs alleged that administrators at <a href="http://district279.org/sec/mgsh/">Maple Grove High School</a> (MGHS) [school website] had violated the EAA by designating SAGE as &quot;noncurricular&quot; and prohibiting it from raising money, taking field trips and using school-sponsored avenues of communication - privileges given to curriculum-related groups. The school district appealed a district court order granting a permanent injunction under which SAGE was to have &quot;the same access for meetings, avenues of communication, and other miscellaneous rights&quot; as curricular groups. Affirming the district court, <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=2948">Circuit Judge Lavenski R. Smith</a> [official profile] wrote for a three-judge panel: <blockquote>Here, MGHS does not prohibit SAGE from meeting at the school or utilizing some avenues of communication, but it limits SAGE&#39;s access to communication avenues and meeting times and places. Curricular groups receive more extensive use of school communication avenues. Thus, the issue is not whether MGHS provides SAGE access to some avenues of communication but whether it provides equal access to available avenues of communication as provided to other noncurriculum related groups. We hold that it does not. </blockquote>The court found that the district had designated some noncurricular groups, such as the school&#39;s Spirit Club, as curricular, giving them privileges denied to SAGE. Attorneys for the <a href="http://www.aclu-mn.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota</a> [advocacy website] filed the <a href="http://www.aclu-mn.org/legal/casedocket/sagevosseoareaschools.htm">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] in September 2005 and won a preliminary injunction the following year. The Eighth Circuit also <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/12/061942P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the preliminary injunction. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Minneapolis Star Tribune</span> has <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/27660649.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUq9_b9b_jEkP:QUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU">more</a>.<br /><br />In April, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0146a-06.pdf">dismissed</a> [PDF text] a <a href="http://aclu-ky.org/content/view/101/5/">lawsuit</a> [ACLU press release] brought by a Kentucky high school student over a policy prohibiting students from expressing their opposition to homosexuality and requiring them to undergo anti-harassment training. The court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-high.php">held</a> [JURIST report] 2-1 that Morrison failed to show he had been harmed by the policy prior to its repeal, or that winning the lawsuit would remedy the issue.  The school district changed the policy to exempt speech that would ordinarily be protected under the First Amendment. The ruling followed an earlier <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0431p-06.pdf">decision</a> [PDF text] by the same Sixth Circuit panel allowing the case to proceed.

A court in Tucuman province found <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DA1438F932A3575AC0A9659C8B63">Antonio Bussi</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> profile] and <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/tort/ejercito/menendez/">Luciano Menendez</a> [Project Disappeared profile and materials, in Spanish] guilty of kidnapping, torturing and murdering Guillermo Vargas Aignasse in 1976, during the coup that began a <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">seven-year military dictatorship</a> [GlobalSecurity.org backgrounder]. Prosecutor Alfredo Terraf had sought maximum penalties for both men, who were sentenced to house arrest because of their advanced age. Bussi, 82, was <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5haw7XtpQFyV4YfCIIVIQn5vxaxcQ">quoted</a> [AFP report] as telling the court that he had been &quot;politically persecuted&quot; for his role in a &quot;just and necessary war.&quot; Menendez, 81, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-life.php">received a separate life sentence</a> [JURIST report] last month when he and four others were convicted of the 1977 kidnapping, torture and killing of four political dissidents. Menendez, who commanded the secret prison called <a href="http://www.humanrights-geneva.info/Argentina-17-La-Perla-Survivors,1400">La Perla</a> [HRT backgrounder], was originally taken into custody in 2005 after a judge <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/argentina-judge-orders-former-military.php">ordered his arrest</a> [JURIST report].

In March, Argentine politician and former police chief Luis Abelardo Patti was also <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/argentina-police-arrest-former-police.php">arrested</a> for crimes allegedly committed during the period.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/PortalSCJN/">Mexican Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/NR/rdonlyres/002C5A89-E505-44D8-82C4-7CFEB4CA5629/0/PL20080828.pdf">ruled</a> [session transcript, PDF, in Spanish] that a law permitting first-trimester <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] in Mexico City does not violate the <a href="http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/1.pdf">Mexican Constitution</a> [PDF text, in Spanish]. The federal <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/">attorney general</a> and the <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official websites, in Spanish] brought a <a href="http://informa.scjn.gob.mx/">lawsuit</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/mexico-attorney-general-joins-legal.php">report</a>] last year challenging provisions of the Mexico City <a href="http://www.paot.org.mx/centro/codigos/df/pdf/cpdfn.pdf">Criminal Code</a> and <a href="http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/compi/l150187.html">Health Law</a> [PDF text, in Spanish] that allow unrestricted abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Following 17 hours of <a href="http://informa.scjn.gob.mx/audiencias_publicas.html">public hearings</a> [links to recorded video], the Supreme Court voted 8-3 to uphold the provisions. According to a court <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/PortalSCJN/MediosPub/Noticias/2008/Noticia20080828.htm">press release</a> [text, in Spanish], <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/PortalSCJN/Conoce/ConformadaScjn/Ministros/BiografiaMinistros/OrtizMayagoitiaOK.htm">Chief Justice Guillermo I. Ortiz Mayagoitia</a> [official profile, in Spanish] noted that the decision neither approves nor disapproves of abortion but rather embraces the principle that the court should not establish crimes or penalties. He said: &quot;We have determined the constitutionality of a law approved by a representative body, and in this case we have participated in a decision of great national significance.&quot; AP has <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j5dKL11swRY2dLpCzmYWd5FSGRkQD92RHQJ80">more</a>. From Mexico City, <span style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span> has <a href="http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/533591.html">local coverage</a>, in Spanish.<br /><br />Proponents of abortion rights praised the decision and predicted liberalization of abortion laws throughout <a href="/countries/mexico.php">Mexico</a> [JURIST news archive] and Latin America. Dr. Raffaela Schiavon, head of the women&#39;s rights group <a href="http://www.ipas.org/">Ipas</a> [advocacy website] in Mexico, <a href="http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/Mexican_Supreme_Court_upholds_Mexico_City_abortion_law_by_overwhelming_majority.aspx">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>This decision is of transcendental importance, not only for human rights, but as a stand for the secular state against religious fundamentalism.  It is a lesson for the future, not only for Mexico City, but for the entire country and for the whole region. </blockquote> Since Mexico City legislators <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/mexico-city-legislators-vote-to.php">passed the law</a> [JURIST report] last year, more than 12,000 women have undergone legal abortions, compared with fewer than 70 in the four years prior. Elsewhere in Latin America, the Uruguayan Senate last year also <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/uruguay-senate-votes-to-decriminalize.php">voted to decriminalize abortion</a>, while the Colombian Supreme Court in 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-legalizes.php">legalized exceptions to that nation&#39;s abortion ban</a> [JURIST reports], permitting the procedure for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or endangering a woman&#39;s health.

The judge presiding over the hearing, <a href="http://un.org/icty/officials/bonomy-e.htm">Iain Bonomy</a> [ICTY biography] entered a not-guilty plea on Karadzic&#39;s behalf.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal jury on Thursday acquitted former US Marine Sgt. <a href="http://warchronicle.com/TheyAreNotKillers/Fallujah04/DefendOurMarines.htm">Jose Luis Nazario Jr.</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nazario">news archive</a>] of voluntary manslaughter and other <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ex-marine-charged-with-voluntary.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] in the first civilian trial for crimes allegedly committed by a member of the US military in Iraq. After six hours of deliberation, a jury in <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] found Nazario not guilty of ordering his squad to shoot four unarmed Iraqi men in a house they had just searched in Fallujah in 2004. In addition to manslaughter, Nazario was <a href="http://warchronicle.com/TheyAreNotKillers/Fallujah04/070816nazariocomplaint.pdf">charged</a> [criminal complaint, PDF] with assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. Because Nazario had left the military before facing charges, he was tried in civilian court under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_212.html">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000</a> (MEJA) [text], rather than in the military justice system. The MEJA gives federal courts jurisdiction over civilians who allegedly committed crimes in combat zones while associated with the US military. Defense attorney Kevin McDermott <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJBGkERPk8ZiV1rYMiNrLa2yvSpgD92RRL201">predicted</a> [AP report] the acquittal would discourage similar prosecutions. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-marine29-2008aug29,0,5438488.story">more</a>. <br /><br />Two Marines who served with Nazario, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=weemer">Sgt. Ryan Weemer</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jermaine+nelson">Sgt. Jermaine A. Nelson</a> [JURIST news archives], have been court-martialed in connection with the Fallujah killings. Another civilian trial involving a former service member is <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-judge-sets-2009-trial-date-for.php">scheduled for April</a> [JURIST report] in Kentucky, where former Army Pfc. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=steven+green">Steven D. Green</a> [JURIST news archive] faces charges in the March 2006 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mahmudiya">rape and killing of a 14-year old Iraqi girl</a> [JURIST news archive] and the killings of her family in Mahmudiya. This week, a judge there <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/federal-court-upholds-charges-against.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that charging Green as a civilian did not violate his constitutional rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bolivian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.bo/">President Evo Morales</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3203752.stm">profile</a>] announced Thursday that a national referendum on his proposed reforms to the country&#39;s constitution will be held on December 7.  If approved, the reforms would distribute more of Bolivia&#39;s land and energy resource income to the country&#39;s indigenous population.  Morales said that a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-holds-presidential-confidence.php">national referendum</a> which permitted him to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/bolivia-president-morales-plans-to-use.php">retain his office</a> earlier this month provided the mandate for him to push for the changes, but several of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-autonomy-referendum-approved-by.php">provincial governors also confirmed</a> by the referendum <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bolivia-constitution-reforms-called.php">oppose the plan</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] and have said they will not hold the December vote in their regions. According to a Thursday <a href="javascript:popUp('prensa/Noticias.asp?id=200808281&p=5')">release</a>&nbsp;[text, in Spanish], Morales is considering an offer by the <a href="http://www.oas.org/main/english/">Organization of American States</a>&nbsp;(OAS) [official website] to mediate the conflict. AFP has <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ifX5tmEmeRYQbIrWvvXwJieltssQ">more</a>. BBC News has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7587544.stm">additional coverage</a>.<br /><br />In May, the <a href="http://www.congreso.gov.bo/indice.asp">Bolivian National Congress</a> [official website, in Spanish]&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/05/bolivia-congress-approves-confidence.php">approved the referendum</a>&nbsp;on Morales&#39; leadership, which he personally <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/bolivia-president-proposes-vote-of.php">proposed</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] last December in order to legitimize his campaign for the constitutional changes.&nbsp;In 2006, governors from six of Bolivia&#39;s nine states <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/bolivia-governors-confront-president.php">vowed to break off relations</a> with Morales following the&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2006/11/bolivia-leftist-party-gains-leverage.php">bid to give his leftist party more power</a> [JURIST reports] to rewrite the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bolivia+constitution">Bolivian constitution</a> [JURIST news archive]. A proposed national referendum on the new draft constitution, which had originally been <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/bolivia-court-halts-referendum-on-new.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report], was narrowly approved in February by the <a href="http://www.constituyente.bo/">Bolivian Constitutional Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] amid reports that Morales supporters prevented many draft opponents from entering the constitutional building to participate in the vote.
