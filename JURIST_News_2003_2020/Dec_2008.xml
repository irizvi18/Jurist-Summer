		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kazakhstan has fallen short on its pledges to reform election laws before it takes over as chair of the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website], Europe&#39;s main security and human rights body, in 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/kazakhstan1208web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Monday. The report focused on two fundamental areas of ensuring an open and free system of elections - the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and the failure of Kazakhstan to live up to its promises of reform in those areas. The report quoted the OSCE&#39;s <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/">Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights</a> (ODIHR) [official website] as saying that the elections &quot;did not meet a number of OSCE commitments, in particular with regard to elements of the legal framework and to the vote count and tabulation&quot; and &quot;interrupted an ongoing dialogue on election legislation.&quot; The report added that proposed electoral law changes sent to parliament earlier this month fail to address the fundamental problems such as term limits for the President, his unchecked powers to dissolve parliament, his ability to appoint a third of the members of the upper chamber and choose the chair and two members of the seven-member Central Election Commission.<br /><br />Some of the criticism of Kazakhstan&#39;s electoral practices has stemmed from the December 2005 election in which <a href="http://www.akorda.kz/www/www_akorda_kz.nsf/index?OpenForm&lang=en">President Nursultan Nazarbaev</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4489174.stm">profile</a>], in office since 1991, was re-elected with 91 percent of the vote. International observers <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/observers-opposition-raise-fraud.php">raised concerns of fraud</a> [JURIST report] after that poll, which opposition parties <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/kazakh-opposition-parties-challenge.php">unsuccessfully challenged</a> [JURIST report] afterwards. In August 2007 parliamentary elections the ruling party, <a href="http://www.ndp-nurotan.kz/">Nur Otan</a> [party website, in Russian], won 88 percent of the vote. Kazakhstan has never had elections considered fair and free by Western monitors.

		<title>Supreme Court rules harmless error standard applies in jury instructions case</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-544.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in a <em>per curiam</em> opinion Tuesday in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-544.html">Hedgpeth v. Pulido</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-jury-instruction.php">report</a>] that a harmless error standard should be applied when evaluating a conviction based on a general verdict where the jury was given alternate theories, including an invalid one. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] had <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/1382A73F51BACC3C882572EB004CE566/$file/0515916.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that it was a &quot;structural error,&quot; and overturned the conviction. As the case progressed, both Pulido and the state of California came to agree that it should not have been labeled as &quot;structural error,&quot; but Pulido argued that the Ninth Circuit had already engaged in the necessary harmless error analysis required by the 1993 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/507/619/">Brecht v. Abrahamson</a> [opinion text]. The Court found that no such analysis had been conducted and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, writing: <blockquote>Pulido nonetheless maintains we should affirm because the Court of Appeals effectively engaged in the <u>Brecht</u> analysis, despite its clear description of the error as &quot;structural.&quot; But despite full briefing on the applicability of <u>Brecht</u>, the Court of Appeals mentioned <u>Brecht</u> only briefly in a footnote and then went on to agree with Pulido&#39;s alternative assertion that &quot;the instructional error was structural and therefore not subject to harmless error review.&quot; The court also stated that the conviction had to be overturned unless the court was &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that the jury relied on a valid ground. Such a determination would appear to be a finding that no violation had occurred at all, rather than that any error was harmless. [citations omitted]</blockquote>All nine justices agreed that a harmless error standard should apply, but Justice John Paul Stevens issued a dissent as to the remand, in which Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined. Stevens found that the circuit court had conducted a proper harmless error analysis, writing: <blockquote>The Court of Appeals misused the term &quot;structural error&quot; in its opinion affirming the District Court&#39;s order granting Pulido&#39;s application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>. But the court&#39;s misnomer was inconsequential because its decision rested on substantially the same analysis as the District Court&#39;s, which correctly applied the standards set forth in <u>Kotteakos v. United States</u>, <u>Brecht v. Abrahamson</u>, and <u>O&#39;Neal v. McAninch</u>. [citations omitted]</blockquote>

The tribunal held that the program&#39;s seizure of white-owned farms was racially motivated and therefore contrary to the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/">Southern African Development Community</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/african/docs/other/sadc6.doc">treaty</a> [DOC text], but Zimbabwean <a href="http://www.lands.gov.zw/profiles/mutasa%27s%20profile.htm">Lands Minister Didymus Mutasa</a> [government profile] was quoted in Monday&#39;s Harare <em>Herald</em> as saying the program was justified because it corrected past racial disparities which had favored white farmers. Mutasa said the government would continue to operate the program and seize any remaining white-owned farms.<br /><br /><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3017678.stm">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Robert+Mugabe">news archive</a>] has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/21/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum">harshly criticized</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> report] for his farm program, which since 2000 has sought to redistribute white-owned land among the nation&#39;s indigenous farmers. In February 2006, Mutasa said that, following controversial constitutional reforms, there are <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">no longer any white farmers operating legally in Zimbabwe</a> [JURIST report]. Many observers attribute Zimbabwe&#39;s disastrous economic circumstances - including an inflation rate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe">exceeding 231,000,000 percent</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> report] - to the policy, under which previously productive farms have become barren under new inexperienced owners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Spanish <a href="http://www.maec.es/en/Home/Paginas/HomeEn.aspx">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] expressly allowed the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] to use Spanish resources in transporting terror suspects to Guantanamo Bay, according to a 2002 internal Foreign Ministry <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200811/30/espana/20081130elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF text, in Spanish] released by Madrid&#39;s <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/EE/UU/aviso/Aznar/paso/Espana/presos/Guantanamo/elpepuesp/20081130elpepunac_1/Tes"><span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span></a> [report, in Spanish] newspaper on Sunday. According to the document, an official for the ministry granted a CIA request to allow the US to use Spanish air space and military bases for flights between Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay. The Ministry, now under new leadership since the government of conservative Prime Minister Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Aznar was replaced in 2004 by that of socialist Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero, said it <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/wire/sns-ap-eu-spain-cia-flights,0,2692068.story">would investigate</a> [AP report] whether the country had actually granted the permission. The Spanish government has previously conceded that <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/spain-says-cia-rendition-flights-may.php">CIA flights may have stopped on its soil</a> [JURIST report], but denied that it had granted permission for such planes to transport prisoners.<br /><br />Spain made a similar <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/spain-to-investigate-secret-cia.php">pledge to investigate</a> [JURIST report] <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] flights that may have passed through the country in 2005 after the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/eu-threatens-sanctions-against-any.php">threatened it with sanctions</a> [JURIST report]. At the time, Spain denied knowledge of any such flights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President-elect Barack Obama officially <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/the_national_security_team/">announced</a> [transition materials and transcript] on Monday that he is nominating former <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] official <a href="http://www.cov.com/eholder/">Eric Holder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/obama-to-nominate-ex-deputy-ag-holder.php">report</a>] as the next US attorney general. If confirmed by the Senate, Holder will be the first African American to lead the DOJ. Holder served as Deputy Attorney General during the Clinton Administration and led Obama&#8217;s VP selection team during the election. Obama said: <blockquote>Eric Holder has the talent and commitment to succeed as Attorney General from his first day on the job, which is even more important in a transition that demands vigilance. He has distinguished himself as a prosecutor, a Judge, and a senior official, and he is deeply familiar with the law enforcement challenges we face&#8211; from terrorism to counter-intelligence; from white collar crime to public corruption.<br /><br />Eric also has the combination of toughness and independence that we need at the Justice Department. Let me be clear: the Attorney General serves the American people. And I have every expectation that Eric will protect our people, uphold the public trust, and adhere to our Constitution.</blockquote>After news of the pending nomination <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/obama-to-nominate-ex-deputy-ag-holder.php">leaked</a> [JURIST report] last month, the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/">Republican National Committee</a> [party website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/republicans-target-reported-obama-ag.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Obama&#39;s choice because of Holder&#39;s role in the pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich on the last day of the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />On Monday, Obama also announced that he has asked Robert Gates, current defense secretary, to continue in the position; James Jones, a retired Marine, to serve as national security adviser; Janet Napolitano, governor of Arizona, to be secretary of Homeland Security; and Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) to be secretary of state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President George W. Bush issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201-7.html">executive order</a> [text] on Monday that defined the primary objective of some 8600 federal agency employees to be national security-related, rendering them ineligible for <a href="http://www.flra.gov/statutes/fslmrs/fslmrs.html">Federal Labor-Management Relations Program</a> [5 U.S.C. &sect; 7101 et seq. text] coverage such as collective bargaining rights. The order says: <blockquote>The subdivisions of the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, Transportation, and the Treasury set forth in . . . this order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work. It is further determined that chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, cannot be applied to these subdivisions in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.</blockquote> Among the affected subdivisions are the <a href="http://www.atf.treas.gov/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives</a>, the Department of Energy&#39;s <a href="http://sro.srs.gov/">Savannah River Operations Office</a>, and certain offices of <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>, <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/">Customs and Border Protection</a>, <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>, <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a>, and the US <a href="http://www.uscg.mil/">Coast Guard</a> [official websites]. Of the affected federal employees, approximately 900 were affiliated with a union at the time of the order. A representative of the <a href="http://www.nteu.org/">National Treasury Employees Union</a> [advocacy website] said that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/washington/02labor.html?_r=1&ref=us">collective bargaining groups will work with the Obama administration</a> [NYT report] to overturn the order.<br /><br />Last year, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/bush-to-veto-anti-terror-bill-if-tsa.php">threatened to veto</a> [JURIST report] an anti-terror bill if provisions allowing Transportation Security Administration airport screeners to unionize were included in the final version of the bill. The Senate <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/senate-backs-limits-on-proposed-tsa.php">adopted a weakened version</a> [JURIST report] in which collective bargaining over working conditions would not extend to pay, TSA screeners would not be permitted to strike during times of emergency, and the government would be permitted to &quot;take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission during emergencies, newly imminent threats, or intelligence indicating a newly imminent emergency risk.&quot; In 2005, a federal court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/national/nationalspecial3/14secure.html">blocked</a> [NYT report] the Bush administration&#39;s personnel rules which <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/union-leaders-sue-to-block-civil.php">would have stripped all Department of Homeland Security employees</a> [JURIST report] of their collective bargaining rights.

Bikindi had been <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Bikindi/indictment/bikindi05.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in 2005 on six amended counts relating to genocide. The prosecution <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2006/495.htm">alleged</a> [ICTR press release] that Bikindi &quot;through the lyrical content of his music, consciously and deliberately assisted in executing the plan to exterminate Tutsis.&quot; While the court found that five of the six charges had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Bikindi was convicted of direct and public incitement to genocide for a 1994 speech in which he called on Hutus to rise up and exterminate the Tutsis. The court felt that a serious sanction was warranted because Bikindi had &quot;abused [his] stature as a well-known and popular artist perceived to be an influential member of the MRND and an important figure in the Interahamwe movement by using [his] influence to incite genocide.&quot; In light of this aggravating factor, the absence of any mitigating factors, and the sentencing practices of the ICTR, the court sentenced Bikindi to 15 years in prison.<br /><br />Bikindi was first indicted and arrested in 2001. At the time of his arrest, Bikindi was living in the Netherlands. He fought extradition for several months but lost and was turned over to the ICTR in March 2002 where he <a href="http://www.hirondelle.org/hirondelle.nsf/caefd9edd48f5826c12564cf004f793d/4fc571f5e3e9dd55c1256a8a00006e75?OpenDocument">pleaded not guilty</a> [Hirondelle materials] to charges of genocide.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1545.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] in part and vacated in part a ruling against <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> [corporate website], finding its patents unenforceable. The appeals court affirmed <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/broadcom0808.pdf">the decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Southern District of California</a> [official website] in <u>Qualcomm v. Broadcom</u> that held Qualcomm&#39;s patents were unenforceable because it breached its duty to report video technology-related patents to the <a href="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com16/jvt/index.html">Joint Video Team</a> [official website] standards-setting organization. The court found that by not disclosing the relevant intellectual property rights, Qualcomm was engaging in what is known as &quot;patent hold-up&quot; in an effort to prevent competitors from implementing the technology. The court also affirmed the ruling that <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> [corporate website] was entitled to the attorney fees associated with the trial. <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/judgbios.html#Prost">Judge Sharon Prost</a> [official profile] wrote: <blockquote>we agree with the district court that Qualcomm had a duty to disclose the asserted patents to the JVT, that it breached its disclosure duty, and that Broadcom was entitled to an award of attorney fees associated with the court&#8217;s exceptional case determination. </blockquote>The court vacated the lower court&#39;s judgment that essentially made Qualcomm&#39;s patents unenforceable in all cases, holding that the judgment was too broad. <br /><br />The present lawsuit began in 2005 when Qualcomm <a href="http://www.wirelessweek.com/qualcomm-sues-broadcom.aspx">filed suit</a> [<em>Wireless Week</em> report] against Broadcom in the federal court. A jury trial was held in January 2007, which resulted in an unanimous <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/27/business/NA-FIN-US-Broadcom-Qualcomm.php">verdict</a> [AP report] that Broadcom did not infringe on Qualcomm. In August 2007, the district court granted Broadcom&#39;s exceptional case motion based on the evidence and awarded Broadcom its attorney fees. Monday&#39;s ruling was the result of Qualcomm&#39;s appeal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] While general security conditions in Iraq have improved, human rights violations have continued, according to a <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/newsroom/getarticle.asp?ArticleID=885">report released</a> [press release] Tuesday by the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/default.asp">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</a> (UNAMI) [official website]. In its <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/UNAMI_Human_Rights_Report_January_June_2008_EN.pdf">13th report on the human rights situation in Iraq</a> [text, PDF], UNAMI highlighted its concern for the treatment of detainees in the country. The report, which covered the first half of this year, described the situation of minority groups, the displacement of civilians in the country, and the aspects of detention by the various authorities in Iraq, among other things. In describing the issues of detainee treatment the report said: <blockquote>The situation of detainees across the country, including in the Region of Kurdistan, remains of great concern to UNAMI, which continues to visit detention facilities and prisons under the authority of the Ministries of Interior, Justice, Defence, and Labour and Social Affairs. Many detainees have been deprived of their liberty for months or even years, often under precarious physical conditions, without access to defence counsel, or without being formally charged with a crime or produced before a judge. Continuing allegations of widespread torture and ill-treatment of inmates are of particular concern. Slow bureaucratic procedures, insufficient resources, degraded infrastructure and lack of effective accountability measures result in inordinate delays in processing detainees&#8217; cases. UNAMI also continues to observe criminal proceedings before the Central Criminal Court of Iraq and criminal courts in the Kurdistan Region. </blockquote>During a news conference held for the release of the report, the UN envoy to Iraq, Staffan de Mistura, added that he was worried about issues of prison overcrowding and said that the US would likely face a difficult task in turning over control of inmates within its control. <br /><br />Last month, Mistura <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/newsroom/getarticle.asp?ArticleID=867">praised</a> [press release; UN News Centre <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28963&Cr=Iraq&Cr1=UNAMI">report</a>] Iraq&#39;s new Independent High Commission for Human Rights (IHCHR), calling it a &quot;milestone&quot; for human rights in the region. The IHCHR was instituted by the <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/index.php?newlang=english">Iraqi Council of Representatives</a> [official website] and is mandated by the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf">Iraqi Constitution</a> [text]. The new body is to focus on civil, cultural, economic, political, and social human rights in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The head of <a href="http://www.fcsm.ru/eng/">Russia&#39;s Federal Financial Markets Service</a> (FFMS) [official website], <a href="http://www.fcsm.ru/eng/document.asp?ob_no=43366">Vladimir Milovidov</a> [official profile], said Monday that next year Russia will create new laws that <a href="http://www.fcsm.ru/eng/catalog.asp?ob_no=9147">regulate insider trading</a> [FFMS backgrounder] and establish a compensation fund for victims of investment fraud. The compensation fund is to be modeled after a program of the Russian <a href="http://www.asv.org.ru/en/">Deposit Insurance Agency</a> (DIA) [official website], which insures individual bank deposits. Milovidov&#39;s comments came as an attempt to clarify statements made earlier by Prime Minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian] to a meeting of the government presidium in which he <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/372795.htm">condemned the effect</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report] that foreign markets have on Russia&#39;s domestic share prices, but added that Russia did not want to restrict foreign investment. Also on Monday the government approved a set of draft laws that would punish the manipulation of stock prices. The laws must now go before Russia&#39;s <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] for approval. <br /><br />The FFMS was originally created in 2004 as a successor to the Federal Commission for the Securities Market (FCSM) through a decree by then-president Putin. It was given the duty of controlling and supervising activity in the financial markets, including the activity of exchanges, and issuing relevant regulations. In 2006, the FFMS had proposed laws against insider trading, but the original draft was considered inadequate. Last year Russia <a href="http://www.gaap-ifrs.com/news/gaap_ifrs/1653/">created a new division</a> [GAAP-IRFS report] within the FFMS in order to help combat insider trading, but it is unclear whether this has had any effect. Russia has two primary stock exchanges, the <a href="http://www.rts.ru/en/">RTS</a> and the <a href="http://www.micex.com/">MICEX</a> [exchange websites].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.concourt.or.th/index.html">Constitutional Court of Thailand</a> [official website, in Thai] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/topstories/topstories.php?id=135127">ordered the dissolution</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] of the ruling <a href="http://www.ppp.or.th/index.asp">People&#39;s Power Party</a> (PPP) [party website, in Thai], and banned prime minister <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2008/09/17/headlines/headlines_30083657.php">Somchai Wongsawat</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Nation</font> profile] from politics for five years as the result of an election fraud investigation. Former PPP deputy leader Yongyuth Tiyapairat was <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/090708_News/09Jul2008_news03.php">convicted of organizing a vote-buying scheme</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] by the court in July, and Thai law allows the court to disband all political parties and bar party officials associated with such fraud, even those not directly involved. The court also disbanded PPP coalition partners <a href="http://www.chartthai.or.th/">Chart Thai</a> [party website, in Thai] and Matchimathipataya and banned more than 100 other officials from participating in politics for five years. Following the ruling, Somchai said that he and the coalition parties <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_309222.html">would obey</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</font> report] the court&#39;s order. Thai deputy prime minister Chavarat Charnveerakul has been <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=135130">appointed</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Bangkok Post</font> report] as interim prime minister until the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.parliament.go.th/">parliament</a> [official website, in Thai] can appoint Somchai&#39;s sucessor. Also Tuesday, leaders of opposition <a href="http://www.padnet.net/">People&#39;s Alliance for Democracy</a> (PAD) [advocacy website] said it would <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_309395.html">end protests</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</font> report] that had <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/thailand-pm-demotes-police-chief-as.php">taken over</a> [JURIST report] Bangkok&#39;s Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang airports in light of the ruling.<br /><br />The case against the PPP and Somchai was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ag-asks-constitutional-court.php">brought before the court</a> [JURIST report] by the country&#39;s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in October following a September <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=130268">recommendation</a> [<font style="font-style: italic; ">Bangkok Post</font> report] by the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ect.go.th/thai/default.html">Election Commission</a> [official website, in Thai] to break up the party because of the alleged fraud. Thailand&#39;s Election Commission had already said it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-ruling-party-planning-to-amend.php">begin an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Somchai illegally holds stocks in companies which operate under government contracts. In September, then-prime minister and PPP founder <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7212682.stm">Samak Sundaravej</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Samak+Sundaravej">news archive</a>] instituted a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-pm-declares-state-of-emergency.php">state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] to quell demonstrations, but was later <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/thailand-high-court-ousts-pm-for.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report] after receiving illegal compensation for an appearance on a television cooking show. The PPP has also been closely associated with ousted Thai prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Thaksin+">news archive</a>], who has faced numerous charges of corruption.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA3LTEzODQtY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/07-1384-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irlbed1/1/hilite">held</a> [opinion, PDF] in <u>Associated Press v. United States Department of Justice</u> that the petition for commuted sentence of charged Taliban supporter <a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/walker/profile.html">John Walker Lindh</a> [CNN profile] falls under invasion-of-privacy exceptions to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] and may properly be closed to the public. In January 2006, the <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> (AP) [advocacy website] submitted a FOIA request to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] seeking access to Lindh&#39;s petition for commuted sentence. Lawyers for AP argued that the public interest in knowing the reasons behind his request for a shorter sentence outweighed any privacy interests he had in his records, but a judge for the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] rejected the argument and granted summary judgment in favor of the DOJ. In affirming the lower court&#39;s ruling, the appeals court judges wrote: <blockquote>AP has failed to demonstrate that disclosure of Lindh&#8217;s petition would serve a cognizable public purpose such that it may not be withheld under the privacy exemptions. The DOJ&#8217;s Supplemental Declaration states that none of the reasons Lindh poses to justify reduction of his twenty-year sentence &quot;has anything to do with any alleged Government misconduct . . . and do not reveal what the &#39;government is up to.&#39;&quot; . . . AP has not asserted that the DOJ&#8217;s declarations were made in bad faith, and has further failed to show how Lindh&#8217;s petition, containing private, personal information, would in any way shed light on the DOJ&#8217;s conduct.</blockquote> The judges further held that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by not conducting an <font style="font-style: italic;">in camera</font> document review because such review is necessary only when the justification for withholding the documents is unacceptably vague.<br /><br />Lindh, the American caught fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, pleaded guilty in 2002 to supplying services to the Taliban and agreed to a 20-year prison sentence under a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/pleaagreement.htm">plea agreement</a> [text] with prosecutors. His lawyer said that the plea agreement was the best deal possible at the time, as Lindh was not charged with any of the terrorism-related activities alleged in his <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/2ndindictment.htm">indictment</a> [text]. Lindh has petitioned US President George W. Bush three times for clemency - in <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/john-walker-lindh-asks-bush-to-commute.php">2004</a>, again in <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/lindh-makes-second-request-for.php">2005</a>, and finally in <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/american-taliban-lindh-seeks-commuted.php">2007</a> [JURIST reports] after the US government reached a more favorable plea agreement with Australian Guantanamo detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=david+hicks">David Hicks</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canada took a step towards constitutional crisis Monday as the three federal opposition parties signed a landmark <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/pdf/docs/081201_Accord_en_signed.pdf">accord</a> [text, PDF] to defeat the Conservative minority government and form a new coalition government without an intervening election. If the Conservative government is defeated in a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons that could come as early as next Monday, <a href="http://www.gg.ca/gg/bio/index_e.asp">Micha&euml;lle Jean</a> [official profile], the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.gg.ca/">Governor-General</a> [official website] and the nominal representative of the Queen, could be faced with an awkward choice between granting a likely request by Conservative Party <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] to dissolve parliament and send Canadians back to the polls just weeks after the last federal election on October 14, and using her extraordinary reserve power to accept the opposition parties&#39; offer to immediately form a new government under the leadership of Liberal Party leader <a href="http://www.thisisdion.ca/">Stephane Dion</a> [campaign website]. Dion&#39;s Liberals were drubbed in the <a href="http://enr.elections.ca/National_e.aspx">October 14 vote</a> [results], going down from 95 to 77 seats in the House of Commons. In combination with the leftist <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">New Democrats</a> and the separatist <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/">Bloc Quebecois</a> [party websites] they would, however, command a total of 163 seats, easily allowing them to outvote the 143 Conservative MPs. The crisis and the coalition deal were triggered by a Conservative <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/news08/08-095e.html">economic policy statement</a> [press release] delivered last week that offered no economic stimulus package and outlined plans to cut public funding for political parties and eliminate the right to strike for federal public servants. The Conservatives have since backed away from the latter measures and have pledged to move up the date of the next federal budget. Jean&#39;s office said Tuesday that &quot;in light of the current political situation in Canada&quot; she was <a href="http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5577">cutting short a European state visit</a> [press release] and returning to Ottawa to address the crisis. Harper and other Conservative spokesmen are challenging the coalition deal as fundamentally undemocratic and insist that the opposition parties have been given <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/2459/107749">no mandate to govern</a> [press release]. <br /><br />The last time a Canadian government was replaced without an election was in 1926. Now known as the <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004313">King-Byng affair</a> [backgrounder] the Governor-General of the time, Lord Byng, refused a request by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to call an election after King was defeated in the House, and instead called on Conservative leader Arthur Meighen to form a new government. Meighen, however, was quickly defeated in the House in turn. King won the subsequent election and afterwards pressed for a redefinition of the office of Governor-General which ended its status as agent of the British government, as opposed to the monarch. The last coalition government in Canada was formed during World War I under the leadership of Conservative Party Prime Minister Robert Borden as it struggled to push through national conscription. The so-called <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008217">Union Government</a> [backgrounder] of Conservatives and some Liberals and independents ended in 1920.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ictj.org/static/MENA/Iraq/iraq.statute.engtrans.pdf">Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal</a> [governing statute, PDF] on Tuesday sentenced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2855349.stm">Ali Hassan al-Majid</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=majid">news archive</a>], better known in the Western media as &quot;Chemical Ali,&quot; to death for his involvement in the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq during the regime of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Al-Majid was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/chemical-ali-to-face-new-genocide.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] last year with crimes against humanity for his alleged role in violence against Shiite protesters following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Al-Majid had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/chemical-ali-denies-killing-civilians.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] and argued that Shiites killed by his troops were insurgents, not civilians. The tribunal sentenced Al-Majid to death by hanging. Abdelghani Abdul Ghafor al-Ani, the head of Saddam&#39;s Baath party in southern Iraq at the time of the killings, was also sentenced to death. Several other defendants were sentenced to 15 years in prison.<br /><br />Last month, Al-Majid was one of 16 former Baath party officials to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-court-begins-new-trial-for-former.php">face trial</a> [JURIST report] for the violent suppression of a riot following the alleged assassination of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr. Al-Majid has already been sentenced to death for the killing of Kurdish Iraqis using chemical weapons during the 1988 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4877364.stm">Anfal campaign</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anfal">news archive</a>]. His death sentence in the Anfal case was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iraq-tribunal-upholds-death-sentences.php">upheld on appeal</a> last September, but Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council did not <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-approves.php">approve the execution</a> [JURIST reports] until late February. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#39;s government said in early March that al-Majid <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-pm-says-no-chemical-ali-execution.php">would not be executed</a> [JURIST report] until the Presidency Council approved the death sentences of al-Majid&#39;s two co-defendants in that case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-01-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec08.shtml#105Orig">briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/105%20Orig.pdf">Kansas v. Colorado</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether the Supreme Court must abide by Congressional rules regarding expert witness costs when the case falls under the Supreme Court&#39;s original and exclusive jurisdiction. The Court has constitutionally mandated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html#section2">original jurisdiction</a> [Article 3, &sect; 2 text] over the case because it is a dispute between two states. In 2001, the Court <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/533/1/case.html">ruled</a> [opinion] that Colorado was liable for millions of dollars in damages and interest for diverting water from the Arkansas River into Colorado farm lands. The dispute continued, and in 2004, the Court <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/543/543.US.86.105.html">ordered a special master to further investigate the situation</a> [opinion]. The special master determined that US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1821.html">law</a> [28 U.S.C. &sect; 1821(b) text] caps a witness&#39; attendance fee at $40 per day, but lawyers for Kansas have argued that the legislative intent behind the statute was meant to bind only lower courts and that the Supreme Court is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1911.html">statutorily unlimited in awarding fees</a> [28 U.S.C. &sect; 1911 text] in cases of original jurisdiction.<br /><br />The Court also heard arguments in the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-581.pdf">14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], in which the court is considering whether an employee may bring a statutory anti-discrimination suit when the employee&#39;s collective bargaining agreement prohibits such suits in favor of arbitration. In 2003, the employer of the three plaintiffs, all union members older than 50 years, changed their jobs to positions they described as less desirable. The plaintiffs alleged <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html">age discrimination</a> [Age Discrimination in Employment Act text] and brought suit with the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website], which rejected the age discrimination argument. The plaintiffs then filed suit with the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, which found that the arbitration requirement in the collective bargaining agreement was unenforceable because it deprived the plaintiffs of the right to an appropriate judicial forum. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA2LTMwNDctY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/06-3047-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://10.213.23.111:8080/isysquery/irlc779/4/hilite">affirmed the ruling</a> [text, PDF]. Lawyers for the appellants said during oral arguments that the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/about_us/overview/national_labor_relations_act.aspx">National Labor Relations Act</a> [text] allows general collective bargaining, but lawyers for the plaintiffs responded that the right of unions to bargain collectively does not trump all individual rights.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/About/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hammarberg">news archive</a>] said Monday that human rights standards have been undermined by the &quot;war on terror.&quot; Hammarberg focused on blacklists created by <a href="http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/pdf/consolidatedlist.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 1267 (1999)</a> [text, PDF], the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:344:0093:0096:EN:PDF">EU common position 2001/931</a> [text, PDF], <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:272:0011:0012:EN:PDF">EU Regulation 2580/2001</a> [text, PDF], and <a href="http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/07/st10/st10826-re01.en07.pdf">revisions made to EU Regulation 2580</a> [text, PDF]. Under these resolutions, persons suspected of involvement with terrorism can have their financial assets seized without being afforded a trial. They can submit a request for removal from the list to the UN Sanction Committee but only the country of which they are a citizen can assert any formal rights relating to the seizure. Hammarberg wrote in a <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Viewpoints/default_en.asp">column</a> [text] posted on the COE website: <blockquote>The &#39;war on terror&#39; has gravely undermined previously agreed human rights standards. The counter-terrorism measures taken since 9/11 must now be thoroughly review and changed, not only in the United States and other affected countries, but also in inter-governmental organisations [sic]. Innocent victims must have their names cleared and receive compensation and steps must be taken to prevent similar injustices in the future. Those suspected of association with terrorism must not find themselves on so-called &#39;black-lists&#39; without any prospect of having their case heard or reviewed by an independent body.</blockquote>Placements on the UN and the EU blacklists have been regularly voided by the courts. In 2006, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/index_tpi.htm">European Court of First Instance</a> [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?where=&lang=en&num=79938787T19020228&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET">annulled</a> [judgment text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/eu-court-annuls-asset-freeze-on-iran.php">report</a>] a decision by the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?lang=EN">Council of the European Union</a> [official website] that froze the assets of the <a href="http://www.iran.mojahedin.org/pagesen/index.aspx">People&#39;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran</a> (PMOI) [advocacy website]. In 2007, the same court <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/eu-court-overturns-asset-freeze-orders.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a decision to freeze the assets of the chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Jose Maria Sison and the Hamas-affiliated al-Aqsa Foundation. In January, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Council of Europe&#39;s Parliamentary Assembly</a> (PACE) [official website] called the blacklists <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/europe-rights-watchdog-slams-eu-un.php">&quot;completely arbitrary&quot;</a> [JURIST report]. In October, UN Special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights Martin Scheinin urged an <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-rights-expert-urges-overhaul-of.php">overhaul of the blacklisting system</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of <a href="http://www.admin.ch/">Switzerland</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=switzerland">news archive</a>] on Sunday announced that voters in a referendum have approved a <a href="http://www.ch.ch/abstimmungen_und_wahlen/01253/01255/01661/index.html?lang=de">measure</a> [official materials, in German] making the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.bag.admin.ch/themen/drogen/00042/00629/00798/01191/index.html?lang=en">heroin assisted treatment program</a> (HAT) [official website] permanent. <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d//pore/va//20081130/det539.html">Sixty-eight percent</a> [results, in German] of 2.26 million voters <a href="http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_SWITZERLAND_HEROIN_VOTE?SITE=NYONI&SECTION=INTERNATIONAL&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2008-11-30-17-10-18">approved the permanent legalization of heroin</a> [AP report] while voting against a <a href="http://www.ch.ch/abstimmungen_und_wahlen/01253/01255/01657/index.html?lang=de">proposal for the decriminalization of marijuana</a> [official materials, in German] by <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d//pore/va//20081130/det538.html">63.2 percent</a> [results, in German]. The key difference between the two legalization schemes was scope. The legalization of heroin is limited to 21 outpatient clinics and two prisons where distribution is tightly controlled by prescriptions and given only to addicts who have been unsuccessfully treated elsewhere. In contrast, the proposed amendment to the federal constitution <a href="http://www.parlament.ch/afs/data/d/rb/d_rb_20060106.htm">concerning marijuana</a> [Swiss Federal Assembly website, in German] would have broadly legalized the consumption, growing, and sale of cannabis for personal use. <br /><br />The HAT program began as a <a href="http://www.ispm.ch/1145.html">Swiss National Cohort Study</a> [official website] in 1994, concluding in 1996. The study showed that the lives of the addicts in treatment at government-run centers improved dramatically. The patients in the initial study moreover reduced their dependence on crime as a source of income from 70 percent to 10 percent after eighteen months. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5043766.stm">Netherlands and Germany</a> [BBC report] have initiated similar pilot studies following the Swiss success.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) on Sunday ordered the release of Ibrahim Jassam Mohammed, an Iraqi freelance photographer working for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a> [news website] held by the US military. The court order, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE4AT21D20081130?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews">supplied to a Reuters&#39; attorney</a> [Reuters report], said the US military had no evidence to support Jassam&#39;s continued imprisonment. Jassam has been held since September in a military prison near the Baghdad airport after being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL3503613">detained after a raid</a> [Reuters report] on his home in Mahmudiya.<br /><br />Press groups have called upon the US military to act more quickly when reviewing cases involving journalists covering the Iraq war. A <a href="http://www.jfoiraq.org/newsdetails.aspx?back=0&id=499">joint statement</a> [text] on Jassam&#39;s case issued in November by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Iraqi-based <a href="http://www.jfoiraq.org">Journalistic Freedom Observatory</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] noted that &quot;Since the start of the US armed intervention in Iraq in March 2003, the worldwide press freedom organisation has recorded arrests of 12 people working for Reuters, all of whom have subsequently been released and their cases closed without further action.&quot; Currently, the US has the right to hold indefinitely anyone that it deems a threat until the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">UN mandate</a> [UN press release] authorizing US presence in Iraq which expires on December 31, 2008. Last week, the Iraqi parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-parliament-passes-us-status-of.php">approved a Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [JURIST report] that limits the US military&#39;s ability to detain uncharged persons after its January 1, 2009 implementation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.diospringfield.org/index.html">Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield, Massachusetts</a> [diocesan website] <a href="http://www.iobserve.org/rn1126a.html">announced</a> [press release] Tuesday that it has settled 59 sexual abuse claims against the church through voluntary arbitration. The total amount for the settlements was $4.5 million with individual awards ranging from $5,000 to $200,000 for incidents of abuse from 1948 to 1986. Springfield bishop Timothy McDonnell said of the agreements: <blockquote>It&#39;s a terrible thing for anyone to suffer sexual abuse, but even more so for a child. The after effects impact the person&#39;s whole life. My prayer is that a small step toward healing takes place through these settlements. I apologize to all who have been hurt.</blockquote> To date, the diocese says it has paid out a total of $12.5 million to those allegedly abused by its clergy, and it says that none of the alleged abusers are still associated with the church.<br /><br />In August the <a href="http://www.dioceseofprovidence.org/index.php">Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence</a> [diocesan website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/rhode-island-catholic-diocese-reaches.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] in four abuse suits. In September 2007, the <a href="http://www.diopitt.org/">Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh</a> [diocesan website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/pittsburgh-diocese-to-settle-clergy.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the creation of a $1.25 million fund, and the <a href="http://www.diocese-sdiego.org/">Catholic Diocese of San Diego</a> [diocesan website] announced an <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/san-diego-diocese-to-settle-144-clergy.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] to pay $198.1 million to settle claims of sexual abuse by their clergy. A Los Angeles Superior Court in July 2007 approved a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/los-angeles-catholic-archdiocese.php">$660 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the <a href="http://www.la-archdiocese.org/">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles</a> [diocesan website] and plaintiffs in 508 outstanding clergy sex abuse lawsuits. In January 2007, the <a href="http://www.dioceseofspokane.org/">Catholic Diocese of Spokane</a> [diocesan website] agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/spokane-diocese-agrees-to-48m-clergy.php">settle molestation claims</a> [JURIST report] against its own priests for $48 million as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Hate crimes committed against Arab Americans have been steadily decreasing since the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], according to a <a href="http://www.adc.org/PDF/hcr07.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday by the <a href="http://www.adc.org/">American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee</a> [advocacy website]. The report found that there were 120 to 130 incidents per year  between 2003 and 2007. The report also concluded that the government has not engaged in systematic profiling in airport security, but noted that the American &quot;no-fly&quot; list contains many commonly used names which creates undue hardships for many people. Detainee abuse, delays in immigration proceedings, and provisions of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ056.107.pdf">Patriot Act</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h418eh.txt.pdf">Real ID Act</a> [text, PDF] were mentioned as continuing problems. The report also focused on negative treatment of Arab-Americans in schools and the mass-media.<br /><br />Most hate crime incidents against Arab Americans occurred in the <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E7D61F3EF931A15751C1A9679C8B63">weeks following 9/11</a> [NYT report], but animosity has persisted. The <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> [advocacy website] reported that rights-based claims by Muslims <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-muslim-rights-complaints-up-25.php">rose by 25 percent</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/us-anti-muslim-bias-incidents-spiked.php">following the trend</a> [JURIST report] from 2005. Overall hate crimes incidents in the US <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/hate-crime-reports-drop-in-2007-but.php">dropped slightly</a> [JURIST report] in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of 112 former presidents and prime ministers signed a <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/PressRelease-Letter.pdf">letter</a> [press release and text, PDF] sent to UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] on Wednesday urging him to pay a visit to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1300003.stm">Myanmar</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Myanmar">news archive</a>] before year&#39;s end to press for the release of political prisoners there. The signatories, led by former Norwegian Prime Minister and current <a href="http://www.oslocenter.no/">Oslo Center for Peace and Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] president <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/The-Government/previous-governments/the-structure-of-the-registry/ministries-and-offices/offices/prime-minister-since-1814/kjell-magne-bondevik.html?id=463473&epslanguage=EN-GB">Kjell Magne Bondevik</a> [official profile], urged Ban go to Myanmar to lend credibility to an October 2007 UN Security Council <a href="http://www.responsibilitytoprotect.org/index.php?module=uploads&func=download&fileId=447">presidential statement</a> [text, PDF] calling for the release of political prisoners being held by the military government. Saying that the release of political prisoners is &quot;a key benchmark to measure progress,&quot; the letter adds:<blockquote>If the Burmese junta continues to defy the United Nations by refusing to make these releases by the end of the year, we urge you to encourage the Security Council to take further concrete action to implement its call for the release of all political prisoners. The Burmese people are counting on the United Nations to take the required action to achieve the breakthrough they desperately need to both restore democracy to their country and address the serious humanitarian and human rights challenges that they face.</blockquote>Ban has <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14751">conditioned his visit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Irrawaddy</span> report] to Myanmar on the prospect that negotiations would achieve significant progress. Among those signatories encouraging the prisoner release are former US Presidents <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/jc39.html">Jimmy Carter</a> and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/gb41.html">George H.W. Bush</a>, former British Prime Ministers <a href="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/essential/default.asp">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <a href="http://tonyblairoffice.org/">Tony Blair</a> [official profiles], former Soviet Premier <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1990/gorbachev-bio.html">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> [Nobel profile], former Mexican President <a href="http://www.un.int/mexico/biography_fox.htm">Vicente Fox</a> [UN profile], former Japanese Prime Minister <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumiprofile/index_e.html">Junichiro Koizumi</a> [official profile], former European Commission President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/299254.stm">Romano Prodi</a> [BBC profile], and former Polish President <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1983/walesa-bio.html">Lech Wa??sa</a> [Nobel profile]. <br /><br />Ban has previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-sg-concerned-at-severe-prison-terms.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the severe sentences received by dissidents in Myanmar. A panel of UN experts led by Special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/index.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official website] has called for <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-experts-call-for-retrial-of-myanmar.php">retrials</a> [JURIST report] for dozens of activists, including leaders of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6958363.stm">88 Generation Students</a> [BBC backgrounder] movement given <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/myanmar-opposition-leaders-receive-65.php">65-year sentences</a> [JURIST report] in closed proceedings in November. Two journalists were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/myanmar-journalists-sentenced-to-prison.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison this week for possession of an earlier Special rapporteur&#39;s <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/6session/A.HRC.6.14.doc">report on Burma</a> [text, DOC]. Despite the September <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/myanmar-junta-to-release-more-than-9000.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of more than 9,000 political prisoners, human rights groups estimate that more than 2,100 Burmese remain imprisoned for their religious and political beliefs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/pages/pages_ii/iia_textenglish.html">Convention on Cluster Munitions</a> (CCM) [text; official <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/index.php">website</a>] banning the use of most such weapons was opened for signature Wednesday at a <a href="http://www.osloccm.no/hjem.cfm">conference</a> [official website] in Oslo, Norway. More than 100 countries <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nations-agree-on-cluster-bomb-draft.php">adopted the convention</a> [JURIST report] in May at a meeting in Dublin, Ireland. Several major users of cluster munitions, including the US, Russia, and China, have not adopted the convention and will not be signing. A spokesperson for the US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/dec/112561.htm">said</a> [press release] Tuesday, &quot;...a general ban on cluster munitions will put the lives of our military men and women, and those of our coalition partners, at risk.&quot; Supporters of the ban have praised the convention as a major development that will stigmatize the use of the weapons. Jakob Kellenberger, president of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList2/Home?OpenDocument">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/statement-cluster-munitions-031208?opendocument">said</a> [press release] that &quot;we have forever changed how cluster munitions will be seen by States, by the public and by history.&quot; <br /><br />Cluster bombs break apart, releasing large numbers of smaller, self-contained explosives which spread out before detonating upon impact. Their design aims to stop large-scale troop movements by maximizing bodily injury over a wide area. Bombs that fail to detonate can present a serious hazard for civilian populations. Strong supporters of the ban include the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and Australia. In May, Pope Benedict XVI <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20080518/twl-vatican-pope-weapons-diplomacy-4bdc673.html">urged</a> [AFP report] all governments to adopt the ban. Although the US did not adopt the ban, claiming it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/cluster-bomb-ban-would-impede.php">impede humanitarian efforts</a> [JURIST report] by discouraging cooperation with non-signatories, it did adopt a formal <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080709cmpolicy.pdf">policy</a> [text, PDF] on cluster munitions in June &quot;intended to minimize the potential unintended harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure.&quot;<br /><br />~12/4/08: 93 nations have signed the convention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/news_detale.php?id=5559">proposed</a> [transcript, in Russian] that Russian courts become more transparent in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. Speaking at the seventh All-Russian Congress of Judges, Medvedev <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/372830.htm">said</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] that the ECHR cannot and should not replace Russian courts. Russia is the source of more applications to the ECHR than any other country. Medvedev proposed measures to improve the quality of judges and provide broader access to court documents. He encouraged the congress to <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=13333525&PageNum=0">discuss his concerns and make concrete proposals</a> [ITAR-TASS report]. The congress meets through Thursday.<br /><br />In June, Medvedev said he was committed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-president-pledges-support-for.php">improving Russia&#39;s human rights record</a> and enforcing the rule of law, reiterating pledges he made at his <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">May inauguration</a> [JURIST reports]. Medvedev, himself a lawyer by training, promised top legal officials he would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-vows-reforms-to-rid.php">tackle corruption and intimidation in the Russian judicial system</a> [JURIST report], calling for reforms to better train and support judges. Experts have noted that corruption is rife in Russian courts, and that judges&#39; pay and status are too low to resist pressure to accept bribes. Earlier this year, Exxon Mobil CEO <a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/about_who_mgmt_rwt.aspx">Rex Tillerson</a> [corporate profile] said that there was little international confidence in Russia&#39;s judicial system, and that the country<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-judicial-process-posing-problems.php"> needs to make significant improvements</a> [JURIST report] to attract more foreign investment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Italian Judge Oscar Magi on Wednesday suspended the <em>in absentia</em> <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Italy+CIA">trial of 26 Americans</a> [JURIST news archive], most of them suspected of working for the CIA, and five former Italian intelligence officials for the 2003 abduction and <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of Egyptian cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasr+egyptian+cleric">Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive] after the government said the testimony could compromise Italy&#8217;s national security. The three-month suspension, which follows an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/italy-court-suspends-cia-rendition-case.php">postponement</a> [JURIST report] in mid-October, will enable Italy&#8217;s Constitutional Court to resolve the question of national security. Both <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] and his predecessor, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6387715.stm">former Prime Minister Romano Prodi</a> [BBC profile], have warned that testimony from intelligence agents could jeopardize future collaboration between Italian spy services and the CIA. Prosecutor Armando Spataro has accused Berlusconi, ex-Italian military intelligence agency chief Niccolo Pollari, and others of obstructing justice by refusing to let the Italian agents testify.<br /><br />Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt&#39;s State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. Defense lawyers for Pollari have said they need Italian agents&#39; testimony and classified government documents to assert their defense that Pollari was not involved in the kidnapping. Last May, Magi ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/italty-court-rules-berlusconi-can-be.php">Berlusconi can be called to testify</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Moscow Military District Court judge Yevgeny Zubov on Thursday ordered that the trial of three men accused of the murder of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya">news archive</a>] be closed to the public to hear classified evidence, limiting an <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russian-prosecutors-urge-judges.php">earlier decision to keep the proceedings open</a> [JURIST report] to the public. In November, Zubov <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-military-judge-orders-open-trial.php">ordered the trial to be open</a> [JURIST report], in accordance with the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hlE0imgWlMttDVrKcQLFLxhu9pFg">wishes of Politkovskaya&#39;s family</a> [AFP report]. Two days later, the judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-judge-closes-journalist-murder.php">ordered the trial closed</a> [JURIST report] to the public, citing jury security concerns. A juror later told a Moscow radio station that he and other jurors <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1010/42/372620.htm">did not fear for their safety</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report], and Russia&#39;s Supreme Court announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-top-court-reviewing-judge-in.php">review Zubov&#39;s decision</a> [JURIST report] to close the trial. Zubov then reopened the trial last week after <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/europe/26moscow.html">19 of 20 jurors signed a statement</a> [NYT report] confirming that they had not complained to the judge. The Russian <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Prosecutor General&#39;s Office</a> [official website, in Russian] subsequently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7747816.stm">requested that Zubov be replaced</a> [BBC report] for allegedly violating procedural rules. In blocking the public, including the news media, from entering his courtroom on Thursday, Zubov cited security concerns tied to the disclosure of classified evidence. <br /><br />Sergey Khadzhikurbanov and brothers Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, all from Chechnya, were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-charges-three-chechens-with.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the killing in August 2007. The primary suspect, Rustam Makhmudov, also from Chechnya, has yet to be captured, but Russian authorities have said he is hiding in Western Europe. Defense lawyers said last week that court documents would show that Politkovskaya&#39;s murder was <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081125/118530321.html">ordered by an unnamed Russian politician</a> [RIA Novosti report]. Politkovskaya, a reporter for the Russian newspaper <a href="http://en.novayagazeta.ru/">Novaya Gazeta</a> [official website] widely known for her stories about human rights abuses by Russian troops in Chechnya, was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/russia-top-prosecutor-probing-murder.php">murdered</a> [JURIST report] after returning to her Moscow apartment building in October 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/IZ1FG8R9.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a $156 million verdict against three US-based Islamic charities accused of aiding <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1654510.stm">Hamas</a> [BBC backgrounder, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamas">JURIST news archive</a>] in the murder of David Boim, a 17-year-old American killed in Israel in 1996. Boim&#39;s estate sued the groups - the American Muslim Society, the <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6215">Islamic Association for Palestine</a> and the <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=quranic_literacy_institute">Quaranic Literacy Institute</a> [advocacy backgrounders] - under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002333----000-.html">18 U.S.C. &sect; 2333</a> [text], which allows US nationals to bring tort claims for injuries resulting from international terrorism. The judgment had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/federal-appeals-court-overturns-156m.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by a Seventh Circuit panel, as the defendants successfully argued that their donations, purportedly earmarked for humanitarian aid, did not satisfy causation. In the rehearing en banc, the circuit disagreed with its previous decision, ruling a party is liable, regardless of specific intent toward the plaintiff, for knowing intent to aid a tortuous party. <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/posner-r/">Judge Richard Posner</a> [academic profile] wrote:<br /><blockquote>So if you give a person rocks who has told you he would like to kill drivers by dropping them on cars from an overpass, and he succeeds against the odds in killing someone by this means, you are guilty of providing material support to a murderer--for remember that when the primary violator of a statute is someone who provides assistance to another he is functionally an aider and abettor. The mental element required to fix liability on a donor to Hamas is therefore present if the donor knows the character of that organization.</blockquote>In 2004, the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] delivered its <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/judge-islamic-charities-liable-in.php">initial verdict</a> [JURIST report] against the three named defendants and two others who have since been exonerated or remanded. A jury later awarded Boim&#39;s family <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/jury-awards-156m-to-family-of-us-teen_09.php">$52 million dollars</a> [JURIST report], which was tripled in accordance with 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2333. Although the Seventh Circuit vacated and remanded the decision in December 2007, the plaintiffs successfully petitioned the court to rehear the case en banc.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a televised <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2333">address to the nation</a> [transcript; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/mrl3/8752/news/features/harper-address-081203.wmv">recorded video</a>] Wednesday evening, Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] promised to use &quot;every legal means&quot; at his disposal &quot;to protect our democracy, to protect our economy and to protect Canada&quot; on the eve of a critical meeting scheduled for 9:30 AM ET Thursday morning with <a href="http://www.gg.ca/gg/bio/index_e.asp">Governor General Michaelle Jean</a> [official profile]. Although he made no specific mention of it in his remarks, Harper is widely expected to ask Jean to prorogue the Canadian parliament until January to avoid losing a vote of confidence in the House of Commons to a putative <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/pdf/docs/081201_Accord_en_signed.pdf">coalition</a> [accord text, PDF] of two federal opposition parties supported by a third, a move which earlier this week threw the country into <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/canada-facing-constitutional-crisis.php">constitutional chaos</a> [JURIST report] at the prospect of a change in government without an intervening election. Prorogation - granting of which is within the traditional <a href="http://www.gg.ca/gg/rr/index_e.asp">powers of the governor general</a> [official backgrounder] as resident representative of the Queen, Canada&#39;s formal head of state - would mean the end of the current parliamentary session and the death of all government bills in progress. Speaking directly to Canadians, and noting that his minority government had just been returned to power in a federal election on <a href="http://enr.elections.ca/National_e.aspx">October 14</a> [election results], Harper castigated the coalition to be led by Liberal Party chief <a href="http://www.thisisdion.ca/">Stephane Dion</a> [campaign website] in association with the leftist <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">New Democratic Party</a> supported by the <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/">Bloc Quebecois</a> [party websites]:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Opposition is attempting to impose this deal without your say, without your consent, and without your vote. This is no time for backroom deals with the separatists; it is the time for Canada&#8217;s government to focus on the economy...</BLOCKQUOTE> Harper said that when parliament resumed he would be offering a new federal budget addressing issues that the opposition parties had flagged in the government&#39;s <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/news08/08-095e.html">economic statement</a> [press release] earlier this month which immediately precipitated the coalition talks. <br /><br />In <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/story_15516_e.aspx">remarks</a> [transcript] responding to Harper&#39;s speech, Dion said:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Harper Conservatives have lost the confidence of the majority of Members of the House of Commons. In our democracy, in our parliamentary system, in our Constitution, this means that they have lost the right to govern.</BLOCKQUOTE>Speculating on Harper&#39;s likely request to the governor general, he added: <BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Harper&#8217;s solution is to extend that crisis by avoiding a simple vote. By suspending Parliament and continuing the confusion. We offer a better way. We say settle it now and let&#8217;s get to work on the people&#8217;s business. A vote is scheduled for next Monday. Let it proceed...<br /><br />Earlier today I wrote Her Excellency the Governor General. I respectfully asked her to refuse any request by the Prime Minister to suspend Parliament until he has demonstrated to her that he still commands the confidence of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>Read Dion&#39;s <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/pdf/docs/081203_excellency_en.pdf">letter to the governor general</a> [PDF text].<br /><br />Jean returned to Canada Wednesday afternoon after cutting short a European state visit. A Canadian governor general has never refused a prorogation request from a prime minister, but no prime minister has ever asked for prorogation in a bid to avoid defeat in the House of Commons. Canadian constitutional experts say such a refusal would be within the rights of the governor general under the office&#39;s reserve power, and that at that point she has the option of either accepting the offer of the opposition parties to form a new government, or dissolving parliament and calling a new federal election. In either event Harper would resign as prime minister. The last time a Canadian governor general called on the federal opposition to form a new national government without an election was in 1926, during the so-called <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0004313">King-Byng Affair</a> [backgrounder]. The only true coalition government in Canadian federal history was led by Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden towards the end of World War I when the country faced a crisis over conscription. The so-called <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008217">Union Government</a> [backgrounder] of Conservatives and some Liberals and independents ended in 1920.

Briefing the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] on the situation in Darfur, Ocampo urged members to ensure there is no political and financial support for those subject to arrest for crimes or for those protecting them. He said: <blockquote>An indicted person travelling on the territory of an UN member State should be arrested and surrendered to the Court. There is no immunity on account of rank or official position for those identified by the judges of the International Criminal Court as responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide.</blockquote>Ocampo insisted that full cooperation by all states was essential for the success of all the court&#39;s activities in the matter.<br /><br />In June, the Security Council issued a short presidential statement <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/sudan-must-work-with-icc-on-darfur.php">urging Sudan to work with the ICC</a> [JURIST report] to &quot;put an end to impunity for the crimes committed in Darfur.&quot; Sudan is not a party to the ICC, but must cooperate to fulfill its obligations under <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm">Council Resolution 1593</a> [text], which established jurisdiction over the Darfur situation. Hundreds of thousands of people have allegedly been killed in Darfur by Sudanese military and <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2104210/">janjaweed</a> [Slate backgrounder] militia forces. In July, Ocampo applied for an <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Bashir on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities committed in the country&#8217;s Darfur region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] approved <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-284.htm">rule amendments</a> [SEC press release] Wednesday that provide greater oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies. The rule amendments, which were passed to strengthen the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ291.109.pdf">Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], will effect ratings agencies including <a href="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.siteselection/site_selection/0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.html">Standard and Poor&#39;s</a> and <a href="http://www.moodys.com/cust/default.asp">Moody&#39;s</a> [corporate websites], who provide graded analysis of the credit-worthiness of corporations and other entities. The <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/nrsrofactsheet-120308.htm">rule amendments</a> [SEC fact sheet] include additional disclosure requirements which must be provided by ratings agencies concerning their ratings analyses, more stringent record-keeping requirements, and heightened conflict of interest rules. In comments made after the SEC approved the new rules, SEC <a href="http://sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Chairman Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] <a href="http://sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch120308cc.htm">said</a> [speech text]:<blockquote>Earlier this year the SEC publicly released our findings from an extensive 10-month examination of the three major credit rating agencies that uncovered significant weaknesses in their ratings practices for mortgage-backed securities and that called into question the impartiality of their ratings. The SEC last summer proposed comprehensive reforms to regulate the conflicts of interests, disclosures, internal policies, and business practices of credit rating agencies. The proposed rules addressed conflicts of interest and required new disclosures designed to increase the transparency and accountability of credit rating agencies. <br /><br />Today, after taking into account the many comments the agency has received, and revising the proposals to address practical concerns that were brought to our attention through this public notice and comment procedure, we are prepared to issue final rules. These new rules will promote the goals of the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 of improving ratings quality for the protection of investors and in the public interest by fostering accountability, transparency, and competition in the credit rating agency industry.</blockquote>The rule amendments come after the SEC released the <a href="http://sec.gov/news/studies/2008/craexamination070808.pdf">results</a> [report, PDF; SEC <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-135.htm">press release</a>] in July of a 10-month probe into the failures of credit rating agencies to adequately protect shareholders during the global <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=financial+crisis">financial crisis</a> [JURIST news report].<br /><br />The SEC has been actively investigating certain sectors of the US financial industry in the wake of the financial crisis and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">$700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report] passed in September. In early October, the SEC began an <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sec-begins-accounting-rules-review-as.php">agency review of financial accounting procedures</a> [JURIST report], including &quot;<a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-234.htm">mark-to-market</a>&quot; [SEC backgrounder] rules. Later in October, SEC Chairman Cox <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/regulatory-gaps-need-to-be-fixed-sec.php">testified before a Congressional committee</a> [JURIST report], stating that the credit crisis demonstrates the need for greater regulation of credit default swaps and investment banking.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] lawyers on Tuesday filed a <a href="http://www.caaflog.com-a.googlepages.com/Gray--U.S.reconmotion.pdf">challenge</a> [motion, PDF] to a federal judge&#39;s decision to stay the execution of convicted murder suspect US Army private Ronald Gray. Judge Richard Rogers for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> last week <a href="http://www.caaflog.com-a.googlepages.com/Grayorder.pdf">ordered the stay</a> [order, PDF] of the execution, which had been scheduled for December 10, in order to give Gray the opportunity to challenge his sentence. Lawyers for Gray sought the stay, <a href="http://www.caaflog.com-a.googlepages.com/Grayopptorecon.htm">arguing</a> [motion text] that they could not make appeals based on changes in the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text] since Gray&#39;s conviction until after President George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/bush-approves-first-us-military.php">approved his execution</a> [JURIST report] in July. DOJ lawyers objected to the stay, arguing that his defense has had ample opportunity to file appeals on his behalf.<br /><br />Gray&#39;s execution was the first military execution to be approved by a president <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/us/29execute.html?_r=1&ref=us">since 1961</a> [NYT report]. Gray was first tried by a civilian court for his connection to four murders and eight rapes in North Carolina in the mid-1980s. He pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and five counts of rape, and the court sentenced him to life in prison. Gray was then sentenced to death for murder and rape by a court-martial panel in 1988, a military sentence that requires presidential approval under the UCMJ. Gray later appealed his court-martial sentence, but the Court of Appeals for the Armed Services <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/1999Term/93-7001.htm">rejected Gray&#39;s appeal</a> [opinion text] in 1999, and the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/osg/briefs/2000/0responses/2000-0607.resp.pdf">denied <font style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</font></a> [government Supreme Court brief, PDF] in 2001.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST news archive] on Tuesday temporarily <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-05-01-08-304-ENG.pdf">postponed</a> [decision, PDF] proceedings against former <a href="/countries/congo.php">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [JURIST news archive] rebel leader <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/RCA/c0108.html">Jean-Pierre Bemba</a> [ICC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bemba">news archive</a>] because another member of the pre-trial chamber was granted a leave of absence due to &quot;grave family circumstances.&quot; The absence of a member of the chamber left an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/452.html">insufficient number of judges</a> [ICC press release] on the panel to successfully confirm the charges against Bemba. Proceedings in the case will resume after a meeting of the parties ordered for January 12, 2009.<br /><br />Bemba, who was originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-congo-rebel-leader-arrested-in.php">arrested by Belgian authorities</a> [JURIST report] in May, was arraigned [JURIST report] at the ICC on war crimes and crimes against humanity charges in July. Bemba has been <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/ICC-01-05-01-08-1-FRA.pdf">charged</a> [arrest warrant, PDF, in French] with war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1067518.stm">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [BBC backgrounder] between October 2002 and March 2003. ICC prosecutors say he is responsible for rape, torture, outrages upon personal dignity, and pillaging. Bemba&#39;s arrest warrant is the first issued by the ICC in its investigation of <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/371.html">large-scale sexual offenses</a> [ICC press release] in the CAR. Bemba, now a member of the Congolese Senate, was elected to office after losing a <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/congo-election-panel-announces-run-off.php">run-off presidential election</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1123006.stm">Joseph Kabila</a> [BBC profile], who in December 2006 became the first freely-elected president of the DRC since 1960. After the election, Bemba&#39;s private militia force led a violent campaign against government troops until the DRC Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-high-court-dismisses.php">rejected his election challenge</a> [JURIST report]. In the process, Bemba&#39;s supporters <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/congo-supreme-court-building-set.php">set fire to the Supreme Court building</a> [JURIST report]. Following the clashes, the chief prosecutor of the DRC <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/congo-chief-prosecutor-orders-arrest-of.php">issued a warrant for Bemba&#39;s arrest</a> [JURIST report], and he fled to Europe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-03-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec08.shtml#105Orig">briefs</a>] Wednesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1216.pdf">Philip Morris USA v. Williams</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court considered for a third time a $79.5 million punitive damages verdict against <a href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/home.asp">Philip Morris USA</a> [corporate website]. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/supreme-court-overturns-philip-morris.php">previously ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the punitive damages award based &quot;in part on [a jury&#39;s] desire to <em>punish</em> the defendant for harming persons who are not before the court&quot; amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. On remand, the <a href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of Oregon</a> [official website] again <a href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S051805.htm">upheld</a> [opinion text] the verdict, finding that it did not need to reach the federal constitutional issue if there was &quot;an independent and adequate&quot; basis in state law for upholding the verdict. Counsel for petitioner Philip Morris argued that &quot;the Oregon court failed to follow this Court&#39;s directions on remand and . . . the ground it gave is not adequate to show a forfeiture of due process rights.&quot; Counsel for respondent argued, &quot;This Court&#39;s constitutional mandate in this case is conditioned in several significant respects, and it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court that&#39;s applying it.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-10374.pdf">Haywood v. Drown</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] the Court heard arguments on whether a state&#8217;s withdrawal of jurisdiction over certain damages claims against state corrections employees may be constitutionally applied to exclude federal claims under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">USC Section 1983</a> [text], especially when the state legislature withdrew jurisdiction because it concluded that permitting such lawsuits is bad policy. Petitioner Haywood brought two section 1983 suits against corrections employees. The trial court dismissed both cases, finding his lawsuits were barred by <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&BROWSER=EXPLORER+&LIST=LAW+&TOKEN=00823353+&TARGET=VIEW+&QUERYDATA=$$COR24$$@TXCOR026">New York Correction Law &sect; 24</a> [text], which prevents state trial courts from hearing claims for money damages against prison employees whether based on federal or state law. Both the intermediate appellate court and the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/">Court of Appeals of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/decisions/nov07/146opn07.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF]. Counsel for petitioner argued that the <BLOCKQUOTE>statute relegates Mr. Haywood and anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983 to either bring their case in Federal court or to accept what the New York legislature has deemed a State law alternative. That State law alternative does not allow Mr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his civil rights; instead he can only sue the State.</BLOCKQUOTE> Counsel for the state of New York acknowledged that &quot;The Federal Constitution permits State courts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a State to hear them so long as the State does not discriminate against Federal claims in comparison with similar State claims. New York&#39;s statute fully satisfies that requirement.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=19&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=16748458&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text] unanimously Tuesday that <a href="http://www.government.fi/etusivu/en.jsp">Finland</a> [official website] violated Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] - the &quot;right to respect for private and family life&quot; - in a case involving a minor targeted by pedophiles. In <u>K.U. v. Finland</u> (application no. 2872/02), the court found that Finnish authorities failed to provide a legal framework to protect the applicant&#39;s rights when his privacy was invaded by a personal ad with sexual connotations that was posted on the Internet without his knowledge. The applicant was 12 years old at the time of the incident in 1999. The court <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=2872/02&sessionid=16748523&skin=hudoc-pr-en">said</a> [press release] that at the time the incident occurred, the Finnish legislature should have already identified the need and provided a legal &quot;framework for reconciling the confidentiality of Internet services with the prevention of disorder or crime&quot; so that that there would have been a legal basis for the <a href="http://www.oikeus.fi/6061.htm">Helsinki District Court</a> [official website, in Finnish] to oblige the Internet service provider to identify the culprit. Within the next three months from the date of the judgment, Finnish authorities may request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, but such requests are only granted in exceptional cases that raise a serious question affecting the interpretation or application of the convention or its protocols.<br /><br />The Finnish legislature subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2003/en20030460.pdf">Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media Act</a> [unofficial translation, PDF] that now provides a remedy to victims of Internet crime, but it was not in effect at the time of the incident. After the district court declined to oblige the Internet service provider to identify the user, the case was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of Finland declined to hear the case. The case was filed with the ECHR in January 2002, but was not declared admissible until June 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Tuesday <a href="/pdf/roadlessorder.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that her 2006 <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/library/legal_docs/opinion-9-20-06_roadless.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-reinstates-ban-against.php">report</a>] invalidating a 2005 Bush administration <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/m-05/fr-05132005-state-petition.html?WAISdocID=989013494036+121+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">rule</a> [text] that would allow road construction and mining in national forests applies only to 10 western states. The original <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/">Roadless Area Conservation Rule</a> [Forest Service backgrounder], implemented by former US President Bill Clinton in 2001, was <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/new-rule-allows-road-construction-on.php">replaced</a> [JURIST report] by the Bush administration with a rule allowing governors to request that regulations on the management of roadless areas be developed to meet the needs of individual states. Under the 2006 ruling by Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], the reinstated Clinton-era rule would have prohibited mining, logging, and road construction in the forests of 38 states and Puerto Rico, totaling more than 58 million acres of land. In August another federal judge <a href="/pdf/roadlessrulingaugust.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Clinton-era rule was invalid. The Bush administration asked that the two conflicting decisions be reconciled, so Laporte amended her 2006 decision to apply to only 10 western states. The <a href="http://wilderness.org/">Wilderness Society</a> [advocacy website], a plaintiff in the original case, has <a href="http://wilderness.org/content/13-million-acres-roadless-forests">called on</a> [press release] the Bush administration &quot;to refrain from using a decision by a federal judge [Tuesday] as an excuse to knock down protection for an estimated 13.6 million acres of roadless national forests in 29 states.&quot; Cases are currently pending in federal courts in San Francisco and Denver, and the incoming Obama administration could also make changes to the rule.<br /><br />In her 2006 decision, Laporte found in favor of 20 environmental groups and California, Washington, New Mexico, and Oregon, which <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/state-ags-challenge-bush.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">US Forest Service</a> [official website]. Attorneys for <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/index.html">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy group] representing the environmental groups in the case <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/news/press/006/court-reinstates-roadless-rule.html">praised the decision</a> [press release], but members of the timber industry and other opponents criticized the ruling, saying states should be able to manage their own forests by using citizen opinion polls.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA0LTI2NDMtY3Jfb3BuLnBkZg==/04-2643-cr_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl1f25/4/hilite">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that a suspected Osama bin Laden associate, imprisoned for 32 years after stabbing a prison guard while in custody, may be resentenced according to heightened standards for acts of terrorism. Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, a Sudanese national, was in custody in 2000 awaiting charges related to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/regions/africa/kenya_tanzania.html">1998 bombing of two US embassies</a> [State Department backgrounder] in Tanzania and Kenya when he attacked a prison guard and rendered him partially blind and paralyzed. Following the attack, Salim pleaded guilty to <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001114----000-.html">attempted murder</a> and <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001117----000-.html">conspiracy to murder</a> a federal official [18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1114 and 1117 text] and was sentenced to 32 years in prison. The government argued that the district court should have imposed a longer sentence according to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/2008guid/GL2008.pdf">enhanced sentencing guidelines for acts of terrorism</a> [US Sentencing Guidelines &sect; 3A1.4, PDF]. The Second Circuit agreed, rejecting the district court&#39;s contention that the crime could not be considered terrorism because it did not transcend national boundaries. The appeals court held that the terrorism enhancement does not require transnational conduct, stating that &quot;Congress could have defined &#39;Federal crime of terrorism&#39; to include a requirement that the offense conduct transcend national boundaries, but it did not.&quot; Salim will now be resentenced according to the judgment, though defense lawyers indicated that they may appeal the decision.<br /><br />Salim still faces trial for his alleged role in planning the 1998 embassy bombings. Last week, the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/second-circuit-upholds-convictions-in.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of three men related to the attacks. In March, the US also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/guantanamo-detainee-charged-in-1998-us.php">charged</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080328ghailani1.pdf">charge sheet</a>, PDF] Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3938267.stm">Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani</a> [BBC profile] with several terrorism-related counts for his alleged involvement in the bombings. Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/kenya-drops-charges-against-three-for.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 against three other men connected with the attack in Nairobi that killed 224 people.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-02-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec08.shtml#105Orig">briefs</a>] Tuesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-588.pdf">Entergy Corp. v. EPA</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether Section 316(b) of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> [text, PDF] authorizes the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] to use a cost-benefit analysis to determine what is the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact from cooling water intake structures that draw water into power plants to offset the heat created during power generation. This case consolidates issues in two cases - <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-589.htm">PSEG Fossil v. Riverkeeper</a> (07-589) [docket], and <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/07-597.htm">Utility Water Act Group v. Riverkeeper</a> (07-597) [docket]. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA0LTY2OTItYWdfb3BuLnBkZg==/04-6692-ag_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl5b70/1/hilite">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that no such balancing test may be used and that companies must adopt the best technology available. Counsel for the petitioners argued that the circuit court decision unlawfully limits EPA authority and that a cost-benefit analysis is required. Counsel for the respondents argued that the &quot;EPA never has the authority, in any context, to weigh costs against benefits&quot; and that no &quot;absurd circumstances&quot; would result from such a ruling.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1125.pdf">Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleIX.htm">Title IX</a> [text] precludes <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">Section 1983</a> [text] constitutional claims to remedy sex discrimination in educational settings. The <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=06-2596.01A">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that parents could not sue for discrimination against their daughter by another student under Section 1983 and that Title IX provided the only remedy. Counsel for the petitioners argued that &quot;the court of appeals entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of congressional intent: The statutory text, the statutory background structure and evolution, the unquestioned legislative purpose&quot; in finding that Title IX precluded a remedy under Section 1983. Counsel for the respondent argued that &quot;Title IX provides for sex discrimination and provides a remedy for sex discrimination in a broader category of circumstances than the Equal Protection Clause,&quot; so petitioners are not denied a remedy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Norwegian court on Tuesday <a href="http://www.domstol.no/DAtemplates/Article____20585.aspx?epslanguage=NO">sentenced</a> [press release, in Norwegian] Bosnian immigrant Mirsad Repak to five years in prison for committing war crimes against 11 Serbian citizens imprisoned during the Bosnian War. Repak, who has lived Norway for more than 10 years, was also ordered to pay damages to the families of eight Serbian victims, but was acquitted on the charges of rape and crimes against humanity. Repak was the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/norway-trial-begins-for-bosnian-croat.php">first person to be tried on war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/norway-proposes-new-laws-on-genocide.php">new Norwegian legislation</a> [JURIST report] that was enacted in March that outlawed war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was also the first to be tried on war crimes in Norway since World War II. <br /><br />The case raised a constitutional question concerning whether the new legislation could be applied retroactively. A provision of the <a href="http://www.stortinget.no/en/In-English/About-the-Storting/The-Constitution/The-Constitution/">Norwegian Constitution</a> [text] specifically prohibits the retroactive application of any law, unless a similar law could be found to exist prior to the inclusion of a new law. The court reasoned that the new law against war crimes was essentially similar to the older penal provision that prohibited crimes against personal freedom. The Oslo District Court acquitted Repak of crimes against humanity because it could find no prior law to apply.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=16778850&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text] Thursday that the British practice of keeping the fingerprints and DNA profiles of people arrested but not convicted of crimes was against privacy rights and should not continue. The suit was originally brought by UK nationals Michael Marper and a juvenile named as &quot;S,&quot; both of whom were arrested for crimes in 2001 and never convicted. When they later requested that their DNA and fingerprint profile be destroyed they were turned down. Their appeal was <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldjudgmt/jd040722/york-1.htm">dismissed</a> [judgment text] in 2004 by the UK&#39;s highest court, the House of Lords. The ECHR held that the practice of retaining the material <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=30562/04%20%7C%2030566/04&sessionid=16779021&skin=hudoc-pr-en">violated</a> [press release] Article 8 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [text], which requires respect for private and family life. The court awarded the applicants &#8364;42,000, less &#8364;2,613.07 already paid in legal aid. The UK cannot appeal the ruling, and they were given a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jdfBB7l652sSisvXnS_3dz1lblrwD94RSD0G0">deadline</a> [AP report] of March to plan a new practice for future DNA collection and to propose a plan for destroying the existing 4.5 million sample <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/using-science/dna-database/">database</a> [official website]. UK leaders can agree to destroy the entire database, or make a case for keeping certain individual samples.<br /><br />In November, the House of Lords ruled that the DNA database rules needed to be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/05/lord_dna_database/">amended</a> [The <em>Register</em> report] to allow those not convicted to have their profiles deleted. That decision, along with the human rights court ruling, come just months after a proponent of the database called for it to be <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/uk-judge-says-all-citizens-and-visitors.php">expanded</a> [JURIST report] to include all citizens and visitors of the country. The Home Office has <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uk-government-says-no-plans-to-create.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] any plans to create such a database.

The <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1043992.html">raid lasted an hour</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report], with resistance by the settlers, and there were reports that five settlers were injured as well as two police officers. The police took the settlers by surprise, arriving at the house in the mid-afternoon rather than at dawn when they were expected. Further violence occurred in surrounding areas with shootings and violent confrontations between Jewish West bank Settlers, Israeli military and police forces, and Palestinians late into Thursday night, despite increased police and military presence.<br /><br />Ownership of the house is disputed by Israeli settlers and the original purchaser of the house, New York-based businessman Morris Abraham, and the original Palestinian owner of the house who denies the sale. The transaction was never approved by Israel&#39;s minister of defense, a necessary component of a lawful transaction. On Friday, Riyad al-Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hlU7SDe1CnYMLgKqDeXByRSeSpogD94SHLU00">appealed to foreign diplomats</a> [AP report] and requesting international intervention. Hebron is in close proximity to one of the holiest places of worship in the Jewish faith, the Cave of the Patriarchs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] Thursday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=1200/03&sessionid=16800202&skin=hudoc-pr-en">ruled on six Chechnya disappearance cases</a> [press release], ordering Russia to pay a total of &#8364;320,000 to the relatives of the victims. In each case, the applicants, all Russian nationals, alleged their relatives disappeared between 2001-2003 after being taken into custody by members of the Russian military and that domestic authorities did not carry out adequate investigations of their claims. The applicants relied on Articles 2, 3, 5, and 13 - the right to life, the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty and security, and the right to an effective remedy - of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The court found that in each of the six cases that Russia failed to carry out adequate criminal investigations into the disappearances.<br /><br />The ECHR has consistently ruled against Russia in cases involving human rights violations in Chechnya. In October, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">issued two decisions</a> [JURIST report] finding Russia in violation of the human rights convention in several cases concerning the deaths or abductions of Russian nationals in Chechnya in 2000. In May, the court ruled that Russia was responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">disappearance of a dozen people</a> [JURIST report] during Russian armed raids in Chechnya in 2002 and 2003. In July 2007, the court ruled that Russian authorities were responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/echr-rules-russia-responsible-for.php">shooting deaths of 11 unarmed Chechen civilians</a>, and in June 2007 it held that Russian authorities were liable for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/russia-responsible-for-chechen-deaths.php">2003 deaths of four Chechen family members</a> [JURIST reports]. On Wednesday, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/news_detale.php?id=5559">proposed</a> [transcript, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">report</a>] that Russian courts become more transparent in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the ECHR.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] sought to prohibit government censorship of prisoners&#39; testimony about alleged torture and abuse at <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/usavksm_motion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] filed Friday in military commission proceedings against five <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=high+value+detainees">&quot;high value detainees&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] accused of involvement in the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. The motion says observers at the proceedings watch on a closed-circuit video monitor with a 20-second delay, allowing officials to cut the feed when it appears a defendant is discussing the conditions of their detention. In the motion, the ACLU requests that: <blockquote>(1) in all future proceedings, the government not be permitted to exclude trial observers from hearing those portions of proceedings in which the defendants relate their allegations of abuse in U.S. custody; and (2) with respect to all prior proceedings, this Military Commission order the release of unredacted transcripts that include those portions in which the audio was turned off.</blockquote> &quot;There is absolutely no justification for the suppression of detainees&#39; allegations of torture and abuse,&quot; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/37996prs20081205.html?s_src=RSS">said</a> [press release] Ben Wizner, staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project.<br /><br />In October, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-sides-with-dod-on-foia.php">granted summary judgment</a> [JURIST report] for the Department of Defense, holding that unredacted transcripts allegedly containing evidence of torture used against the high-value detainees held at Guantanamo Bay could be withheld from the ACLU.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.montanacourts.org/dcourt/default.asp#1">Montana First Judicial District</a> [Montana courts materials] ruled Friday that terminally ill patients in the state have the right to commit physician-assisted suicide. The case, <a href="http://zoommakesitzoom.com/documents/Baxter%20complaint.pdf">Baxter v. Montana</a> [complaint, PDF] was brought by a number of terminally-ill Montanans, their doctors, and <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/">Compassion &amp; Choices</a> [advocacy website], an organization supporting the legalization of physician assisted suicide. In their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that their right to assisted suicide was guaranteed by the <a href="http://data.opi.state.mt.us/bills/mca_toc/Constition.htm">Montana Constitution</a> [text; <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/documents/KT_MTLawReview.pdf">analysis</a>, PDF], specifically under provisions relating to their rights of privacy, individual dignity, due process, equal protection, and the right to seek safety, health and happiness in all lawful ways. In her opinion, Judge Dorothy McCarter <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_nRfzfSMZ4LFV570Fm8_RnCrhyQD94TGH4G1">held</a> [AP report] that under the Montana Constitution, terminally ill individuals have the right to die with dignity, and have the right to obtain self-administered medications to hasten death if they find their suffering to be unbearable. McCarter also held that physicians prescribing those medications are protected from homicide prosecution by state protection of the patient&#39;s right to die.<br /><br />Last month, voters in Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/washington-supports-lethal.php">approved a ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] that will allow terminally ill, legally competent adults to obtain lethal prescriptions without exposing themselves, their physicians, or others to criminal penalties. The Washington measure is modeled on neighboring Oregon&#39;s <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/index.shtml">Death with Dignity Act</a> [official materials], enacted in 1997 and <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court in 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kenyan government on Friday published a bill calling for a constitutional amendment allowing the replacement of the controversial <a href="http://www.eck.or.ke/">Electoral Commission of Kenya</a> [official website] which oversaw the re-election of <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] in December 2007, leading to massive demonstrations and more than 1,000 deaths. Justice Minister Martha Karua said the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=136&art_id=nw20081205142619899C535633">parliament could pass the bill within a week</a> [AFP report], laying the groundwork for an interim body of five people to replace the current 22-member commission. The commission has called the claim <a href="http://en.afrik.com/article14990.html">unconstitutional</a> [Afrik.com report] and is seeking a court order to block such a change.

In March, Kibaki <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-president-appoints-commission-to.php">established a panel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the violence that followed the election.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7136556.stm">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] Friday signed into law legislation authorizing the creation of a DNA database for convicted criminals, according to reports. Under the law, <a href="http://www.kommersant.com/p-13607/r_530/genetic_database_crime/">passed by the State Duma</a> [<em>Kommersant</em> report] on November 19 and approved by the Council of Federation on November 26, authorities are allowed to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5igYgQNE5wdTUBTT8JS590wlmn5HgD94SMDE02">collect and retain DNA</a> [AP report] from prisoners convicted of serious violent crimes, including murder and rape. The new legislation is expected to draw opposition from rights groups and advocates, who claim that the database is an invasion of privacy.<br /><br />A number of other countries have instituted similar criminal DNA databases. In April, the US Department of Justice announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-expanding-dna-data-collection-to-all.php">begin collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] from every person arrested under federal laws. The UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/using-science/dna-database/">National DNA Database</a> [Home Office backgrounder] collects and retains DNA information from criminal suspects upon their arrest. The European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled Thursday that the British practice of keeping the fingerprints and DNA profiles of people arrested but not convicted of crimes was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-rules-uk-dna-database.php">against privacy rights</a> [JURIST report] and should not continue. In 2005, the government of Sweden <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/sweden-to-propose-law-authorizing-dna.php">proposed a law</a> [JURIST report] that would establish a program similar to the UK scheme, authorizing the collection of DNA from criminal suspects, but under the Swedish scheme samples are destroyed upon acquittal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/index.html">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has indicted five <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">news archive</a>] guards involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">September 2007 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report], according to reports. The Associated Press reported that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jtLfZVVNZF72Pzftxt21yza9lVwAD94SEREG0">sealed indictments</a> [AP report] were issued Thursday, and will remain sealed until at least Monday. While the indictments had been expected to contain charges under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> (MEJA) [text], the <em>New York Times</em> says the five indicted Blackwater guards will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/washington/06blackwater.html?_r=1&hp">charged</a> [NYT report] under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d100:HR05210:|TOM:/bss/d100query.html|">Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988</a> [LOC backgrounder], which requires a minimum 30-year sentence for the use of a machine gun in connection with a crime. If the guards are indicted under the MEJA, it would mark the first time that State Department contractors were prosecuted under the law, which allows criminal charges to be filed against contractors working for the Department of Defense.<br /><br />The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. In November, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/middleeast/14blackwater.html?ex=1195707600&en=5cc8ef55f3b5b4bd&ei=5065&partner=MYWAY"><span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span></a> and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/14/AR2007111400222.html?nav=rss_world"><span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span></a> [reports] reported that an Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report], and last month Bush administration officials announced that Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">security contractors would be losing immunity</a> from Iraqi law under the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">recently approved</a> [JURIST reports] US Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Iraq. <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/08115-usls-psc-final.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in January asserting that existing federal law is sufficient to prosecute private contractors using excessive violence in their overseas capacities, and that the US government is to blame for failing to &quot;develop a clear policy with respect to the accountability of private contractors for crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot; The report says that the MEJA could be extended to State Department contractors, but that the US has failed to do so.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072926p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/37994prs20081205.html">press release</a>] that an Egyptian Christian who could face torture in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] may challenge his deportation from the United States. <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants/gen/35805res20020307.html">Sameh Khouzam</a> [ACLU materials; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Khouzam">news archive</a>] fled to the US in 1998 allegedly to escape religious persecution. <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] lawyers representing Khouzam <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-court-urged-to-block.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] before the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] that the US government was not abiding by its obligations under the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] by relying on assurances from the Egyptian government that Khouzam would not be tortured if he were returned to authorities in Egypt [JURIST news archive]. In upholding the district court&#39;s <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/opinions/vanaskie/07v992.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-judge-blocks-deportation-of.php">report</a>] to block Khouzam&#39;s deportation, Judge Marjorie Rendell wrote: <blockquote>The alien must have an opportunity to present, before a neutral and impartial decisionmaker, evidence and arguments challenging the reliability of diplomatic assurances proffered by the Government, and the Government&#8217;s compliance with the relevant regulations. The alien must also be afforded an individualized determination of the matter based on a record disclosed to the alien.</blockquote>The court held that the district court had no jurisdiction over Khouzam&#8217;s petition for a writ of <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span>, and vacated the order granting that petition. The court also held that they had jurisdiction over Khouzam&#8217;s petition for review, and that Khouzam was denied due process. They granted his petition for review, and vacated the termination of his deferral of removal.<br /><br />Khouzam originally came to the US seeking asylum, but was detained by US authorities based on claims by Egyptian authorities that he was a murder suspect in his home country. Khouzam&#39;s case marks the first time a US court has addressed whether the government can lawfully rely on assurances from foreign governments to deport detainees to countries with a record of engaging in torture. Friday&#39;s decision could have important ramifications in the upcoming case of <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/arar-v.-ashcroft">Arar v. Ashcroft</a> [CCR backgrounder] that <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-to-reconsider-arar.php">will be argued</a> before an en banc sitting of the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] next week. In that case, Canadian citizen <a href="http://www.maherarar.ca/">Maher Arar</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=arar">news archive</a>] is seeking a declaratory judgment against US government officials for deporting him to <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> [JURIST news archive], where he was tortured <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1121-08.htm">despite Syrian assurances</a> [<em>Globe &amp; Mail</em> report]. In April this year the Court of Appeal in London <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocked two separate orders</a> [JURIST report] to extradite two terror suspects to Libya and another convicted terrorist to Jordan, citing concerns that they would face torture and be denied a fair trial on arrival despite the fact that the UK had signed agreements with both countries under which they had guaranteed that deportees would not face abuse on their return. The court ruled that those agreements, <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/uk-libya-sign-agreement-on-treatment.php">much maligned by rights groups</a> [JURIST report], were insufficient.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] on Friday gave first reading to a bill that would ban jury trials for terrorism, espionage, and treason, among other crimes. In a <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/05/europe/EU-Russia-Jury-Trials.php">vote of 351 to 34</a> [AP report] with no abstentions, the lower house of parliament approved the bill that proponents call necessary as a result of <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/372915.htm">lenient jurors</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Moscow Times</span> report]. Opponents fear that the new law could be used to punish opposition leaders. The bill must now be presented for two more readings before being sent to the upper house of parliament, and finally to President Dmitry Medvedev.<br /><br />In February, a panel of jurists reported that Russia&#39;s anti-terrorism laws were leading to <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-panel-says-russian-anti-terror.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report]. In 2006, the Russian government <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/putin-signs-russia-anti-terror-bill.php">passed laws</a> [JURIST report] giving Russian police and military broad authority to tap telephone conversations and control electronic communications in the vicinity of counter-terror operations, shoot down hijacked planes threatening public places or strategic facilities, and deal with the aftermath of terrorist attacks.

The case involves Qatari national <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/ali_saleh_kahlah_al_marri/index.html">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-marri">news archive</a>] who has been held since 2003 solely on the basis of a presidential declaration that he is an &quot;enemy combatant.&quot; The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in July <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/067427A.P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds.php">report</a>] the president&#39;s authority to order al-Marri&#39;s detention. The incoming administration of <a href="http://change.gov/">President-elect Barack Obama</a> [transition website] will have the power to change the Bush administration&#39;s policy, potentially ending the case before a ruling by the Court by releasing or charging al-Marri.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-441.htm"><u>Gross v.

The case involves an executive who claims he was passed over for a promotion in favor of a younger employee in violation of the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</a> (ADEA) [text]. In 2003, the Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-679.ZS.html">Desert Palace v.

Ahmidan, who was in custody at the time of the attack, was convicted of providing support to the bombers, but had earlier been acquitted of charges of belonging to a terrorist organization. Prosecutors in the case had sought a sentence of 20 years, and lawyers for Ahmidan have said they <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iX9LHdQwTW0rvAib7C2gK5osHrng">will appeal the ruling</a> [AFP report]. Ahmidan is currently serving five years in prison for drug trafficking charges.<br /><br />In January, Moroccan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/morocco-to-put-alleged-2004-madrid.php">arrested and pledged to try</a> [JURIST report] another Moroccan, Abdelilah Hriz, for alleged involvement in the bombings, but Spain has handled the majority of prosecutions thusfar. In November 2007, victims <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/madrid-train-bombings-victims-plan.php">vowed to appeal</a> [JURIST report] after a Spanish court acquitted seven of the 28 co-defendants accused of participating in the attacks, including alleged mastermind <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/warwithoutborders/suspect.html">Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed</a> [CBC profile]. In all, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4899544.stm">28 co-defendants</a> [BBC backgrounder] were charged in Spain with 192 counts of murder and upwards of 1,800 counts of attempted murder related to the March 11, 2004 bombings. Three defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/spain-court-issues-guilty-verdicts-in.php">convicted of murder</a> [JURIST report] and 18 others were found guilty of lesser charges. The three men convicted of murder - Jamel Zougam, Otman el Ghanoui, and Emilio Trashorras - each received sentences of up to 40,000 years imprisonment, but under Spanish law can only serve a maximum of 40 years each.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] unanimously <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=5&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=16860063&skin=hudoc-pr-en">ruled</a> [press release] Thursday that there was no human rights violation when a French school expelled two students for refusing to remove their <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3328277.stm">headscarves</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=headscarf+OR+headscarves">news archive</a>]. Two French nationals, <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=26&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=16860109&skin=hudoc-en">Belgin Dogru</a> [judgment text] and <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=31645/04&sessionid=16860121&skin=hudoc-en">Esma-Nur Kervanci</a> [judgment text, in French], were expelled from school in 1999 at ages 11 and 12, respectively, when they refused to remove their headscarves for physical education classes. After the girls were unsuccessful in the French court system, they brought their claim to the human rights court. The applicants sought relief under Article 9 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text], which provides for freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. The court ruled that there was no violation, reasoning in the Dogru case: <blockquote>The Court considers that . . . the penalty of expulsion does not appear disproportionate, and notes that the applicant was able to continue her schooling by correspondence classes. It can be seen that the applicant&#39;s religious convictions were fully taken into account in relation to the requirements of protecting the rights and freedoms of others and public order. It is also clear that the decision complained of was based on those requirements and not on any objections to the applicant&#39;s religious beliefs.</blockquote>Religious headscarves have been banned in schools in several European countries. In 2004, France <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/french-headscarf-ban-will-take-effect.htm">banned religious clothing and symbols in public schools</a> [JURIST report]. A German court has <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-state-court-upholds-teacher.php">upheld a similar ban</a> [JURIST report]. The Danish government <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/denmark-government-to-propose-headscarf.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] in May to prohibit judges from wearing religious headscarves, and the Dutch government <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dutch-government-outlines-plan-to-ban.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] in September to ban burqas in school.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two US congressman on Thursday sent a <a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ny08_nadler/ConyersNadlerQuestionAGTerrorProbes_120408.html">letter</a> [text] to US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Michael Mukasey</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mukasey">news archive</a>], calling on him to explain comments he made Wednesday about pardoning US counterterrorism officials for their controversial policies. Mukasey <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/us/04justice.html?_r=1">told reporters</a> [NYT report] at a news conference that he did not see a need to issue a blanket pardon because there was no evidence that anyone who developed controversial interrogation, eavesdropping or other controversial policies did so under the belief they were acting illegally. Representatives <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers</a> (D-MI) [official website] and <a href="http://www.house.gov/nadler/">Jerrold Nadler</a> (D-NY) [official website] wrote: <blockquote>[W]e are troubled by the breadth of your statement and the blanket conclusion that everyone involved in approving these policies believed they were acting within the law. The public record reflects ample warning to Administration officials that its legal approach was overreaching and invalid, such as repeated objections by military lawyers to Department legal opinions on interrogation issues and the stark warning by then-Deputy Attorney General Comey that the Department would be &quot;ashamed&quot; if the world learned of the legal advice it had given on torture issues. . . . Accordingly, please explain the basis for your blanket conclusion that all Department actors believed their conduct in counterterrorism matters was lawful. </blockquote>Also Thursday, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGAMR511532008&lang=e&rss=recentnews">statement</a> [press release] expressing its concern over Mukasey&#39;s statements and calling for accountability for abuses committed during the &quot;war on terror.&quot;<br /><br />Mukasey has previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/mukasey-defends-government-lawyers-who.php">defended government lawyers</a> [JURIST report] who wrote memos on the legality of harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, emphasizing the legal complexity of the issues raised in the memos and criticizing the <a href="/forumy/2008/05/prosecute-lawyers-too.php">vilification of the authors</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In January testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mukasey <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/mukasey-refuses-to-pass-judgment-on.php">refused to pass judgment</a> on waterboarding, and in February, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">refused to launch an investigation</a> [JURIST reports] into its use.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/index_tpi.htm">European Court of First Instance</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=european+court+first+instance">news archive</a>] on Thursday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=en&Submit=Rechercher&alldocs=alldocs&docj=docj&docop=docop&docor=docor&docjo=docjo&numaff=T-284/08&datefs=&datefe=&nomusuel=&domaine=&mots=&resmax=100">annulled</a> [case materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp08/aff/cp080084en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] a July decision of the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=242&lang=EN&mode=g">Council of the European Union</a> [official website] to place the <a href="http://www.english.mojahedin.org/pagesEn/index.aspx">People&#8217;s Mojahedin Organization of Iran</a> (PMOI) [group website] on the list of terrorist organizations and freeze its assets for the third time since the court&#39;s similar decision in December 2006. The court recognized as valid four of the six <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:236:0016:0016:EN:PDF">pleas</a> [text, PDF] made by the PMOI. In an unusually swift ruling only a day after the hearing, the court found that the Council had violated the PMOI&#8217;s right to defend itself from the Council&#8217;s legal arguments to place it on the European list of terrorist organizations by failing to give the specific reason for its decision to the PMOI and subsequently to the court. This constituted both a &quot;failure to discharge burden of proof&quot; and a &quot;breach of the applicant&#8217;s right to effective judicial protection.&quot; In addition, PMOI was awarded costs under Article 87 (2) of the <a href="http://www.ena.lu/rules_procedure_council_european_union_15_september_2006-020007631.html">Rules of Procedure</a> [text]. The court did not specify a date by which the Council must comply with its decision, and any appeals must be made within two months.<br /><br />In <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/europe-court-annuls-asset-freeze-of.php">October 2008</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/eu-court-annuls-asset-freeze-on-iran.php">December 2006</a> [JURIST reports] the European Court of First Instance struck down similar decisions by the Council in regards to the PMOI. The PMOI is considered the main organization in the <a href="http://www.ncr-iran.org/">National Council of Resistance of Iran</a> [advocacy website], a coalition based in France that purports to be dedicated to a democratic, secular, and coalition government in Iran.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for former Chadian dictator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5140818.stm">Hissene Habre</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=habre">news archive</a>] filed a complaint with the court of the <a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website] in October to prevent his trial for crimes against humanity in Senegal from moving forward, according to an AFP <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/081203/world/senegal_chad_justice_habre">report</a>. The move is a response to 14 Chadian and Senegalese citizens <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/senegal-14-file-war-crimes-complaints.php">filing complaints with a Senegal prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] in September alleging war crimes and torture by the former dictator. Habre, who has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990, fled to Senegal after being overthrown in 1990. Senegal is expected to respond to Habre&#39;s petition in order to keep the trial moving as expected.<br /><br />In August, a Chadian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced Habre to death <em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report] for crimes committed against the state. Senegal courts have <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">long refused to extradite Habre</a>, despite the issuance of an <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/belgium-issues-international-arrest.php">international arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] by Belgium pursuant to its <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2003/07/31/belgium-universal-jurisdiction-law-repealed">universal jurisdiction laws</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Under growing international pressure either to try Habre locally or extradite him to Belgium, <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/institutions/president_bio.html">Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/684035.stm">profile</a>] agreed in April 2006 to try him in Senegal and the Senegalese government later <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-chad-president-facing-crimes-trial.php">determined</a> [JURIST report] he would face charges in a criminal court, rather than in front of a special tribunal. Previously the Senegalese courts <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2001/04/22/united-nations-asks-senegal-hold-ex-chad-dictator">dismissed an action against him in 2001</a> [HRW report], claiming that they lacked jurisdiction over crimes committed elsewhere. In July this year Senegal formally <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senegal-adopts-constitutional-amendment.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional amendment giving the nation&#39;s courts jurisdiction over Habre&#39;s trial.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi presidential council on Thursday approved a <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/56116.html">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [draft text; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] that sets a 2011 deadline for the withdraw of US troops but also approved an additional law calling for a national referendum on the pact in July 2009. The approval of the council, comprising <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4415531.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile] and two vice presidents, was the final step required before the SOFA can go into effect on January 1, 2009, a day after the current <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">UN mandate</a> [UN press release] authorizing the US presence in Iraq expires.<br /><br />The SOFA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-cabinet-approves-us-status-of.php">approved by the Iraq cabinet</a> in November, and then by the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-parliament-passes-us-status-of.php">Iraq parliament</a> [JURIST reports] last week. In addition to the official deadlines for troop withdraw, it gives Iraqi courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">limited jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over American military personnel and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">eliminates immunity</a> [JURIST report] for US defense contractors working within Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://www.gg.ca/gg/bio/index_e.asp">Governor General Michaelle Jean</a> [official profile] Thursday morning granted a request by <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] to suspend the Canadian parliament until January, heading off for the moment a constitutional crisis that might have been triggered if she had invited a <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/pdf/docs/081201_Accord_en_signed.pdf">coalition</a> [accord text, PDF] of opposition parties to form a new government without an intervening election. Prorogation was granted despite the fact that the Harper government was facing likely defeat in the House next Monday in a no-confidence vote. In remarks at Rideau Hall after his meeting with the governor general, Harper said that his first priority after parliament meets again on January 26 will be to introduce a new federal budget. A heavily-criticized government <a href="http://www.fin.gc.ca/news08/08-095e.html">economic statement</a> [press release] earlier this month precipitated the coalition talks. Defeat of the government by the opposition in January remains a possibility, however.<br /><br />In a televised <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2333">address to the nation</a> [transcript; <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/mrl3/8752/news/features/harper-address-081203.wmv">recorded video</a>] Wednesday evening, Harper had promised to use &quot;every legal means&quot; at his disposal &quot;to protect our democracy, to protect our economy and to protect Canada&quot;, noting that his minority government had just been returned to power in a federal election on <a href="http://enr.elections.ca/National_e.aspx">October 14</a> [election results]. Jean returned to Canada Wednesday afternoon after cutting short a European state visit. A Canadian governor general has never refused a prorogation request from a prime minister, but no prime minister has ever asked for prorogation in a bid to avoid defeat in the House of Commons.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Dong Da district court in Vietnam on Monday convicted eight Catholics of disturbing public order and destroying property during protests over disputed land, but gave them light sentences, letting them all go free. Seven defendants received <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/08/asia/viet.php">suspended sentences of 12-15 months</a> [AP report], and the remaining defendant received a warning. The defendants, who <a href="http://www.vietcatholic.net/News/Html/61825.htm">denied all government allegations</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">VietCatholic</span> report], were arrested last August during demonstrations at the Thai Ha church in Hanoi. More than 1,000 Catholics who showed up to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4B70Q720081208">protest the trial</a> [Reuters report] Monday <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=10689&icid=4&d_str=20081208">cheered</a> [The <em>Standard</em> report] as the defendants were set free.<br /><br />In August, hundreds of Catholics gathered at the Thai Ha church to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7593251.stm">demand return of the land</a> [BBC report]. Protesters broke down a wall and set up an altar. Hanoi officials claim the land belongs to the city because it was lawfully turned over to them in the early 1960s. Church authorities claim the land is rightfully theirs. Protests also took place this year at the former Vatican Embassy in Vietnam. The embassy was closed after the Communists took power in 1954. In January, the Vietnamese government said it would <a href="http://www.thanhniennews.com/print.php?catid=1&newsid=35362">resolve all land disputes according to Vietnamese property law</a> [<em>Thanhnien</em> report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian government commission is examining the legality of the Soviet Union&#39;s pre-World War II artwork sales, an official from the <a href="http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/index.html">State Hermitage Museum</a> [official website] said on Tuesday. Museum director Mikhail Piotrovsky said in his St. Petersburg state-of-the-museum report that Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] has commissioned the group to investigate whether the sales were legal under the laws at the time. The museum has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=acTIud_U45tQ&refer=muse">no plans</a> [Bloomberg report] to attempt to recover or demand return of any artwork, regardless of the commission&#39;s findings, but instead plans to use the information uncovered to defend against attempts by the German government and the Russian Orthodox Church to recover artwork from Russia.  Piotrovsky explained that museum&#39;s <a href="http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29742/russia-investigating-legality-of-government-art-sales-in-the-1920s/">goal</a> [ArtInfo report] is to keep all artwork in the collections where it currently sits. <br /><br />Hundreds of paintings were confiscated from private owners and churches by the Bolsheviks after they took power in 1917 and were nationalized and sold in the 1920s and early 1930s. Twenty of these paintings eventually helped create the US <a href="http://www.nga.gov/">National Gallery of Art</a> [official website], in Washington, DC. Among those sold was Raphael&#39;s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Alba Madonna</span> (1511), bought in 1931 by then-US Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, who purchased and donated all of the works now displayed in the National Gallery. Many other paintings were destroyed or placed in state museums like the State Hermitage Museum.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human rights conditions are worsening in 12 Arab nations, according to a <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/Images/ArticleFiles/Original/301.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF, in Arabic; <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/Images/ArticleFiles/Original/302.pdf">synopsis</a>, PDF] published Friday by the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/english/default.aspx">Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies</a> (CIHRS) [advocacy website]. The publication, which is the group&#39;s <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/English/NewsSystem/Articles/548 ">first annual report</a> [press release], is titled &quot;From Exporting Terrorism to Exporting Repression,&quot; and was released to coincide with the <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/udhr60/">60th Anniversary</a> [anniversary website] of the <a href="http://un.org/Overview/rights.html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. The report deplores the impunity of human rights violations and crimes, including violations against political, human rights, and reform activists in the region, focusing on Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Yemen. The report identifies Iraq as the nation with the most serious human rights abuses. It charges that authoritarian tendencies in the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/english/level1_en.jsp?level1_id=1">League of Arab States</a> [official website] have risen to an all time high, and that foreign relations of the league amount to a tool of repression. It also alleges that there is a lack of independence and guarantees of justice in the region&#39;s judicial systems. The report concludes that most Arab regimes are losing their legitimacy because they refuse to base themselves on free democratic choice and are instead allying with <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-salafi.htm">Salafi Islam</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], signifying a move towards religious extremism and worsening human rights conditions.<br /><br />Iraq has previously been reported as having a poor human rights record. In March, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called the human rights situation in Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-human-rights-situation-disastrous.php">&quot;disastrous&quot;</a> [JURIST report]. In June, the <a href="http://www.refugees.org/home.aspx">US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants</a> [advocacy website] declared Iraq to be one of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ngo-names-worst-violators-of-refugee.php">worst violators of refugee rights</a> [JURIST report] in the world. Last month, the UN envoy to Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/new-iraq-human-rights-commission.php">praised the creation of an Independent High Commission for Human Rights</a> [JURIST report], calling it a &quot;milestone&quot; for human rights in the region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> on Monday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/asavchertoff.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/exclusion/38023prs20081208.html?s_src=RSS">press release</a>] that it has the authority to review a decision by the US consulate in South Africa that denied a visa to a controversial South African scholar. The consulate had denied a nonimmigrant visa to <a href="http://www.ukzn.ac.za/ccs/default.asp?10,24,8,49">Adam Habib</a> [academic backgrounder], a Muslim scholar, political analyst, and professor, citing his alleged involvement with terroristic activities, which prevented him from accepting speaking engagements in the US. The organizations that had invited Habib to speak <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/habib_complaint_20070925.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/aclu-challenges-us-exclusion-of-south.php">report</a>] US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/biography_0116.shtm">Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chertoff">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CONDOLEEZZA+RICE">news archive</a>] in their professional capacities for First Amendment violations. Under the US Supreme Court&#39;s 1972 decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/408/753/case.html">Kleindienst v. Mandel</a> [opinion text] the Executive&#39;s power to exclude an alien is not reviewable if the decision was made &quot;on the basis of a facially legitimate and bona fide reason.&quot; The district court found that the State Department lacked any such reason, making the decision reviewable. The court did not go so far as to grant the plaintiffs&#39; request for summary judgment in their favor. The court further found that Chertoff and Habib were improperly included as parties in the suit and dismissed them.<br /><br />In 2006, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aclu-challenges-patriot-act-provision.php">brought a similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the US for denying Swiss Muslim scholar <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/23588res20060124.html">Tariq Ramadan</a> [ACLU profile] entry into the US under the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/exclusion/index.html">ideological exclusion provision</a> [ACLU backgrounder; CIS <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back1005.html">report</a>] of the <a href="/currentawareness/patriot.php">Patriot Act</a> [JURIST news archive]. Ramadan was unable to accept speaking invitations at various functions and a teaching invitation at the University of Notre Dame in 2004 after his visa was revoked. That case is currently pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-09-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec08.shtml#105Orig">briefs</a>] Tuesday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1122.pdf">Arizona v. Johnson</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether the Fourth Amendment permits a police officer to search a vehicle passenger during a routine traffic stop if he believes that suspect may be armed and dangerous but has no justifiable reason to believe that a crime is being committed. In this case, Johnson, a passenger in a car, was frisked during a traffic stop. The officer suspected Johnson of gang affiliation, and upon pat-down she discovered a handgun and marijuana. At trial, Johnson was convicted of possession of the gun and marijuana, but the <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals Division Two</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/Decisions/cr20060079opn.pdf">overturned his conviction</a> [opinion, PDF], finding that the evidence should have been excluded under the Fourth Amendment. Counsel for the state of Arizona argued that &quot;Fourth Amendment searches must be reasonable, and the pat down in this case was reasonable.&quot; Counsel for the respondent argued that the Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0392_0001_ZO.html">Terry v. Ohio</a> [opinion text] requires a &quot;reasonable suspicion that crime is afoot&quot; and no reasonable suspicion of a crime was present.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1114.pdf">Cone v. Bell</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments in a case brought by a Tennessee death row inmate who alleges that authorities hid mitigating evidence during his murder trial. The issues are whether a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> claim is &quot;procedurally defaulted&quot; because it has been presented twice to the state court and whether a federal <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> court is powerless to recognize that a state court erred in holding that state law precludes reviewing a claim. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0227p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] against the petitioner Cone, finding &quot;If the state court decides the petitioner&#39;s claims on an adequate and independent state ground, such as a state procedural rule, the petitioner&#39;s claims are considered procedurally defaulted and he is barred from seeking federal habeas relief.&quot; Counsel for Cone argued that the Court should reverse the ruling that the claim is procedurally defaulted and remand for a proper ruling on the merits. Counsel for the respondent argued that Cone&#39;s claim has already been properly rejected by the state court on the merits.

Leahy, who heads the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website], met privately with Holder on Monday.

EULEX is a civilian mission under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) replacing the <a href="http://www.unmikonline.org/">United Nations Mission in Kosovo</a> (UNMIK) [official website]. EULEX will assist and support <a href="/countries/kosovo.php">Kosovo</a> [JURIST news archive] authorities in the areas of police, judiciary, and customs. Approximately 1,400 internationals, including more than 1,000 police officers and an additional 500 local support staff are being deployed. A spokesperson for the US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/dec/112994.htm">said</a> Tuesday that the US is &quot;committed to EULEX&#39;s mission to strengthen rule of law institutions throughout Kosovo to the benefit of all communities, and to promote Kosovo&#39;s territorial integrity and stability in the region.&quot; The hope is that EULEX will help <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=12&dd=09&nav_id=55602">resolve ongoing conflicts</a> [B92 report] between ethnic Albanians and Serbs and stabilize local government.<br /><br />Kosovo controversially <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">seceded from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] in February, and its new <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in June. Although Serbia now accepts EULEX, both Serbia and traditional ally Russia initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/russia-slams-eu-for-planned-kosovo.php">condemned it</a> [JURIST report] as illegal. Russia previously rejected Kosovo&#39;s declaration of independence from Serbia, warning that such unilateral action without the approval of the UN sets a dangerous precedent for &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; around the world.

They have both been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the Senate seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama and obtaining illegal campaign contributions. They are also <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/source-feds-take-gov-blagojevich-into-custody.html">accused</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] of threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Both men were taken into federal custody early Tuesday morning and are scheduled to appear before a federal magistrate later in the day. <br /><br />Former Illinois Governor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=george+ryan">George Ryan</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-illinois-governor-sentenced-to.php">sentenced last year</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/former-illinois-governor-heads-to.php">jailed</a> [JURIST reports] on corruption charges. Ryan&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/ex-illinois-governor-heading-to-trial.php">trial</a> began in 2005, and in 2006 a jury found him <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/breaking-news-former-illinois-governor.php">guilty</a> [JURIST reports] on multiple counts of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2003/warner_ryan.pdf">corruption and fraud</a> [indictment, PDF] in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred during Ryan&#39;s term as Illinois Secretary of State. Ryan made national headlines and won praise in some quarters in January 2003 when, just before leaving office, he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/11/illinois.death.row/">commuted the executions</a> [CNN report; <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/ssection/deathpenalty/speech.html">speech transcript</a>] of all Illinois inmates then on death row.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge in Utah ruled Monday that five indicted <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">news archive</a>] guards involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">September 2007 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] must report to a DC court. Lawyers for the five guards tried to move the proceedings to Utah, where one of the guards lives, but a federal magistrate judge in Salt Lake City agreed with the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that the case should remain in DC. The guards, who had turned themselves over to federal authorities in Utah Monday, were ordered to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jtLfZVVNZF72Pzftxt21yza9lVwAD94V5D000">report to a DC court</a> [AP report] on January 6. <br /><br />The five guards were <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/grandjury.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-indicts-five-blackwater-guards.php">report</a>] last Thursday on charges of voluntary manslaughter, attempt to commit manslaughter, and using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, which carries a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence. The indictments were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-unseals-indictments-for-five.php">unsealed</a> Monday [JURIST report]. On Friday, a sixth guard <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/us-v-ridgeway.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [text, PDF] to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident. The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. In November, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report]. Last month Bush administration officials announced that Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">security contractors would be losing immunity</a> from Iraqi law under the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">recently approved</a> [JURIST reports] US Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistani officials said Tuesday that <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/FM_Profile.htm">Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi</a> [official profile] will not hand over to India any Pakistani citizens arrested in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder], insisting instead on a joint investigation with Indian officials. Several offices of the Pakistani terrorist group <a href="http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/lashkaretaiba.asp">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [ADL backgrounder] have been raided as Pakistan <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD94V5EBG1">intensifies its efforts</a> [AP report] to apprehend terror suspects. On Sunday night, head of LeT <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/data/tops/terrorist_organization_member.asp?id=131">Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi</a> [START profile] and others believed to be responsible for the attacks last month were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-conspirators-of-mumbai-attacks.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan. India has also provided Pakistani authorities with a list of other suspects whom they want extradited to India. In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/09/opinion/09zardari.html?_r=1&ref=opinion">opinion piece</a> [text] published Tuesday in the <em>New York Times</em>, Pakistani <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/default.aspx">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official profile] wrote: <blockquote>Pakistan is committed to the pursuit, arrest, trial and punishment of anyone involved in these heinous attacks. But we caution against hasty judgments and inflammatory statements. As was demonstrated in Sunday&#8217;s raids, which resulted in the arrest of militants, Pakistan will take action against the non-state actors found within our territory, treating them as criminals, terrorists and murderers. Not only are the terrorists not linked to the government of Pakistan in any way, we are their targets and we continue to be their victims.</blockquote>While the recent raids have been acknowledged by India as a sign of Pakistan&#39;s commitment to cooperate, Indian officials have not yet responded to Qureshi&#39;s proposition for a joint investigation.<br /><br />The attacks in Mumbai which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website]. In a <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/lspeech.asp?id=760">statement</a> [press release] to the nation a day after the attacks started, Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/meet.htm">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] said the country &quot;will take the strongest possible measures to ensure that there is no repetition of such terrorist acts... [and will] take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.&quot; In the wake of the attacks, Singh <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">pushed for tougher anti-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report]. The attack was the worst the city has seen since a group of bombings killed more than 250 people in 1993.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Hebei Supreme Court in China on Monday rejected a class action suit filed against government-owned dairy farm Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co. by the families of children who died or were harmed as a result of tainted milk. Lawyers for the families <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hEkwG0nXjJ-CSlKegVX9Nls4OHlwD94UI2JG0">said</a> [AP report] that the while the prosecutor&#39;s office accepted their papers, it refused to accept the suit because the government was still investigating. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 63 plaintiffs, lays out a compensation package of about $991,000 for medical fees, food and transportation for the families involved, and about $1 million for psychological damage. Lawyers plan to continue pursuing the case.<br /><br />In October, the lawyers representing the families said that they had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-lawyers-allege-political-pressure.php">pressured by Chinese officials</a> [JURIST report] to stop providing legal support and to leave the issue to government authorities. Last month, lawyers said they would <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/china-lawyers-proceeding-with-class.php">proceed with the class action suit</a> [JURIST report]. News of possible milk powder contamination by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [Guardian report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders. The Health Ministry has attributed the contamination to the deaths of six children, and at least 294,000 other children were affected. So far, police have <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_294092.html">arrested at least 36</a> people [AFP report] in connection with the scandal.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-08-08.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/dec08.shtml#105Orig">briefs</a>] Monday in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1209.pdf">Peake v. Sanders</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court considered whether the <a href="http://www.va.gov/">US Department of Veterans Affairs</a> (VA) [official website] bears the burden of proof that it adequately informed a veteran of the information needed to process a benefits claim under the <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/laws/106/publ475.106.pdf">Veterans Claims Assistance Act</a> (VCAA) [text, PDF]. The case involves two veterans whose benefits claims were denied. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/06-7001.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the burden was on the VA to prove that notice was not prejudicial. Counsel for petitioner the VA argued that &quot;the uniform practice in the courts of appeals [at the time the VCAA was enacted] was to place upon challengers to agency action the burden of showing prejudice from the error. And the Congress was well aware of that.&quot; Counsel for one of the respondents, Patricia Simmons, argued that &quot;it would be difficult for the veteran and comparatively easy for the government to carry a burden.&quot;<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-512.pdf">Pacific Bell v. Linkline Communications</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether a company can be sued for anti-competitive practices if it sets its wholesale prices to block competitors from the retail market. <a href="http://www.linkline.com/">Linkline</a> [corporate website] filed an antitrust complaint against Pacific Bell, doing business as <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a> [corporate website] for cornering the DSL market and then charging high wholesale and low retail prices to make it impossible for smaller companies who buy DSL from AT&amp;T wholesale to compete in the retail market. AT&amp;T was required to sell its services to competitors under the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Reports/tcom1996.txt">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> [text]. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/01869D985FA0790588257353005142B7/$file/0556023.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Linkline&#39;s case survived a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Counsel for petitioner Pacific Bell argued that the decision does not comport with the Supreme Court&#39;s 2004 decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/02-682P.ZO">Verizon v. Trinko</a> [opinion, PDF], which held that there can be no claim unless the wholesaler has an antitrust duty to sell its product to its retail competitors. Respondents since agreed that the Ninth Circuit&#39;s decision was incorrect, but did not &quot;give up.&quot; Counsel for respondent argued that although he did not believe the decision of the Ninth Circuit was incorrect, per se, it was incomplete and should be vacated and remanded. Counsel for petitioner argued that &quot;a decision on the merits here is important because the Ninth Circuit&#39;s decision is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts and sufficient particle integration.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) on Sunday announced plans to collect signatures to initiate a referendum to make the province of Basra autonomous so that it can benefit from its oil wealth. The referendum was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hXwOX6WzhXa0GKvq6gpEuJTgxcRA">initiated by Wael Abdul Latif</a> [AFP report], an independent member of parliament and former magistrate. <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hfCCyTV6HjHhMen8-WdV-vnIsJkA">Signatures will be collected</a> [AFP report] from December 15 to January 14. The referendum could be held within three months. If passed, Basra would become an autonomous region with the same rights as Kurdistan, an autonomous region in northern Iraq. Abdul Latif maintains that relations with the central government would differ from Kurdistan&#39;s relations in that oil contracts would not become the responsibility of the Basra government.<br /><br />Basra is an oil-rich province in southern Iraq that produces about 70 percent of the country&#39;s oil. Control of the province was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48433">handed over to the Iraqi government</a> [DOD press release] last December. The semi-autonomous <A HREF="http://www.krg.org/">Kurdistan Regional Government</A> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/iraqi-kurd-government-adopts-regional.php">adopted the &quot;Kurdistan Oil and Gas Law&quot;</a> [JURIST report] in August 2007 after legislation was signed to allow the Kurdish government to control its own oil resources and select its own foreign investors.

The report, titled &quot;So Much to Fear: War Crimes and the Devastation of Somalia,&quot; accuses all parties to the conflict of committing war crimes, including the <a href="http://www.somali-gov.info/">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) [official website; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12475/">backgrounder</a>], insurgent groups, and intervening Ethiopian forces. Alleged violations include indiscriminate attacks, killings, rape, use of civilians as human shields, and looting. Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/08/somalia-war-crimes-devastate-population">said</a> [press release], &quot;The combatants in Somalia have inflicted more harm on civilians than on each other.&quot; HRW called on the US and the European Union to change their policies and help end the violence:<blockquote>Now is the time for fresh thinking and new political will on Somalia. Human Rights Watch calls upon all of the parties to the conflict in Somalia to end the patterns of war crimes and human rights abuses that have harmed countless Somalis and to ensure accountability for past abuses. This can only come to pass with much stronger and more principled engagement by key governments that have hitherto turned a blind eye to the extent and nature of conflict-related abuses in Somalia.</blockquote>Somalia has endured a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6159735.stm">lengthy civil war and several rounds of failed peace talks</a> [BBC timeline] since the collapse of its last civil government in 1991. In January 2007, the transitional government <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/somalia-imposes-martial-law-in-some.php">began imposing martial law</a> [JURIST report] over areas under the government&#39;s control. In August 2007, HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/war-crimes-rampant-in-somalia-hrw.php">war crimes were rampant</a> [JURIST report] in Somalia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/index.html">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Monday unsealed <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/grandjury.pdf">indictments</a> [text, PDF; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/December/08-nsd-1068.html">press release</a>] for five <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">Blackwater USA</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">news archive</a>] guards involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">September 2007 killings of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report]. The 35-count indictment, which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/doj-indicts-five-blackwater-guards.php">returned under seal</a> [JURIST report] last Thursday, charges each defendant with 14 counts of voluntary manslaughter, 20 counts of attempt to commit manslaughter, and one count of using and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. This marks the first time that State Department contractors will be prosecuted under the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/18C212.txt">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> (MEJA) [text], which allows criminal charges to be filed against contractors working for the Department of Defense. The defendants surrendered to federal authorities in Utah Monday morning. At a press conference, Assistant Attorney General Pat Rowan <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/December/08-nsd-1070.html">said</a> [prepared remarks]:<blockquote>Today&#8217;s indictment and guilty plea should serve as a reminder that those who engage in unprovoked and illegal attacks on civilians &#8211; whether during times of conflict or times of peace &#8211; will be held accountable.</blockquote>Also Monday a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/us-v-ridgeway.pdf">guilty plea</a> [text, PDF] was unsealed for a sixth Blackwater security guard. Jeremy Ridgeway pleaded guilty Friday to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter for his role in the same incident.<br /><br />The Blackwater incident caused domestic outrage in Iraq and has prompted legal controversy in the US. In November, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the incident concluded that the shootings were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/fbi-investigators-say-blackwater-iraqi.php">unjustified</a> [JURIST report]. Last month Bush administration officials announced that Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">security contractors would be losing immunity</a> from Iraqi law under the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">recently approved</a> [JURIST reports] US Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.hk/en/crt_services/pphlt/html/hc.htm">Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong</a> [Judiciary website] ruled on Monday that inmates have a constitutional right to vote while serving sentences. The court&#39;s decision stipulates that the justice department and the electoral commission must find a way to implement it within 14 days. A spokesman from the <a href="http://www.cmab.gov.hk/en/about/welcome.htm">Constitutional Affairs and Mainlaind Bureau</a> [official website] said that the government will <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=10677">study</a> [The <span style="font-style:italic;">Standard</span> report] the judgment and consider how to proceed. The court ruling would enable inmates to vote in territory elections for the first time in Hong Kong&#39;s history.<br /><br />Inmates should have the right to vote according to Article 21 of the <a href="http://un.org/Overview/rights.html">UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text] that states that the people&#39;s will should be expressed in &quot;periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage.&quot; The European <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] protects the right to free elections, and only nine states, including the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/uk-government-explores-granting-vote.php">UK</a> [JURIST report], do not allow inmates the right to vote. In the US, federal law allows states to determine their <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/states-loosen-felon-voting.php">own voting rules</a> [JURIST report], resulting in a full range of restrictions and freedoms to inmate&#39;s right to vote across the states.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iranian court has sentenced 16 former employees of the <a href="http://www.cbi.ir/default_en.aspx">Central Bank of Iran</a> [official website] to jail and lashes for accepting bribes. According to an <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Iran_To_Jail_Lash_ExCentral_Bank_Staff_For_Bribes/1357083.html">Iranian state radio broadcast</a> [Reuters report], the staff members were convicted of accepting cash, foreign currency, and gold in exchange for bank credit. The harsh sentences, including a reported 10 years of jail time, are seen as part of increasing efforts by the <a href="http://www.judiciary.ir/">Iranian judiciary</a> [official website, in Persian] to control official corruption in Iran.<br /><br />In January, an Iranian airport customs contractor convicted of corruption was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dnp.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] for his crimes. Three other airport customs contractors face the death penalty for similar crimes. <a href="http://www.president.ir/eng/ahmadinejad/bio/">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [official profile; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4107270.stm">profile</a>] has taken a tough stance again corruption and bribery, but, prior to January, no corruption offenders had been executed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/691/000134289/">Leyla Zana</a> [NNDB profile], a Kurdish spokesperson and member of the <a href="http://www.eutcc.org/">European Union Turkey Civic Commission</a> (EUTCC) [official website], was <a href="http://www.eutcc.org/articles/7/document368.ehtml">sentenced</a> [EUTCC press release] Saturday to 10 years in prison for supporting the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7044760.stm">Kurdistan Worker&#39;s Party</a> (PKK) [BBC profile; FAS <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/pkk.htm">backgrounder</a>]. A Turkish court in the city of Diyarbakir ruled that Zana had violated article 314 of the <a href="http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5237.html">Turkish Penal Code</a> [text, in Turkish] and anti-terror laws in nine speeches she gave between July 2007 and March 2008 in support of the PKK. The court also <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=160697&bolum=100">revoked</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Zaman</span> report] her right to vote and run for political office, among other political rights. In response to the sentence, Zana said in a statement to EUTCC Chair Kariane Westrheim:<blockquote>The case against me is a violation against freedom of thought, and represents a threat to every Kurd in Turkey. The decision of the court is just another way to repress, silence and punish the Kurds. The mentality governing this country is that problems can be resolved by anti democratic and repressive means and that unfair trial can provide political and social peace. But despite all this, our people will claim their legitimate rights, and will continue to struggle for this as long as it takes.</blockquote>Zana is expected to appeal the conviction to Turkey&#39;s Supreme Court of Appeals. <br /><br />Zana became notorious when she was the first women elected to Turkey&#39;s parliament in 1991, and shortly thereafter there were calls for her arrest when she read the Parliamentary Oath in Kurdish. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison along with other members of her Democracy Party, when the party was banned in 1994. She served ten years in prison until her conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/turkish-appeals-court-overturns.htm">overturned</a> and she was <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/kurdish-lawmakers-freed-by-turkish.htm">freed from prison</a> [JURIST reports] in 2004. In calling for a peaceful settlement to issues of Kurdish rights, she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 and 1998, and was awarded the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sakharov/default_en.htm">Sakharov Prize</a> [official website] in 1995.

Eight of 11 judges voted in favor of evicting a group of non-indigenous farmers from an Amazonian reservation, but the case was postponed when one judge requested more time to deliberate. A final ruling is not expected until next year. Indigenous people are already <a href="http://www.estadao.com.br/nacional/not_nac291856,0.htm">celebrating a victory</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Estadao</span> report, in Portuguese] with eight votes in their favor.<br /><br />The dispute is over a large area of land in northern Brazil known as Raposa Serra do Sol. Home to 20,000 indigenous people, it was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/4450755.stm">identified as a reservation</a> [BBC report] in 2005. The indigenous people want the approximately 200 non-indigenous rice producers who live and work on the land to be removed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN and Cambodian government officials said Wednesday in a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29252&Cr=cambodia&Cr1=court">statement</a> [UN News Center report] issued after a series of high-level meetings that they needed to address ongoing problems facing the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/default.aspx">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> [official website] in its efforts to try former Khmer Rouge officials suspected of crimes against humanity by &quot;enhancing its human resources management, including anti-corruption measures.&quot; The statement, however, provided few details and a UN Secretariat delegation led by Assistant-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs Peter Taksoe-Jensen <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/JL12Ae01.html">cancelled a scheduled press conference</a> [<em>Asia Times</em> report] before leaving Phnom Penh.<br /><br />In September a New Zealand judge serving on the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/cambodia-genocide-court-judge-warns.php">warned colleagues and prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] at a meeting of court officials that its upcoming genocide trials &quot;are so important for the people of Cambodia [that they] must not be tainted by corruption.&quot; The court has thusfar received little funding from international donors partly due to <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/component/option,com_myblog/Itemid,149/show,Court-rocked-by-new-corruption-allegations.html/">allegations of kickbacks for positions and other irregularities</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> report]. Outgoing US <a href="http://cambodia.usembassy.gov/ambassador.html">Ambassador Joseph Mussomeli</a> [official profile] said in September that the US will begin providing direct financial aid to the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-to-provide-funding-for-cambodia.php">once the tribunal takes adequate measures against corruption</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />The ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">plans to try as many as eight suspects</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the Khmer Rouge regime, which is generally held responsible for the <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">genocide of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] between 1975 and 1979. In June, court officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-aims-to.php">announced plans</a> [JURIST report] to complete operations a year early because of limited funding but said they would still be able to prosecute all the suspects.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/sc9527.doc.htm">added</a> [press release] the name of a Pakistani charity seen as a front for the group being blamed for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder] to its list of entities subject to asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo as a terrorist organization. At the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/india-urges-un-to-ban-alleged-terrorist.php">urging of the Indian government</a> [JURIST report], Jamaat-ud-Dawa was added as a pseudonym for the Pakistani terrorist group <a href="http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/lashkaretaiba.asp">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [ADL backgrounder] that India blames for the attacks. The UN also added the names of four individuals, including LeT leader <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/data/tops/terrorist_organization_member.asp?id=131">Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi</a> [START profile], who was arrested in a raid of a militant camp Sunday night. A spokesperson for the US State Department <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/dec/113087.htm">said</a> [press release] the US was &quot;pleased that the Committee has decided to move forward on these high-priority designations. These actions will limit the ability of known terrorists to travel, acquire weapons, plan, carry out, or raise funds for new terrorist attacks.&quot; One of Jamaat-ud-Dawa&#39;s leaders who was also added to the list, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD950KJ9O2">said that the group will petition</a> [AP report] the UN to overturn Wednesday&#39;s decision.<br /><br />The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city, including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website]. In the wake of the attacks, Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/meet.htm">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">pushed for tougher anti-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report].

So far Pakistan has arrested more than 20 people believed to be responsible for the attacks.

		<title>Whole Foods seeks injunction against FTC on merger trial</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods Market</a> [corporate website] filed an <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/whole-foods-complaint.pdf">action</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Monday requesting an injunction barring the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] from holding an administrative trial regarding the company&#39;s merger with <a href="http://www.wildoats.com/app/cda/oat_cda.php">Wild Oats Market</a> [corporate website]. The action also requests that any further proceedings be moved to federal court. The suit alleges that the FTC has a prejudgement on the case and that the company&#39;s due process rights are violated by the timing of the trial. The complaint regarding the prejudgement stems from the FTC publicly questioning the merger, including whether it violated anti-trust laws. John Mackey, co-founder and CEO of Whole Foods Market, <a href="http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/pr/wf/national/12-8-08ftcchallenge.aspx">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>How can the same FTC sit as judge and jury at sometime in the future of the very same case in which it has already declared that the Whole Foods-Wild Oats merger is illegal and it&#39;s key expert witness is &#39;garbage&#39;? The answer is - it shouldn&#39;t be allowed to. It has obviously already closed its mind. That&#39;s not our understanding of what due process and the principles of fundamental fairness are all about.</blockquote>In addition, Whole Foods alleges the timing of the FTC trial violates their due process rights. The FTC is questioning the merger&#39;s impact in 29 different geographic jurisdictions. Whole Foods argues that five months is not adequate time to prepare for what it considers to be essentially 29 different trials.<br /><br />In 2007, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-whole.php">refused to block</a> [JURIST report] the merger between Whole Foods and Wild Oats despite an appeal by the FTC. The court reviewed the case in August 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-orders.php">ordered the federal district court to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] the potential impacts of the merger on the market. The district court has not yet ruled on the matter.

		<title>US sees drop in executions, death sentences in 2008: report</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Executions in the US are at a 14-year low and the number of death sentences has dropped 60 percent since the 1990s, according to a <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/2008YearEnd.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; DPIC <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/2008YrEndPressRelease.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] released Thursday by the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> (DPIC) [advocacy website], a non-profit organization that opposes the death penalty. There were 37 executions in 2008 with no more expected this year, down from 42 in 2007 and 98 in 1999. Ninety-five percent of those executions took place in the South, with Texas executing 18 inmates. Only 111 inmates were sentenced to death in 2008, down from 115 in 2007 and 284 in 1999. Public support of the death penalty has also dropped to 64 percent, down from 69 percent in 2007 and 71 percent in 1999. The report also pointed to problems illustrated by stays of executions and exonerations as well as the high costs associated with keeping inmates on death row.<br /><br />Executions resumed in the US in April after the US Supreme Court lifted an <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">effective moratorium</a> by <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">upholding lethal injection</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/georgia-conducts-first-execution-since.php">first execution following the ruling</a> [JURIST report] was conducted in Georgia in May. New Jersey <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">abolished the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] last year. Last December, the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/un-general-assembly-passes-death.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a non-binding worldwide death penalty moratorium, calling for a suspension, rather than a complete abolition, of capital punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ireland has agreed to hold a second referendum on the European Union reform pact known as the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [official text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=treaty+lisbon">news archive</a>], according to draft materials circulated by the French government ahead of a <a href="http://www.ue2008.fr/PFUE/lang/en/accueil/PFUE-12_2008/PFUE-11.12.2008/Conseil_europeen_1112">meeting of EU government leaders</a> [press release] in Brussels Thursday. France holds the <a href="http://www.ue2008.fr">European Union Presidency</a> [official website] through the end of December. A draft summit text quoted by AFP says that &quot;The Irish government is committed to seeking ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of the term of the current commission.&quot; The document indicates that in return for a revote Ireland <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081211/wl_afp/eusummitirelandtreaty_081211104403">would be guaranteed a European Commissioner</a> [AFP report] under a revised arrangement of a plan that originally envisaged only two-thirds of EU countries having a Commissioner at any one time. <br /><br />An <font style="font-style: italic;">Irish Times</font> <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1117/1226700659487.html">poll</a> [report] published in November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/done-recent-poll-reveals-ireland-voters.php">suggested</a> [JURIST report] that 52.5 percent of Irish voters would approve the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [text; EU <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/index_en.htm">backgrounder</a>] if it were modified so that Ireland kept a European Union Commissioner and clarified Irish concerns over neutrality, abortion, and taxation. In June, 53.4 percent of Irish voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected the Lisbon Treaty</a> [JURIST report] in a referendum. In 2003 Ireland famously conducted a revote on the <a href="http://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/Treaties/Treaty_Nice_Rat.htm">Nice Treaty</a> [backgrounder] on the institutional arrangements for EU enlargement after initially rejecting it in 2002. Ireland has been the only nation to hold a referendum to approve the Lisbon Treaty. All 27 EU states must ratify the pact for it to become binding. In November, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/sweden-parliament-approves-treaty-of.php">Sweden became the 24th EU member to ratify the treaty</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian government has released six terror suspects, including <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/yazid_sufaat.htm">Yazid Sufaat</a> [GlobalSecurity profile] who allegedly gave assistance to the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attackers</a> [JURIST news archive], according to a Wednesday statement from Malaysian Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar. Yazid, released last month, was a member of the Southeast Asian terror group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>] who was arrested in 2001 on suspicion of working on a biological and chemical weapons program for al Qaeda. Five other suspects, including another JI member, two Malaysians, and two Thai nationals, were released last week. Syed Hamid told reporters that the suspects, who have been held without trial since 2001 or 2002, <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=377475">were released</a> [Bernama report] because it was determined that they no longer pose a threat. Syed Hamid also said that the cases would be <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/13991-man-linked-with-911-attacks-no-longer-threat-says-syed-hamid">reviewed periodically</a> [The <em>Malaysian Insider</em> report].<br /><br />The release of these suspects comes on the heels of last month&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/indonesia-ag-confirms-execution-of-3.php">execution of three other JI members</a> [JURIST report], convicted of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder] which killed 202 people. The three men had called on Islamic militant groups to carry out retribution attacks, which resulted in stepped-up security in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and a <a href="http://jakarta.usembassy.gov/consular/WMNov0908.htm">warning</a> [text] issued by the US embassy in Indonesia. In April, an Indonesian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/indonesia-judge-sentences-jemaah.php">convicted two JI leaders</a> [JURIST report] on terrorism charges and recognized JI as a terrorist organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Tuesday marks the 60th anniversary of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) [text], and is celebrated as <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/2008/">International Human Rights Day</a> [official website]. The occasion will be commemorated with a number of <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/udhr60/pdf/10%20December%202008_Agenda.pdf">special events</a> [schedule, PDF] at the UN headquarters in New York City, including the presentation of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/UNHRPrize2008.aspx">UN Prize in the Field of Human Rights</a> [official website] and a special meeting of the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website]. The theme for the 2008 International Human Rights Day is &quot;Dignity and justice for all of us.&quot; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/2008/statementssg.shtml">said</a> [statement text]:<blockquote>On this Human Rights Day, it is my hope that we will all act on our collective responsibility to uphold the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration. We can only honour the towering vision of that inspiring document when its principles are fully applied everywhere, for everyone.</blockquote>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navenethem Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/2008/statementshchr.shtml">said</a> [statement text]:<blockquote>We must work for the full implementation of human rights on the ground in a way that affects and improves the lives of the men, women and children who are all entitled, regardless of their race, sex, religion, nationality, property or birth, to realization of each and every right set forth in the Universal Declaration.</blockquote><br />The UN General Assembly adopted the UDHR in 1948 after World War II. It was drafted by representatives of all regions and legal traditions, and it represents core values of non-discrimination, equality, fairness, and universality that apply to everyone. The <a href="http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/2007/">2007 International Human Rights Day</a> [official website] marked the beginning of a year-long commemoration of these values, leading up to the 60th anniversary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Illinois Attorney General <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Lisa Madigan</a> [official website] <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0812/11/ltm.02.html">told CNN</a> [transcript text] Thursday that she would go before the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] to have <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] declared unfit to hold office if he did not resign or get impeached by the state legislature. Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday by agents from the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] on <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01a.pdf">charges of corruption</a> [complaint, PDF]. Madigan told CNN:<blockquote>I am prepared to take action, but obviously, the easiest way for us to move on in the state of Illinois is for Governor Blagojevich to do the right thing for the people and resign. Now, it doesn&#39;t appear that he has any inclination to do that. Maybe things will change today or tomorrow. But [if] he fails to, then the two other options are obviously the legislator [sic] moving forward on impeachment, or I have the opportunity to actually go to our Illinois supreme court and ask them to declare, basically, that our governor is unable to serve, and to put in our lieutenant governor as the acting governor.</blockquote>Madigan issued a <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/20081209.html">statement</a> [press release] Tuesday calling for Blagojevich&#39;s resignation. President-elect Barack Obama has also called for Blagojevich&#39;s resignation.<br /><br />Both Blagojevich and Harris have been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the Senate seat left vacant by Obama and obtaining illegal campaign contributions. They are also <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/source-feds-take-gov-blagojevich-into-custody.html">accused</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] of threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Both men were taken into federal custody early Tuesday morning and were released later in the day after appearing before a federal magistrate. Blagojevich reported to work on Wednesday and Thursday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vice President of the European Commission Responsible for Justice, Freedom, and Security <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/welcome/default_en.htm">Jacques Barrot</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/1922&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">reported</a> [press release] that <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] governments are violating people&#39;s right to travel freely among the EU member states. <a href="http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33152.htm">Directive 2004/38/EC</a> [materials] gives nationals of EU member states the right to move and reside freely among any of the states. According to the report, no member states have fully implemented the directive. The two biggest problems are the right of entry and residence of third country family members and the requirement of submitting additional documents for residence not foreseen in the directive. Barrot said:<blockquote>Free movement of persons constitutes one of the fundamental freedoms of the internal market, to the benefit of EU citizens, of the Member States and of the competitiveness of European economy. Flaws in the implementation of EU law in this field might result in a breach of the principles laying at the very core basis of the European construction. This is why the Commission will step up its efforts to ensure that EU citizens and their families effectively and fully enjoy their rights under the Directive. The Commission will use fully its powers under the Treaty to achieve this result, launching infringement proceedings when necessary, providing guidance to the Member States and ensuring that EU citizens are informed of their rights.</blockquote>Barrot added that the responsibility lies ultimately with the member states.<br /><br />The free movement of people among EU member states is described as a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/printer/fsj_freetravel_intro_en.htm">fundamental right</a> [EU materials], but not all members are satisfied with the current rules. Ireland has <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2008/1211/1228864661604.html">requested to amend</a> [<em>Irish Times</I> report] the part of the directive giving non-EU spouses the right to live in Ireland, but this was rejected Thursday. Other states including Denmark and Italy have also taken issue with the directive.

Amado said that Portugal would be willing to take in detainees, and that other EU member states that support the closure of the prison should do the same. He wrote:<blockquote>The time has come for the European Union to step forward. As a matter of principle and coherence, we should send a clear signal of our willingness to help the US Government in that regard, namely through the resettlement of detainees. As far as the Portuguese Government is concerned, we will be available to participate.</blockquote>Amado sent the letter Wednesday to coincide with the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/2008-international-human-rights-day.php">60th anniversary of the signing</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm">Universal Declaration on Human Rights</a> (UDHR) [text].<br /><br />Rights groups have urged US President-elect Barack Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Also in November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called upon Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">denounce Bush administration counterterrorism policies</a> [JURIST report] that they described as &quot;abusive.&quot; Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Guantanamo military commission trial of Afghan detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jawad">Mohammed Jawad</a> [JURIST news archive] that had been scheduled to start in early January was delayed indefinitely Wednesday by order of a military judge. US Army Col. Stephen Henley <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed2/idUSTRE4B96ZQ20081211">postponed the proceeding</a> [Reuters report] to give prosecutors more time to appeal a ruling denying admissibility of evidence Henley had previously found to be <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-military-judge-disqualifies-pentagon.php">inadmissible</a> [JURIST report] because he concluded it had been secured under death threats by Afghan officials constituting torture.<br /><br />Jawad was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 when he was 16 or 17 years old and was later transferred into US custody and brought to Guantanamo. He was designated an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; in 2004. He was later <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Oct2007/Jawad%20Charge%20Sheet.pdf">charged</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/fourth-guantanamo-bay-detainee-faces.php">report</a>] with attempted murder and intentionally causing serious bodily injury for his role in a December 2002 grenade attack in Kabul which injured two US soldiers and an Afghan translator. In May, Jawad <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/guantanamo-detainee-files-motion-to.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] to have all charges against him dismissed, alleging that he has been tortured in US custody and subjected to the so-called &quot;frequent-flier program,&quot; in which certain inmates are moved between cells at two to four hour intervals in an attempt to cause physical stress through sleep deprivation. Jawad was the fourth Guantanamo detainee to be formally charged with war crimes under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s3930enr.txt.pdf">2006 Military Commissions Act</a> [text, PDF], was set to face a military commission on January 5, 2009. His trial would have been the last started under the Bush administration. President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to close Guantanamo but has as yet offered no timetable and no plan for dealing with prisoners or their outstanding cases.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spanish National Court Judge Ismael Moreno Wednesday asked the Spanish Foreign Ministry for a certified copy of a 2002 internal government <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/200811/30/espana/20081130elpepunac_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">memorandum</a> [PDF text, in Spanish] detailing a US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/spain-aided-us-rendition-flights-report.php">request to use Spanish resources</a> [JURIST report] in aiding CIA <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] flights. Moreno said that <a href="http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&sid=1528944">after reviewing the memo</a> [AP report] he will subpoena the memo&#39;s purported author, Foreign Ministry official Miguel Aguirre de Carcer. Charges could be filed against current or former government officials who knowingly allowed US planes carrying prisoners to make stopovers on Spanish soil.<br /><br />The memo in question, originally labeled &quot;very secret&quot; but published by Madrid&#39;s <em>El Pais</em> newspaper late last month, is especially controversial because the Spanish government had previously <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/spain-to-investigate-secret-cia.php">denied consent or knowledge of rendition flights</a> [JURIST report] routed through Spain since 2005. When the memo was authored, Spain was led by a conservative government that gave way to the socialist administration of Prime Minister Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero in 2004. In 2006, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/spain-says-cia-rendition-flights-may.php">told the European parliament</a> [JURIST report] that, despite assurances from the US to the contrary, rendition flights may have stopped on Spanish islands off of the country&#39;s south coast.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Angolan government should stop torture and unfair trials in the province of <a href="http://www.cabinda.org/anglais.htm" alt="FOREIGN_ONLY">Cabinda</a> [government in exile website], according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/05/angola-end-torture-and-unfair-trials-cabinda">statement</a> [press release] issued Wednesday. HRW alleges that at least 15 civilians and six military personnel have been arbitrarily detained in Cabinda since September 2007. There has been only one trial, which resulted in a conviction, and HRW found that the trial fell short of international fair trial standards. HRW also alleges that the detainees have been tortured and held under inhumane conditions. HRW Africa Director Georgette Gagnon said, &quot;The Angolan government should immediately stop all torture of detainees and permit international scrutiny of military detention facilities in Cabinda. . . . Those responsible for the mistreatment of detainees should be held accountable.&quot; HRW claims that 14 civilians are currently being held illegally.<br /><br />Angola has a history of human rights violations, particularly in the province of Cabinda, which has been fighting for independence since 1975. In 2006, a pro-independence group in Cabinda <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/international-brief-uganda-opposition.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it was filing a request with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for the prosecutor&#39;s office to conduct an investigation into alleged Angolan war crimes. In August, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/08/12/angola-doubts-over-free-and-fair-elections">expressed doubts</a> [HRW report] as to whether the September elections would be fair and free. After the elections, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/09/14/angola-irregularities-marred-historic-elections">identified problems</a> [HRW report] with the electoral system and called for changes before the 2009 presidential elections.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-1015.pdf">Ashcroft v. Iqbal</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether high-ranking US officials are protected by qualified immunity from suit for alleged religious and ethnic discrimination by their subordinates.  Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani national detained during a terror sweep after the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive], filed a lawsuit against <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ashcroft-bio.html">former US Attorney General John Ashcroft</a>, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/directors/directmain.htm">FBI Director Robert Mueller</a> [official profiles], and other officials, alleging that he was subjected to abuse during his detention in a Brooklyn jail because of his religion and ethnicity. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Appeals Court for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysnative/RDpcT3BpbnNcT1BOXDA1LTU3NjhfY3Zfb3BuLnBkZg==/05-5768_cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:8080/isysquery/irl6d1c/1/hilite">allowed the lawsuit to go forward</a> [opinion, PDF], but the Bush administration appealed the ruling, arguing that the officials were protected from suit for the acts of their subordinates. Counsel for petitioners argued that &quot;these allegedly discriminatory determinations, classifications, were made by FBI officials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and director of the FBI. Counsel for the respondents argued that petitioners not only knew about, but approved the policy.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/07-543.pdf">AT&amp;T Corp. v. Hulteen</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether maternity leave taken before the passage of the 1978 <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-preg.html">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a> [EEOC backgrounder] can be considered in calculating employee pensions. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/F37D428B8113024E8825733A004B6F53/$file/0416087.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that AT&amp;T violated the act by failing to award employees credit for time taken off work for maternity leave before 1978. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the claims are stale and that the employees had fair and adequate notice of the employer&#39;s actions. Counsel for respondents argued that this is discrimination within a seniority system that gives &quot;unequal credit for equal service.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Indian government on Tuesday <a href="http://meaindia.nic.in/pressrelease/2008/12/09pr01.htm">urged</a> [transcript text] the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to ban a Pakistani charity seen as a front for the group being blamed for the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Indian Minister of State for External Affairs <a href="http://mea.gov.in/onmouse/moslink1.htm">E. Ahamed</a> [official profile] asked the UN to proscribe Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which it believes is a front for the Pakistani terrorist group <a href="http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/lashkaretaiba.asp">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [ADL backgrounder]. Ahamed told the members of the Security Council:<blockquote>The Jamaat-ud-Dawa and other such organizations need to be proscribed internationally and effective sanctions imposed against them. Their country of origin needs to take urgent steps to stop their functioning. A message must also go out that perpetrators of terrorist acts must be brought to book and not given sanctuaries in some states.</blockquote>A Pakistani diplomat <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/world/10nations.html?ref=world">said</a> [NYT report] that Pakistan would not oppose sanctions against the organization, as a gesture of good will. In a related development, Pakistani officials on Wednesday <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD94VSV800">confirmed the arrest</a> [AP report] of Zarrar Shah, an alleged conspirator of the attacks.<br /><br />The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city, including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website]. In the wake of the attacks, Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/meet.htm">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">pushed for tougher anti-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report]. On Sunday night, Pakistani police <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-conspirators-of-mumbai-attacks.php">raided a militant camp and arrested</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/data/tops/terrorist_organization_member.asp?id=131">Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi</a> [START profile], head of LeT, along with several other individuals believed to be responsible for the attacks. Pakistani officials said Tuesday that <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/FM_Profile.htm">Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/pakistan-refuses-to-hand-over-mumbai.php">will not hand over to India</a> [JURIST report] any Pakistani citizens arrested in connection with the attacks, insisting instead on a joint investigation with Indian officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] heard oral arguments Tuesday in an en banc rehearing of <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/arar-v.-ashcroft">Arar v. Ashcroft</a> [CCR backgrounder]. Canadian citizen <a href="http://www.maherarar.ca/">Maher Arar</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=arar">news archive</a>] is seeking a declaratory judgment against US government officials for having deported him to <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=syria">Syria</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2002, where he was tortured <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1121-08.htm">despite Syrian assurances</a> [<em>Globe &amp; Mail</em> report] that he would not be. In August, the court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-to-reconsider-arar.php">granted the request for a rehearing</a>, after initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-arar.php">dismissing</a> [JURIST reports] Arar&#39;s suit in July. Counsel for Arar <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhygq0GLVqIeobn4FnQlnGRYOWGw">argued</a> [AFP report] that Arar was a victim of a high-level US conspiracy to subject him to torture. The government argued that the court should not decide the case, allowing Congress an opportunity to create legislation to deal with an unusual circumstance like Arar&#39;s. <br /><br />Arar was detained by the US in September 2002 after flying to New York from Tunisia on his way home to Canada. Arar has <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-argues-appeal-rendition-victim-maher-arar:-u.s.-officials-must-be-held-a">argued</a> [CCR press release] that he should be able to challenge the US government&#39;s policy of <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victim Protection Act</a> [text] and the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution. In October 2007, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/us-lawmakers-apologize-to-rendition.php">apologized</a> [JURIST report] to Arar during a joint hearing of the <a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">House Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [official website].  In January 2007, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/canada-pm-announces-settlement-with.php">apologized to Arar</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the Canadian government and announced a settlement of $10.5 million (CAD) compensation for pain and suffering in connection with its involvement in the deportation. Last Friday, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072926p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/third-circuit-blocks-deportation-of.php">report</a>] that an Egyptian Christian who could face torture in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/countries/egypt.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] could challenge his deportation from the US.

The five defendants indicated at a military commission pre-trial hearing on Monday that they <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-911-conspirators-ask-to-plead.php">wished to plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges relating to the 9/11 attacks. The judge, <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/04/02/10/judgesbios.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">Army Col. Stephen Henley</a> [DOD biography, PDF], initially accepted the requests from three of the suspects - Mohammed, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, and Walid bin Attash - but ruled that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/08/guantanamo.defendants/index.html#cnnSTCText">competency hearings were required</a> [CNN report] for Mustafa al-Hawsawi and Ramzi Bin al-Shibh. Mohammed, Ali, and Attash then withdrew their offers to plead guilty until the competency of al-Hawsawi and al-Shibh is determined.<br /><br />Henley was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/new-judge-assigned-to-khalid-sheikh.php">assigned to the Mohammed trial</a> last month, following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/chief-us-military-commissions-judge.php">retirement</a> [JURIST reports] of <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=kohlmann">Marine Col.

City of Valdez</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/08-310_pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Court will consider whether a municipal tax that falls exclusively on large vessels in the city&#8217;s harbor violates the Tonnage Clause (Art. 1 &sect; 10 cl. 3), Commerce Clause (Art. 1 &sect; 8 cl. 3), or the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">US Constitution</a> [text]. The city of Valdez, Alaska, imposes a tax on oil tankers and other large vessels using its port to pick up and deliver crude oil.

These cases arise from the bankruptcy of asbestos manufacturer <a href="http://www.jm.com/">Johns-Manville Corp.</a> [corporate website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/Supreme%20Court%20of%20Nigeria.htm">Supreme Court of Nigeria</a> [official website] on Friday upheld the results of the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-ruling-party-wins-poll-but-eu.php">disputed 2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST report] which was won by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6187249.stm">President Umaru Yar&#39;Adua</a> [BBC profile]. The court <a href="http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/breaking_news/article01">dismissed the appeal</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] brought by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Atiku+Abubakar+">former Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://www.buhari.org/">Muhammadu Buhari</a> [campaign website], Yar&#39;Adua&#39;s main challenger in the election, after it was alleged that the election was marred by <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">rampant fraud</a> [JURIST report]. The two men argued that there were violations of electoral laws that were capable of affecting the elections, particularly where the <a href="http://www.inecnigeria.org/">Independent National Electoral Commission</a> (INEC) [official website] had declared Yar&#39;Adua the winner before each state announced its results. Yar&#39;Adua rebutted that argument, saying the two had not proven that the election was not in compliance with electoral laws. Yar-Adua promised on Friday to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gh32rZ38-M7Fc3A7z_T3LVJHa7xQ">speed up election reforms</a> [AFP report] in the wake of the court&#39;s ruling.<br /><br />In April 2007, the INEC declared Yar&#39;Adua the winner of the country&#39;s presidential elections, prompting the filings by Buhari and Abubakar. The election tribunal, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/nigeria-creates-election-tribunal-ahead.php">formed</a> [JURIST report] prior to the election in order to handle disputes, ordered the INEC to <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/nigeria-election-tribunal-orders.php">turn over certified copies of the ballots</a> [JURIST report] and provide information on all officials and staff employed for the elections. In February Nigeria&#39;s Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal upheld the results of the election, saying that opposition groups failed to present sufficient evidence to support their <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">fraud allegations</a> [JURIST report]. Buhari and Abubakar appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. Yar&#39;Adua had said that he would resign if the Supreme Court invalidated his victory. In October, the court announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/nigeria-top-court-defers-ruling-on.php">reserve judgment on the appeal</a> [JURIST report] indefinitely.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.chd.lu/default.jsp">Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in French] on Thursday voted to <a href="http://www.chd.lu/docs/pdf/PR5967.pdf">amend</a> [text, PDF, in French] the country&#39;s constitution to eliminate the requirement that its Grand Duke approve legislation before it becomes law. The country&#39;s parliament <a href="http://www.chd.lu/docs/pdf/PR5967.pdf">passed the amendment</a> [<em>Tageblatt</em> report, in German] by a vote of 56-0, with one abstention. It reduces the Grand Duke&#39;s legislative role under article 34 of Luxembourg&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/textescoordonnes/recueils/constitution_droits_de_lhomme/CONST1.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF, in French] from both sanctioning and promulgating laws, to merely their promulgation. The amendment came after the country&#39;s current monarch, <a href="http://www.monarchie.lu/fr/index.html">Grand Duke Henri</a> [official website, in French], said he would not approve a bill passed by the parliament earlier this year that <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/luxembourg-parliament-passes-euthanasia.php">legalizes euthanasia</a> [JURIST report]. Supporters of the change say the amendment modernizes the country&#39;s constitution in line with other countries which reserve a purely ceremonial role for their monarchs. Henri has said he will approve the amendment. The second reading of the euthanasia bill, a step necessary for it to become law, will take place on December 18.<br /><br />The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1904789.stm">Netherlands</a> [BBC report] legalized euthanasia in 2001 and <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/belgium-euthanasia-cases-double-since.php">Belgium</a> [JURIST report] followed suit in 2002. In February 2007, the <a href="http://www.bger.ch/">Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland</a> [official website, in German] ruled that people with serious mental illnesses <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/swiss-court-extends-physician-assisted.php">may be permitted to commit physician-assisted suicide</a> [JURIST report] under certain conditions.  A proposed bill that would legalize assisted suicide in the United Kingdom was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside by the House of Lords</a> in May 2007 following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition by physician groups</a> [JURIST reports]. In January 2006, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld Oregon&#39;s Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report]; Oregon is the only US state that allows physician-assisted suicide. Euthanasia remains illegal in <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/italy-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/french-court-convicts-doctor-in.php">France</a> [JURIST reports] and Spain.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK financial firm <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/">Bramdean Alternatives Limited</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/news/send_attachment/48">raised concerns</a> [statement, DOC] Saturday about the US financial regulatory process in the wake of Thursday&#39;s arrest of former <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</a> [official website] chairman Bernard Madoff for a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">$50 billion fraud scheme</a> [JURIST report]. Bramdean&#39;s value <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7782731.stm">dropped by more than 35 percent</a> [BBC report] over news of its exposure to the fraud, which was disclosed by US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">charges</a> [complaint, PDF; SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-293.htm">press release</a>] filed on Thursday in New York against Madoff and his firm, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071019050645/http://www.madoff.com/">Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC</a> [archived website]. Bramdean&#39;s statement said, &quot;The alleged failure raises fundamental questions about the regulatory system under which this has happened and no doubt this will be the subject of intense debate as the facts emerge.&quot; Several foreign financial institutions have been affected by the scandal, including <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk/">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, <a href="http://www.mangroupplc.com/Default.aspx?PageID=122">Man Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite?accesibilidad=3&canal=CAccionistas&empr=SANCorporativo&pagename=SANCorporativo/GSDistribuidora/SC_Index">Santander</a> [corporate websites].<br /><br />Madoff has been charged with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts]. Madoff allegedly told two employees of his firm Wednesday that his investment advisory business was a fraud. According to the complaint, Madoff &quot;stated that he was &#39;finished,&#39; that he had &#39;absolutely nothing,&#39; that &#39;it&#39;s all just one big lie,&#39; and that it was &#39;basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.&#39;&quot; Madoff was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gA_cNr1uDE47pySwMmPvCpqCHH3gD951AIT00">released on bail</a> [AP report] Thursday, and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 12. Madoff, 70, founded his investment firm in 1960. He has served as chairman of the board of directors of the NASDAQ stock market and was a member of the board of governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). According to his firm&#39;s website, it ranked among the top 1 percent of US securities firms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Israeli <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] Sunday denied entry to and deported the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights on Palestinian territories  occupied since 1967, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/people/bios/index.xml?netid=rfalk">Richard Falk</a> [academic profile]. Falk was attempting to enter Israel in his official capacity for the first time since assuming his position in May. As special rapporteur, Falk is responsible for advocating for the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories, and providing the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] with reports and information regarding the human rights situation there. According to reports, Falk was denied entry to Israel because his visit <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/12/15/UN_envoy_expelled_from_Israel/UPI-18881229347443/">had not been coordinated with the Israeli government</a> [UPI report]. Several Palestinian rights organizations demanded that the Israeli Interior Minister and Attorney General <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1046838.html">lift the entry ban on Falk</a> [<em>Ha&#39;aretz</em> report], characterizing his office as an important safeguard for Palestinian human rights.<br /><br />The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in April that <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-bars-un-palestinian-rights-envoy.php">Falk would not be allowed to enter Israel</a> [JURIST report] because of accusations against him of bias and his past comments calling Israeli actions against Palestinians a &quot;Holocaust in the making.&quot; In October 2007, former Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/fac/dugard/">John Dugard</a> [academic profile] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/un-must-better-address-rights-situation.php">UN must better address human rights violations committed in the Palestinian territories</a> [JURIST report]. He has also previously criticized Israel&#39;s continued military presence in the region, <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/un-rights-expert-compares-occupation.php">comparing it to South African apartheid</a> [JURIST report]. Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an independent expert by the now-defunct UN Commission on Human Rights to investigate Israeli rights violations. Israel and the US have dismissed his reports as one-sided.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Illinois Governor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=george+ryan">George Ryan</a> [JURIST news archive] on Friday issued his first <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/georgeryantrial/1329077,george-ryan-apology-text-121208.article">public apology</a> [text] for the crimes that resulted in his imprisonment. Ryan&#39;s apology comes in the wake of last week&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] of current <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] on corruption charges. In a letter that will be added to his clemency petition filed recently with the White House, Ryan wrote:<blockquote>I want to make things right in my heart with God, with my family, and with those that I have hurt. As a former public official, a husband, a father, and a grandfather, I apologize. Even though I cannot undo my mistakes, I hope I can restore some faith in your hearts and minds by opening up and sharing these thoughts. And even though it took time for me to come to this place, in the end my goal is to do the right thing, no matter how tardy or flawed.</blockquote>Ryan has asked President George W. Bush to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-durbin-ryan-02-dec02,0,5132572.story">commute his sentence</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] to time served.<br /><br />Ryan was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-illinois-governor-sentenced-to.php">sentenced last year</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/former-illinois-governor-heads-to.php">jailed</a> [JURIST reports] on corruption charges. Ryan&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/ex-illinois-governor-heading-to-trial.php">trial</a> began in 2005, and in 2006 a jury found him <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/breaking-news-former-illinois-governor.php">guilty</a> [JURIST reports] on multiple counts of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2003/warner_ryan.pdf">corruption and fraud</a> [indictment, PDF] in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred during Ryan&#39;s term as Illinois Secretary of State. Ryan made national headlines and won praise in some quarters in January 2003 when, just before leaving office, he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/11/illinois.death.row/">commuted the executions</a> [CNN report; <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/news/ssection/deathpenalty/speech.html">speech transcript</a>] of all Illinois inmates then on death row.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) is inefficient and ineffective, with detainees waiting months or years for trials that do not meet international fair trial standards, according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iraq1208web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/14/iraq-unfair-trials-mar-main-criminal-court">press release</a>] released Sunday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The report, titled &quot;The Quality of Justice: Failings of Iraq&#39;s Central Criminal Court,&quot; alleges that the court relies heavily on testimony of secret informants and coerced confessions. It also describes cases where defendants have waited as long as two years for a hearing with lawyers having little or no access to their clients or case files. The report states:<blockquote>The CCCI is the country&#8217;s flagship criminal justice institution. Yet it is an institution that is seriously failing to meet international standards of due process and fair trials. Defendants often endure long periods of pretrial detention without judicial review, and are not able to pursue a meaningful defense or challenge evidence against them. Abuse in detention, typically with the aim of extracting confessions, appears common, thus tainting court proceedings in those cases.</blockquote>HRW makes recommendations to the Iraqi government, including limiting the use of secret informants and disallowing confessions obtained through torture. It also makes recommendations to the US government, including transferring detainee cases to the legal jurisdiction of the Iraqi courts, but retaining physical custody of the detainees to avoid the risk of torture.<br /><br />The CCCI will become increasingly more active as the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">recently approved</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] takes effect at the end of the year, transferring detainees held by the US-led Multinational Force to Iraqi jurisdiction. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/transfer-of-iraq-detainees-under.php">human rights groups expressed their concern</a> [JURIST report] about the treatment of detainees due to be transferred from US military custody to Iraqi authorities under the SOFA. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/default.asp">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</a> (UNAMI) [official website] reported that while general security conditions in Iraq have improved, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/human-rights-violations-continuing-in.php">human rights violations have continued</a> [JURIST].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/chertoff-bio.html">Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile] on Sunday <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7782240.stm">told</a> [transcript text] the BBC that before closing the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive], President-elect Barack Obama must have a plan for dealing with the detainees. In an appearance on <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em>, Chertoff said that there must be a system in place for determining whether detainees can be returned to their home countries, and a plan for what to do with those detainees that cannot be returned. Chertoff said:<blockquote>Well my advice [to Obama] would be to take a deep breath and try to put together a plan that would sort between the various categories of detainee. Some I think can be sent back and we&#39;ve been doing that. Some will not be able to be sent back and we need to have a legal process to resolve their cases in a way that is fair to them, but also takes account of the special problem of trying people where there is national security evidence.</blockquote>He also said that Obama&#39;s biggest challenge will be &quot;to build a sustainable process for going forward with respect to the War on Terror.&quot;<br /><br />Last week Portugal&#39;s foreign minister said that his country would be <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">willing to take in</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees if Obama closed the facility, and encouraged other European Union member states to do the same. Rights groups have urged Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Also in November, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called upon Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">denounce Bush administration counterterrorism policies</a> [JURIST report] that they described as &quot;abusive.&quot; Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on Saturday voted down a challenge to the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk//profile-hj(3).htm">Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar&#39;s</a> [official profile] appointment, as Pakistani Law Minister Farooq H. Naek defended Dogar as the lawful chief justice. The PBC unanimously adopted a measure denouncing as illegal the November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-high-court-battles-musharraf.php">declaration of emergency rule</a> [JURIST report] by then-Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf that led to the ousting of former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Despite the condemnation, the PBC <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2008/12/14/top8.htm">voted 6-12 against</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Dawn</span> report] a call to reinstate Chaudhry as chief justice. Also defeated was a resolution to take action against Dogar for allegations that he abused his position to secure his daughter&#39;s admission to medical school. Following the vote, National Assembly Standing Committee on Education Chairman Abid Sher Ali <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=18950">sent a letter</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">News</span> report] to President Asif Ali Zardari urging him to seek Dogar&#39;s resignation.<br /><br />The challenges to Dogar were introduced by recently-elected president of the Pakistan Supreme Court Bar Association Ali Ahmad Kurd, who has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/chaudhry-still-constitutional-chief.php">taken up the charge to reinstate Chaudhry</a> [JURIST report] as the &quot;constitutional&quot; chief justice of Pakistan. Last month, members of the Pakistan <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/magazine/01PAKISTAN-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin">lawyers&#39; movement</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=lawyers+movement">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/pakistan-lawyers-press-call-to.php">renewed their demands for the reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of all superior court judges dismissed by Musharraf&#39;s emergency rule. Although Pakistani officials have now reinstated most of the over 60 judges ousted by Musharraf, Naek has <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-law-minister-rules-out.php">repeatedly insisted that Chaudhry will not be reinstated</a> [JURIST report] because Dogar was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/musharraf-swears-in-new-pakistan-chief.php">legitimately appointed</a> [JURIST report] and the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">Pakistani Constitution</a> [text] does not permit the appointment of two chief justices.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Rape and sexual warfare have been employed by the national army of the <a href="/countries/congo.php">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [JURIST news archive] as well as by rebel groups, according to an <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] report <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLC744528.html">released</a> [Reuters report] Friday. The report, based on an AI <a href="http://livewire.amnesty.org/?p=279#more-279">research mission to North Kivu</a> [AI Livewire report], said that army units engaged in looting, killing, and rape without oversight or punishment, and victims were reportedly threatened if they attempted to seek medical attention. AI field operatives said that army commanders denied the abuses when confronted. AI Secretary-General Irene Khan called for <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE200812108611&lang=e">immediate</a> [AI press release] increased presence and protection from <a href="http://www.monuc.org/">UN Mission in DR Congo</a> (MUNOC) [official website] peacekeepers, particularly in refugee camps and along major roads. Khan also urged the DRC to prosecute human rights abusers, and for international bodies including the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] to hold the DRC government accountable for its troops&#39; actions. <br /><br />The report came the same day that the UN Security Council <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29299&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo">announced</a> [UN News Centre report; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2008/081212_DRC_Experts.doc.htm">press conference</a>] evidence gathered by a designated Group of Experts that Rwandan authorities and the Congolese army provided assistance to enemy rebel groups in the eastern DRC. The group&#39;s <a href="http://www.cndp-congo.org/index-en.php">report</a> [PDF] found that the Rwandan government informally aided the rebel <a href="http://www.cndp-congo.org/index-en.php">National Congress in Defence of the People</a> (CNDP) [group website] to recruit soldiers, supplied military equipment, and sent Rwandan military units to support the predominantly-Tutsi CNDP. The report also cited &quot;strong evidence&quot; that the DRC national army provided military support to the majority-Hutu rebel group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda</a>(FDLR) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in operations against the CNDP. <br /><br />Earlier this month, the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-rights-council-adopts-resolution.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] condemning human rights violations in the DRC, but was criticized for failing to reinstate an independent monitor and commence a fact-finding mission to investigate abuses. Last week, Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/11/killings-kiwanja-0">reported</a> [HRW materials] that from November 4-5, 150 civilians were summarily executed just outside a MUNOC base in the North Kivu province. That report noted that the DRC armed forces are openly hostile to MUNOC efforts, and called for &quot;bridging troop&quot; support from the European Union. Current European Union President Nicolas Sarkozy immediately <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/12/content_10497237.htm">rejected the prospect of EU military intervention</a> [Xinhua report] in the region. In 2006, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/congo-needs-to-prosecute-out-of.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that sexual abuse of women and girls by soldiers in DRC combat zones had &quot;become a cancer in Congolese society that seems to be out of control.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Russian <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] Friday approved by 355-85 a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-lower-house-advances-bill-to-end.php">bill that would end jury trials on charges of terrorism and treason</a> [JURIST report]. Ostensibly directed against <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/372915.htm">lenient juries</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], the bill is excepted to be quickly approved in the <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/eng/index.html">Federation Council</a> [official website], the upper house of the Russian parliament. The measure may have only limited effect given the relative rarity of jury trials in Russian criminal procedure already - in 2006 only about <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_RUSSIA_JURY_TRIALS?SITE=ILROR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">700 of more than 1.2 million criminal trials</a> [AP report] in Russia were tried by juries - but it has prompted criticism by opposition parties and rights groups and seems to cut against a recent <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/news_detale.php?id=5559">proposal</a> [transcript, in Russian] by Russian president <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] to make Russian courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">more transparent</a> [JURIST report]. <br /><br />The bill follows a general Russian trend towards increased government power. In July 2007, then-President Vladimir Putin approved <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">tough amendments to Russia&#39;s law against extremism</a> [JURIST report]. An international panel of jurists reported earlier that year that expanded Russian anti-terrorism laws were leading to <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-panel-says-russian-anti-terror.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report]. In 2006, Putin signed a <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/putin-signs-russia-anti-terror-bill.php">bill</a> [JURIST report] giving Russian police and military broad authority to tap telephone conversations and control electronic communications in the vicinity of counter-terror operations, shoot down hijacked planes threatening public places or strategic facilities, and deal with the aftermath of terrorist attacks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/AE391D648668C8138825751C0081A75B/$file/0635597.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 2-1 Friday that Seattle&#39;s parade law is unconstitutional. The court was asked to decide whether the <a href="http://clerk.ci.seattle.wa.us/~scripts/nph-brs.exe?d=CODE&s1=11.25.020.snum.&Sect5=CODE1&Sect6=HITOFF&l=20&p=1&u=/~public/code1.htm&r=1&f=G">Seattle Municipal Ordinance</a> [text] violates the free speech guarantees of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">First Amendment</a> [text] by granting a city licensing official unduly broad discretion. Judge Raymond Fisher wrote for the majority: <BLOCKQUOTE>The Parade Ordinance&#8217;s open-ended standard, combined with the absence of a requirement that officials articulate their reasons or an administrative-judicial review process, vests the Seattle Chief of Police with sweeping authority to determine whether or not a parade may utilize the forum of the streets to broadcast its message. The First Amendment prohibits placing such unfettered discretion in the hands of licensing officials and renders the Parade Ordinance constitutionally defective on its face.</BLOCKQUOTE>The case involved the Seattle affiliate of the <a href="http://www.october22.org/">October 22nd Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation</a> [advocacy website] (&#8220;Coalition&#8221;), an unincorporated association dedicated to raising awareness of the problem of police brutality. The Coalition had applied for and received a parade permit from the Seattle Chief of Police and claimed that over the past few years these permits were subjected to conditions that the Coalition found objectionable. The Coalition argued that the Ordinance violated the First Amendment because it failed to provide sufficient guidance to the police on when they might require marchers to use the sidewalks and deny them access to the streets, thus creating an unacceptable risk that officers would arbitrarily modify certain groups&#8217; permits by prohibiting them from marching in the streets based on the content of their speech.<br /><br />Parade laws in a number of US cities have been successfully challenged by activists in recent years. In 2006, New York City Criminal Court Judge Gerald Harris <a href="http://www.oliverandoliverlaw.com/ORAM.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the City&#8217;s parade permit law was &#8220;hopelessly overbroad&#8221; and &#8220;constitutes a burden on free expression that is more than the First Amendment can bear.&#8221; In 2003, a federal court judge <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/federal-judge-orders-pittsburgh-to.htm">ordered the city of Pittsburgh</a> [JURIST report] to revise its parade permit issuing ordinance after three civil rights organizations and the ACLU filed suit against the city alleging it discriminated against certain groups when issuing parade permits. In 2001, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/gen/11070prs20011010.html">Honolulu amended its parade permit system</a> [ACLU press release] to avoid a similar ACLU suit.

While being escorted to court, he overpowered a Fulton County Sheriff&#8217;s Deputy and took her gun. Nichols proceeded to search for and kill Judge Rowland Barnes, court reporter Julie Ann Brandau, Sheriff&#8217;s Deputy Sgt. Hoyt Teasley, and US Customs agent David Wilhelm. He was taken into custody after what was described as the largest manhunt in Georgia state history. He later <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/atlanta-courthouse-murder-suspect.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges against him. <br /><br />US judges and court administrators have been increasingly focused on <a href="http://www.ncsconline.org/wc/CourTopics/ResourceGuide.asp?topic=CtSecu">security issues</a> [NCSC materials] following a spate of <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/man-who-committed-suicide-in-wisconsin.php">attacks</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/suspected-pipe-bomb-explodes-outside.php">bombings</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/ny-man-arrested-for-threatening.php">threats</a> [JURIST reports] directed at judges, their families, and their workplaces in recent years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] French President Nicholas Sarkozy told reporters in Brussels Friday at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of European Union leaders that the <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/download/?mode=press&filename=12.12_Conf_Presse_Bruxelles.pdf">Lisbon Treaty on EU reform had been &quot;revived&quot;</a> [PDF transcript, in French] after <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-agrees-to-hold-second.php">Ireland agreed to hold a revote on ratification</a> [JURIST report]. An initial referendum on the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOHtml.do?uri=OJ:C:2007:306:SOM:EN:HTML">Treaty</a> [official text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=treaty+lisbon">news archive</a>] failed in Ireland in June. Sarkozy, whose country holds the rotating European Presidency through the end of December, added:<BLOCKQUOTE>To do this, we said unanimously that if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified by all Member States, each state would have a commissioner...<br /><br />Secondly, political commitments have been given to the Irish on neutrality, on taxation, and on the family. These are recurring themes and important for our Irish friends. And we have put forward a compromise which ensures that everyone will not be obliged to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon all over again. There will be no modification of the Treaty of Lisbon. But at the same time to give legal status to political commitments of the twenty-six member states towards the Irish, we committed to ensuring that when the next enlargement takes place in 2010 or 2011 when Croatia is likely to join us anyway, there will be a new treaty, a treaty of accession, ratified by the twenty-seven Member States, since Europe at that time becomes twenty-eight. We will add to the treaty of accession for Croatia an Irish protocol...</BLOCKQUOTE>A document signed by all EU leaders commits the Irish government to <a href="http://euobserver.com/15/27295">hold a new ratfication referendum by November 2009</a> [EUobserver report], the end of the term of the current European Commission. The deal is not without its critics, however - speaking in Prague Friday, Czech President Vaclav Klaus said the effective rewording of the Treaty meant that the current ratifications are no longer valid and the <a href="http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1229107621.39">pact had to be rewritten</a> [AFP report]. The Czech Republic succeeds France in the European Presidency on January 1.<br /><br />An <font style="font-style: italic;">Irish Times</font> <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1117/1226700659487.html">poll</a> [report] published in November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/done-recent-poll-reveals-ireland-voters.php">suggested</a> [JURIST report] that 52.5 percent of Irish voters would approve the Treaty if it were modified so that Ireland kept a European Union Commissioner and clarified Irish concerns over neutrality, abortion, and taxation. In 2003 Ireland famously conducted a revote on the <a href="http://www.unizar.es/euroconstitucion/Treaties/Treaty_Nice_Rat.htm">Nice Treaty</a> [backgrounder] on the institutional arrangements for EU enlargement after initially rejecting it in 2002. Ireland has been the only nation to hold a referendum to approve the Lisbon Treaty. All 27 EU states must ratify the pact for it to become binding. In November, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/sweden-parliament-approves-treaty-of.php">Sweden became the 24th EU member to ratify the treaty</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Colombian <a href="http://web.presidencia.gov.co/presidente/">President Alvaro Uribe</a> [official profile, in Spanish] has called for <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9272">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> (FARC) [CFR backgrounder] guerrillas to abandon arms and release political hostages, promising those who respond to the call a reward and freedom. Uribe Wednesday likened the offered terms to a <a href="http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/web/noticias/2008/diciembre/diciembre_10_08.htm">&quot;humanitarian exchange&quot;</a> [press release, in Spanish]. He specified that he was not promising amnesty or an official pardon, but he did promise that defecting guerrillas who free a hostage and who may have other serious charges against them will be entitled to a reward and freedom. This promise <a href="http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/politica/beneficios-por-liberar-a-secuestrados-tambien-serian-para-secretariado-de-las-farc_4718370-1">extends</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Tiempo</span> report, in Spanish] even to guerrilla leadership in an effort to weaken FARC forces, according to Peace Commissioner <a href="http://www.altocomisionadoparalapaz.gov.co/web/documentos/perfil1.htm">Luis Carlos Restrepo</a> [official profile, in Spanish]. Restrepo has the responsibility of devising a legal framework to enable the president&#39;s political decision. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] condemned Uribe&#39;s proposal, issuing a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGAMR230432008&lang=e">statement</a> [press release] that perpetrators of human rights abuses such as hostage-takers &quot;must be investigated and tried.&quot;<br /><br />Uribe issued his promise on the same day that the first guerrilla member to defect and receive both a monetary reward and acceptance in France <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/11/isaza-farc-french-asylum-sarkozy">left Colombia</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report]. France has pledged to give asylum to guerrillas who abandon arms under certain conditions that include clearance from the General Prosecutor of the Nation that they have no serious charges pending against them. The UN Commissioner for Human Rights in November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/colombia-rights-violations-systematic.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the hostage situation is a large component of the systematic and widespread human rights violations in Colombia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Illinois Attorney General <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Lisa Madigan</a> [official website] on Friday filed a <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/MOTION_FOR%20TRO_12-12-2008_10-19-24.pdf">motion</a> [motion, PDF; <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/brief.pdf">brief</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/SUPPORTING_RECORD_TRO_12-12-2008_10-20-37.pdf">supporting record</a>, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] to have <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] declared unfit and removed temporarily from office. Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday by federal agents on <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01a.pdf">charges of corruption</a> [complaint, PDF]. Madigan asked that the court appoint <a href="http://www.standingupforillinois.org/">Lieutenant Governor Patrick Quinn</a> [official website] as acting governor. She is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/chi-blagojevich-lisa-madigan-attorney-general,0,5919374.story">concerned</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] that, if allowed to remain in office, Blagojevich would still have the power to appoint someone to President-elect Barack Obama&#39;s vacant senate seat. Madigan argued in her motion:<blockquote>As the State&#39;s chief executive, Mr. Blagojevich has substantial power and authority to set policy, direct administrative agencies, issue executive orders, provide for disbursement of funds, borrow money on behalf of the State, award contracts, and appoint state officials. Because of the pendency of the federal complaint, the executive decisions that Mr. Blagojevich makes are tainted. Indeed, every day this State is faced with an allegedly corrupt Governor making critical decisions that have no legitimacy. Furthermore, Mr. Blagojevich&#39;s continued exercise of gubernatorial authority damages the public&#39;s faith and confidence in the Office and in the effectiveness of the state government.</blockquote>Quinn has joined calls for Blagojevich, who has continued to report to work since the arrest, to be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hVNAcA-xtCA6PKQ8h5s7dBlD_BKwD9517MKO2">impeached</a> [AP report]. Madigan issued a <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/20081209.html">statement</a> [press release] Tuesday calling for Blagojevich&#39;s resignation. Obama has also called for Blagojevich&#39;s resignation. Harris <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gQcHXIYZaU58UDPVEzCi2aqMShDQD951BG4G0">resigned</a> [AP report] Friday. <br /><br />Madigan told CNN Thursday that she was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-ag-set-to-ask-state-supreme.php">prepared to file a motion</a> [JURIST report] with the state Supreme Court. Both Blagojevich and Harris have been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the senate seat left vacant by Obama and obtaining illegal campaign contributions. They are also <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/12/source-feds-take-gov-blagojevich-into-custody.html">accused</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] of threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Both men were taken into federal custody early Tuesday morning and were released later in the day after appearing before a federal magistrate.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Taiwanese prosecutors on Friday indicted former President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chen+shui-bian">news archive</a>] on charges of corruption. His wife Wu Shu-chen, his son and daughter-in-law, three former presidential aides, and eight other associates and family members were also indicted. Chen has been charged with embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering. Prosecutors plan to seek the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gt9ye790IK7GxfUSra2N8dZCflOg">maximum punishment</a> [AFP report] allowed. Chen will <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=812056&lang=eng_news">continue to receive his retirement benefits</a> [<em>Taiwan News</em> report], despite his indictment. <br /><br />Chen has been detained since his November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-arrested-on.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of embezzling money from the state affairs fund. While in prison, Chen went on a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-on-hunger.php">hunger strike</a> and was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-taken-to.php">taken to the hospital</a> [JURIST reports]. Chen, the former leader of the now-opposition <a href="http://www.dpp.org.tw/">Democratic Progressive Party</a> (DPP) [party website, in Mandarin] who resigned the presidency in May 2008, has maintained his innocence and has said that the investigation is a political attack by members of the ruling <a href="http://www.kmt.org.tw/EN_category/eng_category1.html">Kuomintang Party</a> [party website]. Chen spent eight months in prison twenty-one years ago for defaming Nationalist leaders. In September, he was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/former-taiwan-president-cleared-on.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] on more recent defamation charges. Last week, a Taiwanese court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-intelligence-head.php">sentenced a former intelligence head</a> [JURIST report] Yeh Sheng-mao to 10 years in prison on corruption charges. Yeh was convicted of corruption, concealing a government file, and leaking confidential information to Chen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US senators <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/">Carl Levin</a> (D-MI) and <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) [official websites] on Thursday released the <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2008/Detainees.121108.pdf">executive summary</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/release.cfm?id=305735">press release</a>] of a <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] report that says senior US officials are to blame for the use of abusive interrogation techniques against detainees held in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. The report cites a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/020702bush.pdf">February 2002 memorandum</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/white-house-memos-to-cia-approved.php">report</a>] signed by President George W. Bush, stating that the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68!OpenDocument">Third Geneva Convention</a> [text] guaranteeing humane treatment to prisoners of war did not apply to al Qaeda or Taliban detainees, and a <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/dod/gcrums1127120202mem.pdf">December 2002 memo</a> [text, PDF] signed by former Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/rumsfeld-bio.html">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [official profile], approving the use &quot;aggressive techniques&quot; against detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, as key factors that lead to the extensive abuses. Dismissing arguments that the abuses were simply the result of poor decisions by lower-level officers, the committee wrote:<blockquote>The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of &#8220;a few bad apples&#8221; acting on their own.  The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques, redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality, and authorized their use against detainees.  Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives, strengthened the hand of our enemies, and compromised our moral authority.</blockquote>The report said that government officials inappropriately sought out and applied interrogation techniques that US forces were taught to resist - including <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], stress positions, sleep deprivation, and forced nudity - against detainees. It also said that standard reviews of the interrogation policies were circumvented, and that officials sought out legal advice that favored the use of aggressive techniques, while discounting advice which challenged it. The report was unanimously approved by present committee members on November 20, and the remainder of its text is classified.<br /><br />The report is the result the committee&#39;s inquiry into what caused detainee abuses at <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archives] prisons, and follows hearings on the matter in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/dod-lawyer-pushed-for-harsh-detainee.php">June</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/e_witnesslist.cfm?id=3571">September</a> [committee materials]. The Bush administration has received widespread criticism for the contents of <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torturingdemocracy/documents/">various documents</a> [GWU materials] from the Department of Justice, Department of Defense, and Office of Legal Counsel <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=torture+memo">supporting the use of harsh interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive] against detainees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</a> [official website] stock market chairman Bernard Madoff was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December08/madoffarrestpr.pdf">arrested</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] Thursday by federal agents on charges of securities fraud. The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-293.htm">charged</a> [SEC press release] Madoff and his investment firm, <a href="http://www.madoff.com/dis/display.asp?id=203&mode=1&home=1">Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC</a> [corporate website], on Thursday with engaging in a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme. He has been charged with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts]. Madoff allegedly told two employees of his firm Wednesday that his investment advisory business was a fraud. According to the complaint, Madoff &quot;stated that he was &#39;finished,&#39; that he had &#39;absolutely nothing,&#39; that &#39;it&#39;s all just one big lie,&#39; and that it was &#39;basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.&#39;&quot; Madoff was released on bail later Thursday. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January 12.<br /><br />Madoff, 70, founded his investment firm in 1960. He has served as chairman of the board of directors of the NASDAQ stock market and was a member of the board of governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). According to his firm&#39;s website, it ranks among the top 1 percent of US securities firms.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/">Council of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] passed <a href="http://www.dccouncil.us/images/00001/20080716085012.pdf">legislation</a> [introduction, PDF] Tuesday increasing the requirements of gun owners in Washington, DC. The legislation contains a number of provisions that the city council hopes will make it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/us/17gun.html">more difficult for criminals obtain weapons</a> [NYT report] and make it easier for law enforcement officers to track them down. The requirements include owners registering their weapon every three years, receiving five hours of training from a qualified instructor, and undergoing a background check every six years. In addition, the legislation provides that by 2011 certain weapons will be marked to facilitate law enforcement officers in finding violent offenders. The <a href="http://www.nra.org/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] believes that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/16/AR2008121601645.html">the legislation is another example</a> [AP report] of the Council trying to make it harder for law-abiding citizens to own guns. <br /><br />In June, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">prohibited</a> [JURIST report] the District of Columbia from banning private handgun ownership in the landmark case of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF]. The Court found that the Second Amendment bestows upon citizens an individual right to own firearms for lawful purposes. The ruling has not stopped the Council from trying to control gun ownership. Since June, the Council has passed measures to limit the types of weapons that citizens can own, as well as the circumstances under which they are allowed to own them, including a <a href="http://www.dccouncil.us/images/00001/20080924114019.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF] passed in September to restrict the use of guns in the home to self defense purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Senator Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200812/121508b.html">announced</a> [press release] Monday that confirmation hearings for Attorney General nominee <a href="http://www.cov.com/eholder/">Eric Holder</a> [professional profile] will be <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3610">delayed</a> [hearing notice] one week, after Republicans objected that they did not have enough time to review Holder&#39;s record. Hearings were originally scheduled to begin January 8, but will now begin January 15, following a <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=NewsRoom.NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=264c02d4-c9ad-ec8a-7e3a-6a6f2272add0&Region_id=&Issue_id=">request for more time</a> [press release] issued last week by ranking Republican committee member <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">Senator Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) [official website]. Leahy expressed disappointment with the delay, saying:<blockquote>[T]o accommodate the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, at their request we are delaying the hearing, again, until January 15. ... It is disappointing to me that [the Republicans] are insisting that we delay at a time when the nation needs its top law enforcement officer and national security team in place and working. I trust that with this additional time to prepare, they will cooperate in proceeding promptly to Committee and Senate consideration of the historic Holder nomination as Democrats did for President Bush.</blockquote>Also Monday, Holder <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200812/121508c.html">returned</a> [press release] his <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/resources/documents/upload/111th-Holder-Questionnaire-Public.pdf">bipartisan questionnaire</a> [text, PDF] to the Judiciary Committee.<br /><br />After meeting with Holder last week, Leahy said that he hoped to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/holder-ag-confirmation-hearings-to.php">begin the hearings as soon as the Senate reconvened</a> [JURIST report] in January. President-elect Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/obama-confirms-holder-attorney-general.php">officially announced his nomination of Holder</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Holder served as <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/index-dag.html">Deputy US Attorney General</a> [archive materials] during the Clinton administration. Republicans have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/republicans-target-reported-obama-ag.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Holder for his role in the 2001 pardon of fugitive financier <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html">Marc Rich</a> [<font style="font-style: italic;">Time</font> backgrounder]. If confirmed by the Senate, Holder would be the first African-American to lead the Justice Department.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] on Tuesday called for <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/press/releases/2008-12.16.html">greater judicial cooperation to combat piracy</a> [press release] off the coast of Somalia. UNODC Executive Director <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=8">Antonio Maria Costa</a> [official profile] said that while pirates should ideally be tried in their home country or in the country that owns the seized ship, this is not always feasible because, &quot;the Somali criminal justice system has collapsed, and countries like Liberia, Panama, and the Marshall Islands - where many of the ships are registered - do not want to deal with crimes committed thousands of miles away.&quot; Costa proposed strengthening regional justice systems by helping countries implement the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf">UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime</a> [text, PDF] and combating piracy on the land by dismantling pirates&#39; bases and support networks. Costa concluded that, &quot;Piracy is organized crime, and should be confronted as such.&quot; Also on Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/sc9541.doc.htm">resolution authorizing states to use land-based operations</a> [press release and text] to combat piracy in Somalia. The measure, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/17/africa/somalia.php">pushed by the US</a> [IHT report] won unanimous support.<br /><br />Last month, eight suspected <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/suspected-somalia-pirates-captured-by.php">Somali pirates were charged</a> [JURIST report] in a <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/website/index.php">Kenyan court</a> [Kenya judiciary website] after being turned over to Kenyan officials by the British Royal Navy. In October, the UN Security Council unanimously approved <a href="http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/N0853884.pdf">Resolution 1838</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9467.doc.htm">press release</a>], condemning all acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, and calling on states to &quot;deploy naval vessels and military aircraft to actively fight piracy on the high seas off the coast of Somalia.&quot; Although maritime piracy is increasingly widespread, Somalia&#39;s coast has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4584878.stm">ranked as the most dangerous in the world</a> [BBC report] due to a surge in attacks on ships carrying traded goods or <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5052065">humanitarian aid</a> [NPR report]. Somalia has not had an effective government for 17 years. It was recently ranked as <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/myanmar-somalia-ranked-most-corrupt.php">one of the world&#39;s most corrupt countries</a> [JURIST report] and its transitional government has only a tenuous hold over the country&#39;s capital. In October 2007 the <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:welcome-to-the-international-maritime-bureau&catid=25:home&Itemid=16">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [advocacy website], which tracks <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=visualization&controller=visualization.googlemap&Itemid=89&phpMyAdmin=F5XY3CeBeymbElbQ8jr4qlxK1J3">incidents of maritime piracy worldwide</a> [IMP materials], <a href="http://www.iccwbo.org/id16770/index.html?terms=piracy+somalia">reported</a> [press release] that incidents of piracy and armed attacks against ships off the Somalian and Nigerian coasts have risen 14% from 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The legislature in the <a href="http://www.papua.go.id/index.php/id">Papua</a> [official website, in Indonesian] province of <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Indonesia">Indonesia</a> [JURIST news archive] announced Tuesday that it will postpone a decision on whether to implant certain individuals infected with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=HIV">HIV/AIDS</a> [JURIST news archive] with microchips to monitor their movements. A vote scheduled for next week will be put off in response to <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/16/papua-puts-controversial-microchip-plan.html">human rights concerns</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report]. The bill would have attempted to monitor the activities of individuals who are infected with HIV/AIDS whom the government has deemed &quot;sexually aggressive&quot; or more likely to spread the virus. Local officials acknowledged that the policy is extreme but are concerned with the rapid spread of HIV throughout the Papua region, which has the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients in Indonesia. AIDS activists have sharply criticized the policy, which they see as demeaning to people who are living with HIV/AIDS. The legislature is expected to rule on less controversial HIV/AIDS control measures in the coming week. <br /><br />The <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/indonesia-province-weighs-bill-to.php">legislation was introduced</a> [JURIST report] last month. Other countries have also been examining or changing strict policies concerning HIV/AIDS. Indian officials are <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/soldier-challenges-india-army-ban-on.php">investigating the legality</a> [JURIST report] of a ban that prohibits individuals who are HIV positive from serving in the military. China has recently <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/china-to-relax-entry-prohibition.php">relaxed</a> [JURIST report] a ban against entering the country for any person who is HIV-positive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US military reported on Tuesday the <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=24405&Itemid=128">transfer of 39 high-value detainees</a> [press release] from the custody of US-led multinational force to an Iraqi controlled prison. The detainees were all former members of the regime of <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive], and have already been convicted or are scheduled to stand trial at the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=central+criminal+court+of+iraq">Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a> (CCCI) [JURST news archive]. According the US military, the transfer was facilitated by the improvements made in the Iraqi prison system and courts. More than 15,000 detainees remain in the custody of the coalition.<br /><br />The recent transfer of detainees to the Iraqi government is part of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">passed last month</a> [JURIST report]. Under the SOFA, the coalition must transfer the remaining detainees into the custody of the Iraqi government. Detainees who have not been charged with a crime will be released. A recent <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] report <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/rights-group-claims-iraq-courts-fail-to.php">criticized the CCCI</a> [JURIST report], stating that detainees often wait months or even years before standing trial. The report also alleged that trials in the CCCI often do not meet international fair trial standards.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] on Tuesday said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard Madoff went undetected for so long. The SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">filed charges</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>] last week in New York against Madoff and his firm, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071019050645/http://www.madoff.com/">Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC</a> [archived website] for an alleged $50 billion fraud scheme. Cox said:<blockquote>Since Commissioners were first informed of the Madoff investigation last week, the Commission has met multiple times on an emergency basis to seek answers to the question of how Mr. Madoff&#39;s vast scheme remained undetected by regulators and law enforcement for so long. Our initial findings have been deeply troubling. The Commission has learned that credible and specific allegations regarding Mr. Madoff&#8217;s financial wrongdoing, going back to at least 1999, were repeatedly brought to the attention of SEC staff, but were never recommended to the Commission for action. I am gravely concerned by the apparent multiple failures over at least a decade to thoroughly investigate these allegations or at any point to seek formal authority to pursue them.</blockquote>Cox announced that there would be a &quot;full and immediate review&quot; of these allegations. The SEC will also look into relationships between SEC officials and Madoff&#39;s family members, including Madoff&#39;s niece, who married a former SEC lawyer in 2007. In related news, Madoff is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSN1646419620081216">scheduled to appear in court</a> [Reuters report] Wednesday for a bail hearing.<br /><br />On Saturday, UK financial firm <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/">Bramdean Alternatives Limited</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/news/send_attachment/48">raised concerns</a> [statement, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/uk-financial-institution-assails-us.php">report</a>] about the US financial regulatory process after its value dropped by more than 35 percent following news of its exposure to the fraud. Madoff has been charged with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts]. Madoff allegedly told two employees of his firm last week that his investment advisory business was &quot;basically, a giant Ponzi scheme.&quot; Madoff, 70, founded his investment firm in 1960. He has served as chairman of the board of directors of the <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/">NASDAQ</a> [official website] stock market and was a member of the board of governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). According to his firm&#39;s website, it ranked among the top 1 percent of US securities firms.

The transfer follows a November <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1166-276">ruling</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-judge-orders-five-guantanamo.php">report</a>] by Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/leon-bio.html">Richard Leon</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] that five Algerian detainees must be released immediately. The three men, Mustafa Ait Idir, Mohamed Nechla, and Hadj Boudella were transferred to Bosnia Tuesday night, while two others remain in custody. The three transferred detainees are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gGotzoZe_qi25M1jrAtQ1lnOFVSAD953VB5O0">expected to be released</a> [AP report] to their families.<br /><br />One of the remaining two detainees is Lakhdar Boumediene, the man at the center of the US Supreme Court&#39;s landmark decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>], in which the Court ruled that federal courts have jurisdiction to review <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions filed by Guantanamo detainees who have been classified as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; Leon ruled in November that five of six detainees should be released because the government&#39;s evidence was insufficient to persuade him that the men were planning to travel to Afghanistan to join al Qaeda and were not properly classified as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; Leon ordered that a sixth detainee, Belkacem ben Sayah, remain in custody because the government&#39;s evidence against him was sufficient to label him an enemy combatant. In October, Leon <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/boumediene-order-10-27-08.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-rules-on-meaning-of-enemy.php">report</a>] that in order to be validly held as &quot;enemy combatants,&quot; Guantanamo Bay detainees must have directly supported hostilities against the US or its allies, setting the standard that the government must use to justify their detention.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladeshi President and head of the military backed interim government <a href="http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/pprofile.html">Iajuddin Ahmed</a> [official profile] on Monday signed the Emergency Powers (Repeal) Ordinance 2008, lifting a two-year state of emergency in order to prepare for December 29 parliamentary elections. The state of emergency, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bangladesh-president-declares-state-of.php">declared in January 2007</a> [JURIST report], suspended democratic rights throughout the country. The Ordinance, which takes effect Wednesday, will enable candidates to conduct their campaigns. The signing was announced on Tuesday, and coincides with the sixteenth anniversary of Bangladeshi independence. Last week, the clauses of the Emergency Powers rule governing meetings and rallies were lifted to facilitate campaigning. Foreign diplomats have asked the government to <a href="http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=3&id=71465&hb=3">provide them with better security</a> [BDNews24 report] in the wake of the emergency rule being lifted.<br /><br />In November, the emergency rule was briefly lifted, but was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/bangladesh-bans-demonstrations.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] after violent protests when political party leaders from <a href="http://jamaat-e-islami.org/index.php">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> [party website] party were arrested on alleged corruption charges in relation to a coal mining contract. Elections were originally scheduled for December 18, but as a result of pressure that included threats to boycott the polls from the major political alliances <a href="http://www.albd.org/aldoc/50years.htm">Awami League</a> and <a href="http://www.bnpbd.com/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> [party websites], led by former prime ministers <a href="http://www.cwwl.org/bio_Hasina-Sheikh.html">Sheikh Hasina</a> [CWWL profile] and <a href="http://www.un.int/bangladesh/gen/pm-bio.htm">Khaleda Zia</a> [UN profile], respectively, they were rescheduled for the current December 29 date.

Mukasey</u>, concerned the applicability of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002709----000-.html">statute</a> [18 U.S.C. &sect; 2709, text] containing a blanket prohibition  against the disclosure of an NSL sent by the FBI to John Doe, Inc. The NSL was withdrawn by the FBI in November 2006, and in subsequent litigation, the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/nsldecision.pdf">invalidated the statute</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/federal-judge-rules-patriot-act.php">report</a>] as a violation of the First Amendment. In Monday&#39;s opinion, <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/Judgesbio.htm#JON">Judge Jon Newman</a> [official profile] wrote:<blockquote>The nondisclosure requirement of subsection 2709(c) is not a typical prior restraint or a typical content-based restriction warranting the most rigorous First Amendment scrutiny. On the other hand, the Government&#8217;s analogies to nondisclosure prohibitions in other contexts do not persuade us to use a significantly diminished standard of review. In any event, John Doe, Inc., has been restrained from publicly expressing a category of information, albeit a narrow one, and that information is relevant to intended criticism of a governmental activity.</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which represented the plaintiff in the case, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/nsaspying/38113prs20081215.html">called the verdict</a> [ACLU press release] a &quot;major victory for the rule of law.&quot; The <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/12/second-circuit-rules-against-national-security-let">applauded the decision</a> [EFF press release], calling it &quot;another setback to the Bush Administration&#39;s claims for sweeping new Executive powers.&quot;<br /><br />The FBI <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/fbi-withdraws-national-security-letter.php">withdrew a similar NSL</a> [JURIST report] in May as part of a settlement with the <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">Internet Archive</a> [archive website] that lifted a gag order preventing the parties from speaking about the NSL. A review of FBI use of NSLs by the Justice Department found that a number of them were <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/doj-review-finds-improper-fbi-use-of.php">used improperly</a> [JURIST report], and that such improper usage had increased in 2006 compared to previous years. A <em>New York Times</em> report in September 2007 showed that FBI electronic surveillance within the US was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/washington/09fbi.html?ex=1347076800&en=fefa8f68a7779332&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink">more widespread</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/fbi-telecom-surveillance-wider-than.php">report</a>] than previously thought.

Nelson and another Marine, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Weemer">Sgt.

A third marine, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nazario">Sgt. Jose Nazario</a>, faced charges for the same incident. Because he was no longer in the military, Nazario was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ex-marine-charged-with-voluntary.php">charged with two counts of voluntary manslaughter</a> [JURIST report] in civilian court.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Israeli Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday ruled that the government must change the proposed route for its West Bank <a href="http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/default.htm">security barrier</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=security+fence+%2Bisrael">news archive</a>], finding that the current plan encroaches too much on Palestinian territory. The court <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1228728207923&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">found the government in contempt</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] for failing to follow its <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/israel-high-court-orders-partial-re.php">previous instructions</a> [JURIST report] to infringe on as little Palestinian land as possible. The case involves the Palestinian village of Bilin. Residents had originally challenged the construction of the wall on the grounds that the planned route of the barrier prevented some Bilin residents from accessing their fields and orchards, thereby preventing the villagers from earning a livelihood. The court ruled Monday that the government&#39;s latest proposed route still infringed on the residents&#39; rights.<br /><br />The contested portion in Bilin is just 500 acres of a 410-mile wall along the West Bank border, which Israel began to construct in 2002 to keep suicide bombers from entering Israeli territory. The barrier has been denounced by Palestinians as a land grab and an &quot;apartheid wall&quot; breaking up communities and families, but Israeli officials insist it is necessary to prevent terrorist attacks. In 2006, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/israel-high-court-orders-state-to.php">dismantle another section of the wall</a> [JURIST report] in the northern West Bank, but Israeli courts have also <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/israel-high-court-rejects-petition.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] petitions by Palestinians when security concerns outweighed the Palestinians&#39; objections. In 2004, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/icjhome.htm">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] issued a non-binding <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&k=5a&case=131&code=mwp&p3=4">advisory opinion</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/update-world-court-rules-west-bank.htm">report</a>] that parts of the wall should be torn down.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/en/enmain.htm">Hungarian Constitutional Court</a> [official website] on Monday struck down a law that would have given certain rights to same-sex couples, ruling that it diminishes the importance of marriage. The law, <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/hungarian-parliament-allows-same-sex.php">passed last year</a> [JURIST report], would have recognized civil partnerships between same-sex couples and unmarried couples, giving them the same inheritance, tax, and financial rights as married heterosexual couples. The law was scheduled to go into effect on January 1, 2009. After the ruling was handed down, <a href="http://www.meh.hu/english/primeminister">Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany</a> [official profile] asked the Justice Minister to <a href="http://www.nepszava.hu/default.asp?cCenter=OnlineCikk.asp&ArticleID=1132704">draft new legislation</a> [<em>Nepszava</em> report, in Hungarian] that would comport with the court&#39;s decision while providing benefits to domestic partners.<br /><br /><a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] <em>per se</em> is not recognized in any of Europe&#39;s former eastern-bloc states, although the Czech Republic and Slovenia do recognize registered same-sex partnerships.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/">Illinois House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 113-0 Monday to begin an inquiry into whether <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] should be impeached. House Speaker <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/Rep.asp?GA=95&MemberID=1172">Michael Madigan</a> [official profile] appointed a committee that will begin its investigation Tuesday, gathering evidence and testimony related to the charges. Hearings are <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-blagojevich-main16dec16,0,1781213.story">expected to continue</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] for several weeks. If the committee recommends impeachment, it will go to a vote before the entire House. If the House votes to impeach, the proceedings will go before the Senate, which will act as a jury with the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court presiding. This is Illinois&#39;s first impeachment inquiry of a governor.<br /><br />Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] last week by federal agents on <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01a.pdf">charges of corruption</a> [complaint, PDF]. Both Blagojevich and Harris have been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the senate seat left vacant by Obama and obtaining illegal campaign contributions. They are also accused of threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Harris <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gQcHXIYZaU58UDPVEzCi2aqMShDQD951BG4G0">resigned</a> his position Friday, while Blagojevich has continued to report to work. Also on Friday, Illinois Attorney General <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Lisa Madigan</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/MOTION_FOR%20TRO_12-12-2008_10-19-24.pdf">motion</a> [motion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-ag-asks-state-supreme-court-to.php">report</a>] with the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] to have Blagojevich declared unfit and removed temporarily from office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Malaysian government on Monday introduced a <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/billindexbi/pdf/DR302008E.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would set up a committee to discipline judges who violate the country&#39;s judicial ethics code. The Judges&#39; Ethics Committee Bill 2008 was <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsgeneral.php?id=378432">tabled</a> [<em>Bernama</em> reoprt] Monday by the <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/eng-dR-maklumatumum.htm">Dewan Rakyat</a> [official website], the Malaysian parliament, and will be considered at a later date. If passed, the legislation would allow judges suspected of an ethics violation to be referred to the committee, which would hold an in camera review of the judge&#39;s conduct. <br /><br />The bill comes amid widespread allegations of corruption in the Malaysian justice system. Malaysian opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3618586.stm">Anwar Ibrahim</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anwar+ibrahim">news archive</a>], who faces sodomy charges, has <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-denounces.php">denounced the system</a> [JURIST report], saying he has no confidence in it. Last week, Malaysian Prime Minister <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/12/11/parliament/2772961&sec=parliament">introduced</a> [<em>Malaysia Star</em> report] the <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/billindexbi/pdf/DR272008E.pdf">Judicial Appointments Commission bill</a> [text, PDF], that sets up a committee for appointing judges. That bill has also been tabled.

Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>]. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200801/06-5209a.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-torture.php">report</a>] on the case five months before <u>Boumediene</u> was decided, holding that four former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees do not have the right to sue high-ranking government officials for alleged torture and infringement of religious practice during their captivity. In <u>Boumediene</u>, the Court held that federal courts have jurisdiction to review <em>habeas corpus</em> petitions filed by Guantanamo detainees who have been classified as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot;<br /><br />UK citizens Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal, Rhuhel Ahmed, and Jamal Al-Harith were released from Guantanamo in March 2004. In May 2004, Rasul and Iqbal said in an open letter to US President George W. Bush that they had <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/britons-claim-abuses-at-guantanamo.htm">suffered abuse at Guantanamo</a> [JURIST report] similar to that perpetrated at <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive] prison in Iraq.

The court dismissed the plaintiffs&#39; claims under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_21B.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> [text], finding that they did not have the right to sue for infringement of religious rights because they are aliens who were not in the US at the time of the alleged acts.

Good</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-cigarette-labeling.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch36.html">Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act</a> [text] does not bar state lawsuits based on allegedly deceptive cigarette advertising. The case was brought by three Maine smokers who accused <a href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx">Philip Morris</a> [corporate website] of presenting light cigarettes as less harmful than they really are. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority:<blockquote>We conclude . . . that the Labeling Act does not pre-empt state-law claims like respondents&#39; that are predicated on the duty not to deceive. We also hold that the FTC&#39;s various decisions with respect to statements of tar and nicotine content do not impliedly pre-empt respondents&#39; claim. Respondents still must prove that petitioners&#39; use of &quot;light&quot; and &quot;lowered tar&quot; descriptors in fact violated the state deceptive practices statute, but neither the Labeling Act&#39;s pre-emption provision nor the FTC&#39;s actions in this field prevent a jury from considering that claim.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent, in which Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Justice Samuel Alito joined. Thomas wrote:<blockquote>Applying the proper test &#8212; i.e., whether a jury verdict on respondents&#39; claims would &quot;impos[e] an obligation&quot; on the cigarette manufacturer &quot;because of the effect of smoking upon health,&quot; respondents&#39; state-law claims are expressly pre-empted by &sect; 5(b) of the Labeling Act. [citations omitted]</blockquote>The decision upholds a <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=06-1965.01A">ruling</a> [opinion text] by the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, reinstating the lawsuit that the district court dismissed as pre-empted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] lawyer Thomas Tamm told <em>Newsweek</em> in an article published Sunday that he blew the whistle on the Bush administration&#39;s controversial <A src="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">warrantless domestic surveillance program</A> [JURIST news archive] because <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/174601">&quot;it didn&#39;t smell right&quot;</a> [<em>Newsweek</em> report]. <em>Newsweek</em> said that Tamm, whose home was raided last year by federal agents, said that he leaked information about the program to the <em>New York Times</em> 18 months before the <em>Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?_r=1&ei=5065&en=654a454e2d208a6b&ex=1135400400&adxnnl=1&partner=MYWAY&adxnnlx=1134739513-Obc9tUfV7gxbxI+OkySwyg">broke the story</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/bush-authorized-warrantless-phone.php">report</a>] about the program in 2005. Tamm, who left the DOJ in 2006, said, &quot;I thought this [secret program] was something the other branches of the government &#8212; and the public &#8212; ought to know about. So they could decide: do they want this massive spying program to be taking place?&quot; He called it &quot;stunning&quot; that officials higher up did not blow the whistle sooner.<br /><br />Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-judge-orders-release-of.php">ordered the DOJ to release legal memoranda</a> [JURIST report] relating to the warrantless domestic surveillance program. In December 2007, the <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/fisc_bdy!OpenDocument&Click=">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> (FISC) [official backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/fisa-court-rules-against-making.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/aclu-asks-fisc-to-unseal-rulings.php">motion</a> [JURIST report] asking the court to &quot;disclose recent legal opinions discussing the scope of the government&#39;s authority to engage in secret wiretapping of Americans.&quot; In September, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/class-action-lawsuit-filed-over-us.php">class action suit was filed</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] seeking injunctive, declaratory, and equitable relief against the program. A <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/e-privacy-group-sues-att-for-opening.php">previous class action suit</a> [JURIST report] had been filed in 2006. In 2007, former head of the DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/facdir.php?id=559">Jack Landman Goldsmith</a> [academic profile] testified before the <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/ex-doj-lawyer-doubts-legal-basis-of.php">&quot;could not find the legal support for&quot;</a> [JURIST report] portions of warrantless domestic surveillance program during his tenure with DOJ.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided Thursday over the the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ga10801.doc.htm">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [press release] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement. The representative from Argentina, speaking on behalf of primarily European and Latin American countries, including the UK, Germany, and Brazil, read a statement urging states to:<blockquote>take all the necessary measures, in particular legislative or administrative, to ensure that sexual orientation or gender identity may under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties, in particular executions, arrests or detention.</blockquote>The representative from Syria, speaking on behalf of primarily African and Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Egypt, read a statement affirming universal principles of human rights but expressing concern over attempts to introduce notions &quot;that have no legal foundation in any international human rights instrument.&quot; The US signed neither statement. The statements remained open for signatures, no resolution was drafted, and no voting occurred on the issue. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] said Thursday that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29364&Cr=pillay&Cr1=">too many countries continue to criminalize homosexual behavior</a> [press release]. Pillay said:<blockquote>The ageless cliche that everyone is equal but some are more equal than others is not acceptable. No human being should be denied their human rights simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. No human being should be subject to discrimination, violence, criminal sanctions or abuse simply because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.</blockquote>Gay rights have been a contentious issue worldwide with little global consensus. Last month, the parliament of <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/burundi-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Burundi criminalized homosexuality</a>, and the Supreme Court of <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nepal-supreme-court-approves-same-sex.php">Nepal approved same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST reports]. In October, the Portuguese parliament voted overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/portugal-parliament-votes-down.php">against proposals to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In the US, same-sex marriages are now permitted in Massachusetts and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/connecticut-judge-signs-off-on-same-sex.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST report]. In November, same-sex marriage bans <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in California, Arizona, and Florida, leading to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/us/16protest.html">nationwide demonstrations</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/demonstrators-protest-california-same.php">report</a>] and a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-ag-urges-state-high-court-to.php">call from California&#39;s Attorney General</a> [JURIST report] for the California Supreme Court to examine challenges to the ban&#39;s legality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of judges at the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] ruled Wednesday that there was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tdec/en/081217.pdf">no valid immunity deal</a> [decision, PDF] between war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf">backgrounder</a>; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] and US ambassador to the UN <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/bio/holbrooke_bio.html">Richard Holbrooke</a> [PBS profile] and that even if such an agreement had existed, it would not be valid under international law. Judge Iain Bonomy wrote:<blockquote>The Trial Chamber notes the vague nature of the Accused&#39;s submissions in relation to the alleged agreement. In particular, in the Official Submission the Accused states repeatedly and emphatically that &quot;there is no doubt that this offer was made in the name of the USA&quot; and refers to the alleged agreement as being &quot;between the USA and me&quot;, but in the Motion he argues he is &quot;the beneficiary of ... a specific agreement not to prosecute him as an individual&quot; and that the alleged agreement is attributable to the ICTY. The Accused does not specify in what form the agreement was made. The Accused indicates that he intends to demonstrate &quot;the effective control of the United States over the peace process in Bosnia from August 1995 ... [and] the relationship between the United States and the ICTY OTP&quot; in order to draw a connection between the actions of Mr. Holbrooke in his capacity as a representative of the United States and either the United Nations, its member states or the Office of the Prosecutor of the Tribunal. The Trial Chamber considers that the Accused makes no <em>prima facie</em> showing of that connection, and appears to have misinterpreted the law on this point.<br /><br />The Trial Chamber considers it well established that any immunity agreement in respect of an accused indicted for genocide, war crimes and/or crimes against humanity before an international tribunal would be invalid under international law. The Trial Chamber further considers that, pursuant to the Statute and Rules of the Tribunal, neither its own mandate nor that of the Prosecutor is affected by any alleged undertaking made by Mr. Holbrooke.<br /><br />The Trial Chamber concludes that this argument is without substantive basis, and therefore that information that the Accused may intend to use in support of it is not material to the preparation of the defence in this respect.</blockquote>The panel ruled, however, that prosecutors must turn over to Karadzic any notes, agreements, or recordings related to the alleged immunity deal, in response to an <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/submisions/080923b.pdf">October motion</a> [motion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/karadzic-seeks-icty-information-on.php">report</a>] by Karadzic. In August, Karadzic <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/karadzic/trialc/submisions/080805.pdf">alleged that Holbrooke agreed</a> [submission, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-asks-tribunal-to-order.php">report</a>] in 1996 that Karadzic would not face war crimes charges if he removed himself from power. It is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gfog99sG-4NVtaT3GNxSpZ0V33KAD9552KLG0">unclear whether Karadzic will appeal</a> [AP report] the panel decision. Prosecutors do not plan to appeal the turnover ruling.<br /><br />Karadzic faces 11 <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/kar-ai000428e.pdf">charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation, and &quot;other inhumane acts,&quot; for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, including the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>]. Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">filed a motion to amend the indictment</a> [JURIST report] in September, in hopes of simplifying the proceedings. Karadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. He was originally indicted in 1995 but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report]. He repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">refused to enter a plea</a> on the charges, with an ICTY judge eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-again-refuses-to-enter-pleas.php">entering a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST reports] on his behalf. If the court approves the amended indictment, Karadzic will be asked to enter new pleas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.yargitay.gov.tr/english/aboutus.php">Turkish Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday overturned the conviction of a lawyer accused of killing a judge and merged the case with the trial of a right-wing group accused of plotting a coup. Alparslan Arslan was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/turkish-lawyer-sentenced-to-life-in.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> in February for the May 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/gunman-opens-fire-at-turkish-high.php">killing of Judge Mustafa Yucel Ozbilgin</a> in protest of a February 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/turkish-pm-slams-court-ruling-denying.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the court permitting a school to deny promotion to a teacher because she wore a religious headscarf. Arslan&#39;s case will be merged with the trial of 86 defendants accused of attempting to destabilize and overthrow the country&#39;s ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website]. The accused are said to belong to the secular <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder] group, believed responsible for bombing the headquarters of the newspaper <em><a href="http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?em=cumhuriyet/w/c01.html">Cumhuriyet</a></em> [newspaper website, in Turkish], assassinating Turkish-Armenian journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hrant+Dink">news archive</a>], and planning other attacks to provoke a military coup to topple the AKP. The court found that the <a href="http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/10583118.asp?scr=1">killing of the judge and the coup plot are related</a> [<em>Hurriyet</em> report] and consolidated the cases. The issue will now be <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161491&bolum=100">whether the case should be heard in Ankara</a> [<em>Today&#39;s Zaman</em> report], where Arslan was originally convicted, or in Istanbul, where the coup trial is taking place.<br /><br />The alleged members of Ergenekon were <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in July. Among them are journalists, intellectuals, and <a href="http://www.ip.org.tr/">Turkish Workers&#39; Party</a> [party website, in Turkish] leader <a href="http://www.doguperincek.gen.tr/">Dogu Perincek</a> [personal website, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/turkish-politician-charged-over-alleged.php">report</a>]. Two <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">former generals were also arrested</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the alleged plot. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">trial began</a> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-resumes-trial-of-alleged-coup.php">resumed</a> [JURIST reports] after being adjourned because of &quot;chaos&quot; in the courtroom.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] has ordered the Pentagon to draft <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52395">a proposal for shutting down</a> [press release] the military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in preparation for a possible order from <a href="http://change.gov/">President-elect Barack Obama</a> [transition website], a Pentagon spokesperson said Thursday. Press Secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters that Gates wants to have a plan in place in the event Obama issues an order shortly after his inauguration to close the facility. Morrell said:<blockquote>[Gates] has asked his team for a proposal on how to shut it down [and] what would be required specifically to close it and move the detainees from that facility, while at the same time ensuring that we protect the American people from some very dangerous characters.</blockquote><a href="http://aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] Executive Director Anthony Romero <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38141prs20081218.html?s_src=HP">applauded the move</a> [press release], saying:<blockquote>The fact that Defense Secretary Gates is finally taking steps to close down Guantanamo and its unconstitutional military commissions is a welcome and encouraging sign that President-elect Obama intends to fulfill his campaign pledge. This is an important first step toward turning the page on eight years of shameful policies that allowed torture and violations of domestic and international law.</blockquote>Also Thursday, the ACLU, along with <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International USA</a>, <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a>, and <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/38140prs20081218.html?s_src=HP">letter</a> [press release and text] to Obama calling on him not to create a similar detention system, should he close Guantanamo and end the military commissions system.<br /><br />On Sunday, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/chertoff-bio.html">Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile] told the BBC that before closing the Guantanamo prison, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7782240.stm">Obama must have a plan for dealing with the detainees</a> [transcript text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/chertoff-insists-obama-must-have-plan.php">report</a>]. Last week Portugal&#39;s foreign minister said that his country would be <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">willing to take in</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees if Obama closed the facility, and encouraged other European Union member states to do the same. Rights groups have urged Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month the ACLU launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Also in November, HRW called upon Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">denounce Bush administration counterterrorism policies</a> [JURIST report] that they described as &quot;abusive.&quot; Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Canadian <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Index">Federal Court</a> [official website] judge ruled Thursday that the <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/index-eng.asp">Canadian Security Intelligence Service</a> (CSIS) [official website] must stop monitoring phone calls between terrorism suspects and their lawyers and must erase any such calls that it accidentally records. <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Layden-Stevenson">Judge Carolyn Layden-Stevenson</a> [official profile] on Thursday morning released a two-page summary of testimony given during a secret hearing Wednesday that revealed that CSIS had been monitoring conversations between suspects and their lawyers. Layden-Stevenson issued an order later Tuesday putting a stop to the practice. A CSIS lawyer said that CSIS would <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081218.wcsis1218/BNStory/National/home">comply with the order</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] and would stop listening to future conversations between lawyers and clients as soon as the nature of the conversation became apparent.<br /><br />The issue arose in the case of Mohammad Mahjoub, an Egyptian detainee suspected of ties to al Qaeda who had been held since 2000. Mahjoub was <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/15/court-mahjoub.html?ref=rss">released on bail</a> [CBC report] in April 2007. Leading up to his release, he agreed to have his phone calls monitored so authorities could ensure he was not a threat to national security, but his lawyers did not realize that phone calls between them and their client would be intercepted.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  The <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">Venezuelan National Assembly</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Thursday gave preliminary approval to a measure authorizing a national referendum on a constitutional amendment that would <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=20813&Itemid=59">abolish presidential term limits</a> [press release, in Spanish]. The amendment would allow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">news archive</a>] to seek re-election in 2012.  Also on Thursday, a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aQt7593qrhwI&refer=latin_america">petition signed by almost five million people</a> [Bloomberg report] endorsing the amendment was given to the National Assembly, while thousands of members of Chavez&#39;s United Socialist Party gathered in Caracas to show support.  The referendum is ultimately expected to be approved when it is debated again in parliament next month.  The opposition has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ineO86qjg0ALoP2esPQbJjn1J5tgD955HHSO2">said the referendum is unlawful</a> [AP report] since term limits were <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/venezuelans-reject-proposed.php">voted down</a> [JURIST report] last year.      <br /><br />In 2007 Venezuelans rejected the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Venezuela+constitution+reforms">constitutional reforms</a> [JURIST news archive] proposed by Chavez by a narrow margin of 51 to 49 percent. At that time Chavez, accepting his first electoral defeat, acknowledged that his proposed reforms, which would have allowed him to stand indefinitely for re-election, handpick local leaders under a new political map, create new types of communal property, and to suspend civil liberties during states of emergency, were &quot;quite profound and intense,&quot; and noted that he may have been too ambitious in his proposals. Chavez touted the constitutional changes as necessary to advance Venezuela&#39;s socialist revolution.  Opposition politicians <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/venezuela-opposition-criticizes.php">accused Chavez</a> [JURIST report] of using the constitutional reforms to consolidate his power.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Argentine court Thursday released 14 suspects who are accused of committing human rights violations during the country&#39;s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.  The court <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE4BH6W5.html">released the men pending bail</a> [Reuters report], saying that the two-year legal deadline for holding them without a conviction had expired.  The suspects are said to have committed human rights violations during Argentina&#39;s so-called <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">&quot;Dirty War&quot;</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war+argentina">news archive</a>].  Among those to be released on bail were <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/alfredo_astiz_311.html">Alfredo Astiz</a> [Trial Watch profile] and Jorge Acosta, who worked at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7026833.stm">Naval Mechanics School</a> (ESMA) [BBC backgrounder] where thousands were tortured and killed. Argentine <a href="http://www.cristina.com.ar/">President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner</a> [official website, in Spanish] deplored the ruling, which the government has said it will <a href="http://www.casarosada.gov.ar/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5377&Itemid=66">appeal</a> [press release, in Spanish].<br /><br />It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the Argentine government&#39;s campaign against suspected dissidents during the country&#39;s &quot;Dirty War.&quot; In 2005, Argentina&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">struck down amnesty laws</a> [JURIST report] adopted in the 1980s to protect potential defendants, prompting the government to reopen hundreds of human rights cases. In March, Argentine politician and former police chief Luis Abelardo Patti was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/argentina-police-arrest-former-police.php">arrested</a> for crimes allegedly committed during the period. In May, Juan Evaristo Puthod, a victim of the violent suppression, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/missing-argentina-dirty-war-witness.php">kidnapped but later released</a> [JURIST reports] before testifying in a third case. In July, an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-life.php">sentenced former general Luciano Benjamin Menendez</a> and four others to life in prison for the 1977 kidnapping, torture, and killing of four political dissidents during the &quot;Dirty War,&quot; and in August, a court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/argentina-ex-generals-convicted-of.php">convicted Mendendez and another former general</a> [JURIST reports] and sentenced them to life terms for kidnapping, torturing, and murdering Peronist politician Guillermo Vargas Aignasse in 1976 during the coup.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] said Thursday that the tribunal may not be able to meet the UN deadline of 2010 for completing its work. Brammertz said that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">July arrest</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; ICTY <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/cis/en/cis_karadzic_en.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karadzic">news archive</a>] may make it necessary for the tribunal to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jSx8qp4LxXvIox7iH4Nfujk9ghoAD95590580">remain open until 2012</a> [AP report]. Brammertz also said that the tribunal has been faced with many staff resignations, including the resignation of many experienced lawyers. Last week Brammertz told the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] that the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29298&Cr=criminal+tribunal&Cr1=">tribunal would need cooperation</a> [UN News Centre report] from former Yugoslavian states as well as the international community to complete its work. He later told reporters that pending <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2008/081212_Tribunals.doc.htm">appeals could continue through 2012</a> [press release]. Also last week, the Security Council unanimously adopted <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9534.doc.htm">resolution 1849 (2008)</a> [press release and text], which will allow the total number of ad litem judges to temporarily exceed the maximum of 12 provided for in the tribunal&#8217;s statute, to a maximum of 16 at any one time, returning to a maximum of 12 by February 28, 2009.<br /><br />Two war crimes suspects, Bosnian Serb General <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/mladic/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials; ICTY <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/mladic/CIS-mladic.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF] and Croatian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/hadzic/4">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY materials; ICTY <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/cases-e/cis/hadzic/cis-hadzic.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF], remain at large, and their capture is a top priority of the ICTY. In addition, the trial of Karadzic is expected to be one of the most complicated cases the ICTY has handled. Karadzic faces 11 <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/kar-ai000428e.pdf">charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF], including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation, and &quot;other inhumane acts,&quot; for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, including the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>]. Prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">filed a motion to amend the indictment</a> [JURIST report] in September, in hopes of simplifying the proceedings. Karadzic was arrested in July after evading capture for nearly 13 years. He was originally indicted in 1995 but had been in hiding under an assumed identity as an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7520661.stm">alternative medicine practitioner</a> [BBC report]. He repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">refused to enter a plea</a> on the charges, with an ICTY judge eventually <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/karadzic-again-refuses-to-enter-pleas.php">entering a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST reports] on his behalf. If the court approves the amended indictment, Karadzic will be asked to enter new pleas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Italian court in Milan Thursday sentenced <A HREF="http://www.parmalat.com/">Parmalat SpA</A> [corporate website; JURIST <A src="/jurist_search.php?q=parmalat">news archive</A>] founder <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/424/000025349/">Calisto Tanzi</a> [NNDB profile] to 10 years in prison for his role in the collapse of the Italian dairy giant. Tanzi is the first executive to be sentenced in connection with the &#8364;14 billion fraud scheme in 2003 that bankrupted the company. He was convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy and criminal association for allegedly concealing the company&#39;s debt. Seven <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_dicembre_18/parmalat_tanzi_condannato_cb2ad79e-cd32-11dd-95df-00144f02aabc.shtml">other defendants were acquitted</a> [<em>Corriere Della Sera</em> report, in Italian], including three former <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp">Bank of America</a> [corporate website] employees and the former head of Parmalat Venezuela. An eighth corporate defendant, former Parmalat auditor Italaudit, was fined &#8364;240,000 and had &#8364;455,000 confiscated.<br /><br />Parmalat filed for insolvency in December 2003 after discovering accounting discrepancies totaling nearly $5 billion in debt. Tanzi was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/italy-judge-indicts-parmalat-founder.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] along with approximately 20 other executives in July 2007. In June 2007, an Italian judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/italy-judge-charges-four-banks-in.php">indicted four banks</a> [JURIST report] - Citigroup, UBS, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank - in connection with the fraud. Suits and counter-suits have been filed in both Italy and the US against a number of parties, including <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/parmalat-sues-citigroup-for-its-role.htm">Citigroup</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/federal-judge-allows-parmalat-suit.php">Bank of America</a> [JURIST reports]. Bank of America is <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/judge-allows-bank-of-america-to-pursue.php">pursuing a counterclaim</a> [JURIST report] against Parmalat, alleging the company engaged in fraud and is maliciously suing the bank to shift blame. In November 2006, a US district judge directed the companies to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/us-judge-directs-financial.php">seek a settlement</a> [JURIST report], but <a href="http://www.flex-news-food.com/pages/19865/Parmalat/boa-no-settlement-parmalat---report.html">no settlement has been reached</a> [Reuters report]. In April, a New Jersey Superior Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/parmalat-fraud-suit-against-citigroup.php">judge ruled that a $7 billion lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by Parmalat against Citigroup could go forward on a claim that Citigroup aided and abetted former Parmalat executives in misappropriating company money. In May, <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/parmalat-reaches-settlement-with.php">Parmalat reached a &#8364;24 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with its shareholders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] India&#39;s upper house of parliament the <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website] on Thursday approved two anti-terrorism bills in response to the recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder]. One bill, the <a href="http://164.100.47.4/Bios_Search/Bill_texts_pre.aspx?Bill_ID=3230&House=Lok%20Sabha">Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment of 2008</a> (UAPA) [legislative materials] will allow the government to hold terrorism suspects for up to 180 days, and the other bill will set up a National Investigation Agency to conduct anti-terror probes. Proponents of the UAPA have said that there are <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=7ce484f2-a63c-41ce-8556-fd7933089469">safeguards in place</a> [<em>Hindustan Times</em> report] to make sure that the new law is not misused. India&#39;s lower house the <a href="http://loksabha.nic.in/">Lok Sabha</a> [official website] approved the legislation on Wednesday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://change.gov/">President-elect Barack Obama</a> [transition website] on Thursday <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president-elect_obama_names_key_regulatory_appointments/">named</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/Leadership/p009733">Mary Schapiro</a> [professional profile] as the Chairman of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website]. Schapiro is currently the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the <a href="http://www.finra.org/index.htm">Financial Industrial Regulatory Authority</a> (FINRA) [organization website], an independent regulator of US securities firms. Schapiro&#39;s appointment comes at a time of financial turmoil in the US and concern about the SEC&#39;s regulatory process in the wake of <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">charges filed</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>] against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] and his securities firm for an alleged $50 billion fraud scheme. Obama said:<blockquote>In the last few days, the alleged scandal at Madoff Investment Securities has reminded us yet again of how badly reform is needed when it comes to the rules and regulations that govern our markets. Charities that invested in Madoff could end up losing savings on which millions depend &#8211; a massive fraud that was made possible in part because the regulators who were assigned to oversee Wall Street dropped the ball. And if the financial crisis has taught us anything, it&#8217;s that this failure of oversight and accountability doesn&#8217;t just harm the individuals involved, it has the potential to devastate our entire economy. That&#8217;s a failure we cannot afford.<br /><br />Financial regulatory reform will be one of the top legislative priorities of my Administration, and as a symbol of how important I view this reform, I&#8217;m announcing these appointments months earlier than previous administrations have. [Schapiro] will help put in place new, common-sense rules of the road that will protect investors, consumers, and our entire economy from fraud and manipulation by an irresponsible few.</blockquote>Schapiro previously served as an SEC commissioner and as Chairman of the <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> [official website].<br /><br />Schapiro will replace current SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile], who said Tuesday that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-launching-investigation-of-failure.php">report</a>] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long. The SEC will also look into relationships between SEC officials and Madoff&#39;s family members, including Madoff&#39;s niece, who married a former SEC lawyer in 2007. On Saturday, UK financial firm <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/">Bramdean Alternatives Limited</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.bramdean.com/news/send_attachment/48">raised concerns</a> [statement, DOC; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/uk-financial-institution-assails-us.php">report</a>] about the US financial regulatory process after its value dropped by more than 35 percent following news of its exposure to the fraud.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A jury at the Manchester Crown Court Thursday convicted a British Muslim suspected of al Qaeda involvement on charges of directing terrorism. Rangzieb Ahmed is the first person in the UK to be convicted of this crime under the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060011_en.pdf">Terrorism Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF]. Ahmed was allegedly a high-level al Qaeda member with ties to some of the organization&#39;s leaders. He is accused of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7789773.stm">setting up a terrorist cell</a> [BBC report] in Manchester, and he allegedly boasted of meeting <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive], the man accused of planning the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Ahmed also had a book with <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3833696/British-al-Qaeda-chief-found-guilty-of-directing-operations.html">contact information for al Qaeda leaders</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] written in invisible ink. Ahmed will be sentenced Friday. A second man, Habib Ahmed, who is not related to Rangzieb Ahmed, was convicted of al Qaeda membership but cleared of other terrorism charges. Habib Ahmed&#39;s wife was also cleared of charges of funding terrorism. <br /><br />Rangzieb Ahmed was originally <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7002132.stm">charged</a> [BBC report] in September 2007. Prosecutors told the court that he was a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7633574.stm">key member of al Qaeda</a> [BBC report], but he denied all charges. Last moth, he told the court that he had <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7711929.stm">lied about being a terrorist in order to make money</a> [BBC report] by selling his story to a newspaper.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] At least 23 employees of the Iraqi <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+interior+ministry">Ministry of the Interior</a> [JURIST news archive] have been arrested this week for alleged attempts to rebuild Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath party</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=baath">news archive</a>], a ministry spokesman confirmed Thursday. Speaking at a press conference, Major-General Abdul Karim Khalaf said that the officials are being questioned for possible connections to the so-called al-Awda (&quot;The Return&quot;) movement, the current incarnation of the defunct Baath party. Khalaf said that the officials are not presently accused of plotting a coup, contrary to an earlier <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/world/middleeast/18iraq.html?_r=1&hp">report</a> [NYT report]. Ministry public relations head Brigadier-General Alaa al-Taei confirmed that no coup plot has been alleged, but said there is evidence that the officials <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/12/2008121814321396286.html">planned to burn down the ministry</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Al Jazeera</span> report].  Unnamed ministry sources also said that the arrested range from low-ranking officers to a traffic police brigadier general, and do not include four generals as initially rumored.  Khalaf said the interrogations are being conducted under the supervision of the Iraqi judiciary. <br /><br />The US-run <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/">Coalition Provisional Authority</a> [official website] prioritized outlawing the Baath Party, and in 2003 Iraq established the <a href="http://www.debaath.com/index2.htm">De-Baathification Commission</a> [official website] aimed at rooting out members of Hussein&#39;s party from positions of power in the Iraqi government. The Commission prompted the <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/iraq-court-bans-100-former-baath.php">forced removal</a> [JURIST report] of approximately 30,000 Baathists from public life. The Bush administration eventually urged the Iraqi government to shift the commission from outright prohibition to &quot;accountability and reconciliation&quot; in the interests of countering the growing insurgency in the country. De-Baathification reform legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/rice-praises-iraq-parliament-passage-of.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Earlier this year, Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-bill-allowing-reinstatement-of-ex.php">adopted the controversial Accountability and Justice Law</a> [JURIST report], which allows most former Baathists to be reinstated to public life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] and political rival <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/government/prime_minister.htm">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/news/dec08/2008171202.htm">announced legislation establishing a commission</a> [press release] tasked with investigating the political and ethnic violence that followed Kenya&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">disputed December 2007 presidential election</a> [JURIST report]. The &quot;Statute for the Special Tribunal&quot; will create a tribunal to hold accountable &quot;persons bearing the greatest responsibility for crimes against humanity&quot; during the election aftermath. The move follows a recommendation from October&#39;s <a href="http://www.communication.go.ke/Documents/CIPEV_FINAL_REPORT.pdf">Waki report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/kenya-election-violence-commission.php">report</a>] published by the <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kenya-president-appoints-commission-to.php">specially-appointed Commission of Inquiry into Post-Election Violence</a> (CIPEV) [JURIST report], which requested that a tribunal be established within the territorial boundaries of Kenya with the mandate to prosecute crimes &#8211; &#8220;particularly crimes against humanity&#8221; &#8211; relating to the 2007 general election.  Wednesday&#39;s announcement narrowly met a CIPEV deadline to initiate such a commission or to forward the sealed list of the alleged perpetrators to the special prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Among the provisions will be a requirement that any public office holder implicated in the prosecution will be suspended from duty until the matter is fully adjudicated. The bill will now be prepared by the Cabinet Committee on the National Accord and considered by the Kenyan <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/">National Assembly</a> [official website], which must begin hearings by March or defer to the ICC.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that more than 1,000 people were killed and 500,000 displaced in weeks of protests and rioting following the contentious election.  In March, the Kenyan parliament approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kenya-opposition-threatens-protests.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] between Kibaki and Odinga in an attempt to end the post-election violence which had sparked simmering ethnic tensions in the country. Though the CIPEV report did not include names of the suspected culprits, CIPEV head Justice Philip Waki said the commission found evidence of involvement by prominent politicians, government officials, and businessmen in Kenya but postponed disclosures to prevent the sabotage and adulteration of evidence. CIPEV reportedly delivered the names in a sealed envelope to <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kofi+annan">news archive</a>], who helped mediate the current power-sharing agreement.

Mark Mukasey, a former federal prosecutor, works as an attorney with the New York law firm of <a href="http://www.bracewellgiuliani.com/">Bracewell &amp; Giuliani</a> [firm website] and is representing Frank DiPascali, the chief financial officer at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071019050645/http://www.madoff.com/">Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC</a> [archived website].  DOJ officials did not say when Mukasey found out about the conflict but did say that he was removing himself entirely from the investigation and would not be making any decisions on the case.    <br /><br />The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">filed charges</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>] last week in New York against Madoff and his firm for an alleged $50 billion fraud scheme. On Tuesday, SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long.  The SEC will also look into relationships between SEC officials and Madoff&#39;s family members, including Madoff&#39;s niece, who married a former SEC lawyer in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ictr">news archive</a>] sentenced a former top official in Rwanda&#39;s Ministry of Defence and two other former Rwanda army officers to life imprisonment Thursday after <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2008/582.html">convicting them of genocide and crimes against humanity</a> [press release] in connection with 1994 mass killings that left over 500,000 people dead in gruesome ethnic violence. <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">Colonel Th&eacute;oneste Bagosora</a> [case materials], Director of Cabinet in the Rwandan Ministry of Defence; Major Aloys Ntabakuze, commander of the Para Commando Battalion; and Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, commander of the Operational Sector of Gisenyi, were found guilty by 3 international judges on a panel of the UN-sponsored tribunal sitting in Arusha, Tanzania. The court found Bagasora responsible for the killing of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, President of the Constitutional Court Joseph Kavaruganda, and opposition party officials and government ministers Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Nzamurambaho, Landoald Ndasingwa and Faustin Rucogoza. He was additionally found guilty in connection with the killing of ten Belgian peacekeepers, and was held responsible for organised killings perpetrated by soldiers and militiamen at various locations in the country in early April 1994. Ntabakuze was found guilty for killings committed by his soldiers, and Nsengiyumva was considered responsible for several massacres and targeted killings of civilians, including Tutsi refugees. A fourth officer, General Gratien Kabiligi, head of the military operations bureau (G-3) of the army general staff, was acquitted of all charges against him and ordered released. The court additonally acquitted all the accused of conspiring to commit genocide.  <br /><br />Delivering a <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Bagosora/Summary/Mil.118.12.08.pdf">summary</a> [text, PDF] of an as-yet-unreleased judgement said to be some 500 pages long, Norwegian judge <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/factsheets/mose.htm">Erik Mose</a> [official profile] said:<BLOCKQUOTE>The judgement in this case, often called the Military I trial, is the result of several years of proceedings. Many of us in the courtroom today have been working with each other for most of its 409 trial days. We have considered the evidence of 242 witnesses from the Prosecution and Defence and poured through the more than 30,000 pages of transcripts, nearly 1,600 exhibits, and approximately 4,500 pages of the parties&#8217; final submissions. The amount of evidence in this case is nearly eight times the size of an average single-accused case heard by the Tribunal. Innumerable pages of pleadings have resulted in about 300 written decisions...<br /><br />The evidence of this trial has reiterated that genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes were perpetrated in Rwanda after 6 April 1994. The human suffering and slaughter were immense. These crimes were directed principally against Tutsi civilians as well as Hutus who were seen as sympathetic to the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) or as opponents of the ruling regime. The perpetrators included soldiers, gendarmes, civilian and party officials, Interahamwe and other militia, as well as ordinary citizens. Nevertheless, as the evidence in this case and the history of the Tribunal show, not every member of these groups committed crimes.<br /><br />Also other persons than Tutsis and moderate Hutus suffered in 1994. The process of a criminal trial cannot depict the entire picture of what happened in Rwanda, even in a case of this magnitude.</BLOCKQUOTE>On the Prosecution&#39;s contentious conspiracy argument, the court said:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Chamber certainly accepts that there are indications which may be construed as evidence of a plan to commit genocide, in particular when viewed in light of the subsequent targeted and speedy killings immediately after the shooting down of the President&#8217;s plane. However, the evidence is also consistent with preparations for a political or military power struggle and measures adopted in the context of an on-going war with the RPF that were used for other purposes from 6 April 1994.<br /><br />Consequently, the Chamber is not satisfied that the Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the four Accused conspired amongst themselves or with others to commit genocide before it unfolded from 7 April 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>The ICTR was established by the UN Security Council in 1994 to try those suspected of having committed genocide during the 1994 Rwandan conflict between Hutus and Tutsis. Under UN <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">Security Council Resolution 1503 (2003)</a> [PDF text], it was supposed to complete all trials by the end of the year, and to complete all of its work, including appellate review, by 2010. In June, however, the ICTR prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-seeks-more.php">asked the Council</a> [JURIST report] to extend the ICTR&#39;s mandate, noting that the recent arrests of several genocide suspects meant that the court would not have time to finish several first-instance cases until 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/SupremeCourt/default.asp">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] Wednesday rejected a bid by Illinois <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/about/bio.html">Attorney General Lisa Madigan</a> [official profile] to have <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-ag-asks-state-supreme-court-to.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01a.pdf">corruption charges</a> [complaint, PDF] laid against him last week in connection with his naming of a replacement to fill President-elect Barack Obama&#39;s now-vacant Senate seat. The <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/files/supremecourtorder1.pdf">order rejecting Madigan&#39;s motion to file a complaint</a> [text, PDF] with the court was made without comment. In a <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/pressroom/2008_12/20081217_rule382.html">statement</a> [text] afterwards, Madigan said:<BLOCKQUOTE>Because of Governor Blagojevich&#8217;s refusal to resign, the State of Illinois is in an unsustainable situation. The serious criminal charges against Governor Blagojevich strike directly at the heart of his decision-making process and seriously impede his ability to legitimately exercise the powers of his office. Thus, while the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office and the impeachment process move forward, the State is left with a Governor who cannot make effective decisions on critical and time-sensitive issues.<br /><br />The Illinois Constitution expressly gives the Supreme Court the authority to determine whether the Governor has the ability to serve. Given this constitutional provision, on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, I sought relief in the Illinois Supreme Court to temporarily remove Governor Blagojevich so that the State could continue to function while the U.S. Attorney and the General Assembly proceed. The Constitution does not require the Illinois Supreme Court to act.<br /><br />I am hopeful that the General Assembly will act with deliberate speed. It is imperative that we begin to restore the People&#8217;s confidence in their government.</BLOCKQUOTE>A committee of the Illinois House of Representatives began its <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-legislature-begins-impeachment.php">impeachment investigation</a> [JURIST report] of Blagojevich Tuesday, gathering evidence and testimony related to the charges. Hearings are expected to continue for several weeks. On Wednesday, lawyers for Blagojevich <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/files/gensonletter.pdf">urged that Madigan be removed</a> [letter, PDF] from her role as Blagojevich&#39;s official counsel in the committee proceeding <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/12/read-the-docume.html">given her high court filing to have him ousted from office</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report]. If the committee recommends that Blagojevich be impeached, the recommendation will go to a vote before the entire House. If the House votes to impeach, the proceedings will go before the Senate, which will act as a jury with the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court presiding. This is Illinois&#39;s first impeachment inquiry involving a governor.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian civil rights activists Wednesday issued a statement warning that a proposed law that would change the definition of treason would <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/news/C309FA6">allow the government to arrest any government critic</a> [statement text, in Russian]. The proposed legislation <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/1010/42/373189.htm">extends the definition of treason</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] to include damage to Russia&#39;s constitutional order, sovereignty, or territorial integrity. Rights activists including <a href="http://www.mhg.ru/">Moscow Helsinki Group</a> [advocacy website, in Russian] leader Lyudmila Alexeyeva and Civic Assistance leader Svetlana Gannushkina, called the move a &quot;terrible blow&quot; and a repetition of the Stalin regime. They called on members of parliament to reject the bill and for <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website] not to sign the bill, should it be passed.<br /><br />There has recently been a trend of increased government power in Russia. Last week, the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-lower-house-approves-bill-to-cut.php">approved a  bill that would end jury trials on charges of terrorism and treason</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2007, then-President Vladimir Putin approved <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">amendments to Russia&#39;s law against extremism</a> [JURIST report]. An international panel of jurists reported earlier that year that expanded Russian anti-terrorism laws were leading to <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/rights-panel-says-russian-anti-terror.php">human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report]. In 2006, Putin signed a <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/putin-signs-russia-anti-terror-bill.php">bill giving Russian police and military broad authority</a> [JURIST report] to tap telephone conversations and control electronic communications in the vicinity of counter-terror operations, shoot down hijacked planes threatening public places or strategic facilities, and deal with the aftermath of terrorist attacks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Two prominent Kosovar Albanians were <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10033">found guilty of contempt</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_haraqija_morina/tjug/en/har_jud081217.pdf">judgment summary</a>, PDF] Wednesday in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. Former Kosovo minister for Culture, Youth and Sport Astrit Haraqija was sentenced to five months in prison, and Bajrush Morina, former political advisor to the Deputy Minister of Culture, Youth and Sport and a part-time journalist was sentenced to three months for interfering with a witness during the trial of former Kosovo Albanian military leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/haradinaj/cis/en/cis_haradinaj_al_en.pdf">Ramush Haradinaj</a> [ICTY materials, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=haradinaj">news archive</a>]. The trial chamber found that Haraqija exercised influence over Morina and that Morina told a witness that other witnesses who had testified against Haradinaj had been killed. The court found:<blockquote>[I]t was clear that Bajrush Morina&#39;s words were intended and could only be understood as a strong and unequivocal call on Witness 2 to refrain from testifying in the Haradinaj et al. case. In the Trial Chamber&#39;s view, such behaviour constituted intimidation.</blockquote>The court also found that Haraqija abused his political position.<br /><br />In July, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icty-convicts-journalist-for-exposing.php">convicted a Kosovar journalist</a> [JURIST report] of exposing the identity of a witness involved with the Haradinaj trial. Haradinaj was a senior commander of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force that opposed <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder]. He was <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/har-ii050224e.htm">indicted</a> [initial indictment text] by ICTY prosecutors in 2005. Haradinaj was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in April, but former Chief Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte&#8217;s claims of witness intimidation have brought the proceedings under scrutiny. Prosecutors are now appealing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four white Zimbabwean farmers were charged Thursday with trespassing on state property for failing to vacate farms that were seized by the government. The charges are in defiance of a November ruling by the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/tribunal/">South African Development Community Tribunal</a> [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">ordered Zimbabwe to halt</a> [JURIST report] its controversial <a href="http://www.lands.gov.zw/landreform/landreform.htm">Land Reform Program</a> [official website]. The tribunal held that the program&#39;s seizure of white-owned farms was racially motivated and therefore contrary to the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC) [official website] <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/african/docs/other/sadc6.doc">treaty</a> [text, DOC], but government officials said that they would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-government-to-ignore-african.php">disregard the ruling</a> [JURIST report], saying the program was justified because it corrected past racial disparities which had favored white farmers. Officials said the government would continue to operate the program and seize any remaining white-owned farms. The farmers could face up to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601116&sid=aJi0MfCzMPyA&refer=africa">two years in jail</a> [Bloomberg report] if convicted. A hearing is set for January 5.<br /><br />Zimbabwean <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3017678.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Robert+Mugabe">news archive</a>] has been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/21/zimbabwe.andrewmeldrum">harshly criticized</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> report] for his farm program, which since 2000 has sought to redistribute white-owned land among the nation&#39;s indigenous farmers. In February 2006, <a href="http://www.lands.gov.zw/profiles/mutasa%27s%20profile.htm">Lands Minister Didymus Mutasa</a> [government profile] said that, following controversial constitutional reforms, there are <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-zimbabwe-minister.php">no longer any white farmers operating legally in Zimbabwe</a> [JURIST report]. Many observers attribute Zimbabwe&#39;s disastrous economic circumstances - including an inflation rate <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/09/zimbabwe">exceeding 231,000,000 percent</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</font> report] - to the policy, under which previously productive farms have become barren under new inexperienced owners.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iraqi court on Sunday began a new trial for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2855349.stm">Ali Hassan al-Majid</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=majid">news archive</a>], better known in the Western media as &quot;Chemical Ali,&quot; and three other Saddam Hussein-era officials accused in a 1998 gas attack that killed 5,000 Kurds. The relatives of the plaintiffs were allegedly gassed to death in the Kurdish village of Halabja. Hundreds of Kurds <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE4BK0YZ20081221">called for the execution</a> [Reuters report] of al-Majid, who has already been sentenced to death twice. Also facing trial are former defense minister Sultan Hashem and two intelligence officers.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ictj.org/static/MENA/Iraq/iraq.statute.engtrans.pdf">Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal</a> [governing statute, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraqi-tribunal-gives-chemical-ali.php">sentenced al-Majid to death</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq during the Saddam regime. Al-Majid has also been sentenced to death for the killing of Kurdish Iraqis using chemical weapons during the 1988 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4877364.stm">Anfal campaign</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anfal">news archive</a>]. His death sentence in the Anfal case was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iraq-tribunal-upholds-death-sentences.php">upheld on appeal</a> in September 2007, but Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council did not <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-approves.php">approve the execution</a> [JURIST reports] until late February. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#39;s government said in early March that al-Majid <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/iraq-pm-says-no-chemical-ali-execution.php">would not be executed</a> [JURIST report] until the Presidency Council approved the death sentences of al-Majid&#39;s two co-defendants in that case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Sudanese man charged with aiding an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/home.html&l=en">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] investigation of a <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive] war crimes suspect appeared in court Monday. Mohamed Alsary Ibrahim is <a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLM432733.html">charged</a> [Reuters report] with working to overthrow the constitutional government, waging war against the state, dealing with an enemy country, spying, and passing on confidential military documents in connection with the ICC&#39;s investigation of Sudan&#39;s state minister for humanitarian affairs <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/icc-prosecutor-asks-judges-to-summon-ex.php">Ahmed Haroun</a> [JURIST report]. Ibrahim is the first person to be charged in Sudan for assisting an ICC investigation and could face a death sentence if convicted.<br /><br />In August, ICC prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/otp/otp_bio.html">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] said <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icc-prosecutor-condemns-sudan-war.php">Sudan is merely going through the motions</a> with its <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/special-darfur-prosecutor-appointed-by.php">planned probe</a> [JURIST reports] into Darfur human rights violations. He said that Sudan does not have the political will to bring human rights offenders to justice, noting that an earlier Sudanese investigation into genocide claims was led by Haroun, who is wanted by the ICC. The ICC issued a warrant for Haroun&#39;s arrest last year, but Sudan has refused to turn him over. In July, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">applied</a> [JURIST report] for an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-Summary-20081704-ENG.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [application, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/press/pressreleases/406.html">press release</a>] for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=omar+al-bashir">news archive</a>] on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes for atrocities committed in the country&#39;s Darfur region. No warrant has been issued, but earlier this month, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/icc-chief-prosecutor-urges-states-to.php">urged states to prepare</a> [JURIST report] for the ICC&#39;s imminent ruling.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of the UK <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/index.htm">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/docs/judgments_guidance/r-al-saadoon-mufdhi-v-ssdefence.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Friday that Iraqis Faisal Attiyah Nassar al-Saadoon and Khalaf Hussain Mufdhi, suspected in the 2003 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5399052.stm">deaths of two British soldiers</a> [BBC report], may be transferred to Iraqi custody to face trial. Lawyers for the men had contested their transfer, arguing that it would violate the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#Convention">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR) and the UK <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1851003">Human Rights Act of 1998</a> [texts], because of alleged bias in Iraqi courts and the possibility that the men may be tortured or executed if they are convicted of the crime. The court found that there was insufficient support for the claims of judicial bias or risk of torture, but found that the men would likely face execution if convicted. It further held that even though the death penalty was against the terms of the ECHR and UK law, broader international law principles obligated the transfer of detainees to Iraqi custody even if they face the penalty, as long as its application is reserved for only the most severe offenses:<blockquote>The charges against the claimants fall within the category of the &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; which would justify, in the terms of [a UN Human Rights Committee] comment, the exceptional measure of the death penalty. It follows that, however repugnant the death penalty may be within our domestic legal system and under the Convention, its imposition would not be contrary to international law.  The risk that the claimants may be subject to the death penalty does not, therefore, operate to relieve the United Kingdom of its obligation to transfer the claimants into the custody of the Iraqi court. </blockquote> The men face war crimes charges before the Iraqi Higher Tribunal, and are currently being held by British forces in Iraq. The UK court gave lawyers for the men until Monday to appeal the decision.<br /><br />The British military has faced criticism for holding the two men without charge after an <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span> <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/army-accused-of-human-rights-abuse-in-case-of-iraqis-held-without-trial-for-five-years-847457.html">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-forces-alleged-to-be-secretly.php">report</a>] made their detention public in June. A lawyer for <a href="http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/index.php">Public Interest Lawyers</a> [firm website], retained by the men&#39;s families to work for their release in the British courts, said that the detentions are groudless.

Al-Nashiri is accused of terrorism, attempted murder, and providing material support to terrorism for his alleged role in planning the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061205055035/http://defenselink.mil/pubs/cole20010109.html">2000 al Qaeda attack</a> [DOD report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=USS+Cole">news archive</a>] on the <a href="http://www.cole.navy.mil/">USS Cole</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German government spokesperson Thomas Steg said Monday that Germany would consider taking in detainees released from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison if US President-elect Barack Obama closed the facility. Steg said that <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3895244,00.html">Germany supports closure of the facility</a> [DW report] and that all European Union (EU) member states should cooperate to formulate a plan for taking in detainees who cannot be returned to their homelands because of risk of torture. Hamburg interior minister Christoph Ahlhaus said Monday that his state might be <a href="http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2008/12/22/995417.html">willing to take in detainees</a> [<em>Hamburger Abendblatt</em> report], but would consider each case on an individual basis.<br /><br />Last week, US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] ordered the Pentagon to draft <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52395">a proposal for shutting down</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">report</a>] the military prison at Guantanamo Bay in preparation for a possible order from Obama. Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/chertoff-bio.html">Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff</a> [official profile] told the BBC that before closing the Guantanamo prison, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7782240.stm">Obama must have a plan for dealing with the detainees</a> [transcript text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/chertoff-insists-obama-must-have-plan.php">report</a>]. Portugal&#39;s foreign minister has said that his country would be <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">willing to take in</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees if Obama closed the facility, and encouraged other EU member states to do the same. Rights groups have urged Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month, the ACLU launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Also in November, HRW called upon Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">denounce Bush administration counterterrorism policies</a> [JURIST report] that they described as &quot;abusive.&quot; Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

The five men, Serdar Tatar, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, and Shain Duka, were acquitted of attempted murder, but were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and weapons offenses. The defense had argued that there was no plot, but the government paid informants to get the accused to discuss one. Prosecutors maintained that although the men had no ties to any terrorist organization, they were inspired by al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and were planning an attack. The men face a sentence of up to life in prison. <br /><br />The five suspects were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/six-arrested-for-plotting-attack-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 for allegedly plotting to sneak onto the New Jersey military base and kill soldiers.

Their <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/trial-begins-for-fort-dix-plot-suspects.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in October.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iraqi national living in Maryland on Sunday <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/December/08-nsd-1141.html">pleaded guilty to charges of spying for the Iraqi government</a> [DOJ press release] under <a href="/currentawareness/saddam.php">Saddam Hussein</a> [JURIST news archive]. Saubhe Jassim Al-Dellemy, a former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=baath">Baath party</a> [JURIST news archive] member, pleaded guilty to &quot;conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government,&quot; and faces up to five years in prison. Al-Dellemy allegedly assisted in the shredding of documents that could have compromised the Hussein regime and made his restaurant available as a meeting place for Iraqi intelligence agents. Sentencing is scheduled for March 5. <br /><br />To date, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) [official website] has charged at least a dozen people with spying for the Iraqi government in the US. In July 2007, an Iraqi-born naturalized US citizen living in Michigan, <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/michigan-man-pleads-guilty-to-spying.php">pleaded guilty to spying for the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report], admitting in Detroit federal court that he provided the Iraqi intelligence agents with information about anti-Hussein organizations and individuals. Under the plea agreement, Al-Awadi, who was 78 years old and in poor health, received a prison sentence of no more than 51 months. Al-Awadi and fellow Iraqi spy Najib Shemani, were exposed following the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, which allowed US authorities access to Iraqi intelligence documents. In 2005, a federal grand jury in Indianapolis <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/us-citizen-indicted-for-attempting-to.php">indicted a naturalized US citizen</a> [JURIST report] on charges of trying to sell the names of US intelligence operatives in Iraq to Hussein&#39;s government.

The Iraqi parliament was reported to have reached a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7794646.stm">compromise</a> [BBC report] Sunday, transforming the failed draft law into a parliamentary resolution that would require the approval of only a simple majority, but the process stalled on Monday due to rising tensions between members of parliament and speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, who suspended the legislative session after a number of deputies called for his resignation. Last week, Al-Mashhadani called some parliamentarians &quot;sons of dogs&quot; during a debate over the fate of Iraqi shoe-throwing journalist <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">Muntazer al-Zaidi</a> [JURIST report]. It is not clear when the parliament will meet again, but failure to approve a troop extension agreement before December 31 would leave the legal status of non-US troops uncertain.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Iraqi presidential council <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] that sets a 2011 deadline for the withdrawal of US troops but also approved an additional law calling for a national referendum on the pact in July 2009. The approval of the council, comprising <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4415531.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile] and two vice presidents, was the final step required before the SOFA can go into effect on January 1, 2009, a day after the current UN Mandate authorizing the US presence in Iraq expires. The SOFA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-cabinet-approves-us-status-of.php">approved by the Iraq cabinet</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-parliament-passes-us-status-of.php">Iraq parliament</a> [JURIST reports] in November. In addition to the official deadlines for troop withdrawal, it gives Iraqi courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">limited jurisdiction</a> over American military personnel and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">eliminates immunity</a> [JURIST reports] for US defense contractors working within Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russia&#39;s <a href="http://council.gov.ru">Federation Council</a> [official website, in Russian], the upper house of parliament, gave final approval Monday to amendments to the <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/ConstMain.shtml">Russian Constitution</a> [materials] that would extend <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm">presidential terms</a> [Article 81(1) text] from four to six years and terms for <a href="http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-06.htm">parliament members</a> [Article 96(1) text] from four to five years. The Council issued a <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081222/119086512.html">unanimous resolution approving the amendments</a> [RIA Novosti report] after it was approved by all 83 regional parliaments. The resolution followed earlier endorsements from the <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-lower-house-approves.php">report</a>], or lower house, as well as <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-upper-house-approves.php">Federation Council</a> [JURIST report]. The term extension amendments, once signed into law by <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Medvedev">news archive</a>], will mark the first changes to the Russian constitution since it replaced its Soviet-era predecessor in 1993.<br /><br />Kremlin officials, including Medvedev, have championed the amendments as a way of ensuring the flexibility and sustainability of Russia&#8217;s political system. Critics fear, that the term extensions are designed to orchestrate a longer third term for former president and current prime minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] should Medvedev step aside. Medvedev proposed the changes in his first <a href="http://kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/11/05/2144_type70029type82917type127286_208836.shtml">state of the nation address</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-president-proposes.php">report</a>] to the Federal Council in November.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australian authorities on Sunday removed the final restrictions against former <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay </a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="/currentawareness/hicks.php">David Hicks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Hicks, who served more than five years in the military prison without a trial before pleading guilty to providing material support to al Qaeda, had been under <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/australia-court-imposes-control-order.php">control order</a> [JURIST report] since his release last year. The Australian government&#39;s surveillance of Hicks included weekly meetings with police, a strict curfew, and restrictions on his ability to travel and communicate. Hicks made a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/australia-police-to-lift-control-order.php">public plea</a> [JURIST report] last month, asking for the restrictions to be lifted so he could move forward with his life. Hicks&#39;s father said that Hicks <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_AUSTRALIA_TERRORISM_SUPPORTER?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">remains committed to his rehabilitation</a> [AP report], and the elimination of the restrictions imposed by the government should help his recovery.<br /><br />Hicks <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/hicks-pleads-guilty-to-supporting.php">pleaded guilty</a> to a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-re-charging-guantanamo-detainees.php">charge of supporting terrorism</a> [JURIST reports] before a US military commission in March 2007 after spending more than five years in US custody following his capture in Afghanistan. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/hicks-transferred-to-australia-to.php">transferred to Australia</a> in May 2007 to serve the remainder of his nine-month prison sentence at a maximum security prison near his hometown of Adelaide, South Australia, and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ex-guantanamo-bay-detainee-hicks.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] last December. The control order was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/australia-court-relaxes-control-order.php">relaxed</a> [JURIST report] in February, permitting Hicks to live anywhere in the country, and requiring him to check in with police only twice a week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian security forces on Sunday raided and closed the offices of a human rights group run by Nobel Peace Prize recipient <a href="http://nobelprize.virtual.museum/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-autobio.html">Shirin Ebadi</a> [Nobel profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shirin+Ebadi">news archive</a>]. The Iranian judiciary declared that the office of Ebadi&#39;s Center for the Defense of Human Rights did not have the proper legal permits. The closure prevented the group from conducting its celebration of the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/2008-international-human-rights-day.php">60th anniversary</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) [text]. Ebadi&#39;s organization had assisted the UN in preparing for its recent celebration of the anniversary, during which concern was expressed over the human rights situation in Iran. The celebration was to include the honoring of Taqi Rahmani, who served 17 years in prison for charges stemming from Iran&#39;s <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761588431/islamic_revolution_of_iran.html">Islamic Revolution in 1979</a> [MSN backgrounder]. Ebadi said Sunday that the efforts by the Iranian government <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_IRAN_HUMAN_RIGHTS?SITE=VTBEN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">will not stop her group</a> [AP report] from continuing to promote human rights activities in Iran.<br /><br />Ebadi has criticized the Iranian government&#39;s human rights record several times in the past. In May, her organization released its annual report in which it <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/iran-human-rights-group-condemns.php">condemned the government</a> [JURIST report] for continued harassment and intimidation of dissidents, students, reporters, labor activists, and other government critics. The report also criticized the government&#39;s increased policing of women&#39;s veils and the harsh punishments meted out to women found to be insufficiently covered, considering the practices to be violations of womens&#39; rights. In 2007, Ebadi urged the UN to investigate allegations that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/ebadi-urges-un-probe-of-iran-womens.php">Iranian government had been detaining women&#39;s rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and charging them with national security offenses.

Abdallahi was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jeNJEI-UOIdUbrsN5x92a1Q3P6uAD9573LG00">picked up by military forces</a> [AP report] early Sunday at his home in Lemden and was taken to the capital Nouakchott where he was released. Abdallahi had been under house arrest since a <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/mauritania-military-stages-coup-and.php">military coup</a> [JURIST report] in August.  The release comes after the African Union, the European Union, and the US <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-12-22-voa3.cfm">exerted pressure</a> [VOA report] on the ruling military junta to restore the deposed president to his former position.  <br /><br />In August, a military group staged a coup in Mauritania, detaining Abdallahi and <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20080506/mauritania-names-new-prime-minister.htm">Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed Waqef</a> [AP report]. The coup&#39;s leader, Gen. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, previously backed a <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/military-junta-overthrows-mauritanian.php">2005 coup</a> [JURIST report] that removed <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/39080.stm">then-President Maaoya Sid&#39;Ahmed Taya</a> [BBC report]. Aziz had previously supported Abdallahi, but the two split after Abdallahi made political concessions to conservative Muslim groups. In September, the Mauritanian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/mauritania-legislators-elected-to-court.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] eight of its members to a High Court set to try Abdallahi on corruption charges. The coup overturned the first democratically elected government in the country in more than 20 years.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Argentine court on Friday suspended its decision to release up to 20 suspects who are accused of committing human rights violations during the country&#39;s military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983, known as the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">&quot;Dirty War&quot;</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dirty+war+argentina">news archive</a>]. The court Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/argentina-court-releases-dirty-war.php">released the men pending bail</a> [JURIST report], saying that the two-year legal deadline for holding them without a conviction had expired, but the prosecutor appealed the decision in the wake of outrage from human rights groups. The case will now go before the Supreme Court, and Human Rights Secretary Eduardo Luis Duhalde said that he will <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/argentina/note.jsp?idContent=558840">seek the impeachment of the judges</a> [<em>Buenos Aires Herald</em> report] who ruled in favor of releasing the suspects. Among those to be released on bail were <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/alfredo_astiz_311.html">Alfredo Astiz</a> [Trial Watch profile] and Jorge Acosta, who worked at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7026833.stm">Naval Mechanics School</a> (ESMA) [BBC backgrounder] where thousands were tortured and killed. <br /><br />It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the Argentine government&#39;s campaign against suspected dissidents during the country&#39;s &quot;Dirty War.&quot; In 2005, Argentina&#39;s Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/international-brief-argentine-high.php">struck down amnesty laws</a> [JURIST report] adopted in the 1980s to protect potential defendants, prompting the government to reopen hundreds of human rights cases. In March, Argentine politician and former police chief Luis Abelardo Patti was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/argentina-police-arrest-former-police.php">arrested</a> for crimes allegedly committed during the period. In May, Juan Evaristo Puthod, a victim of the violent suppression, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/missing-argentina-dirty-war-witness.php">kidnapped but later released</a> [JURIST reports] before testifying in a third case. In July, an Argentine court <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-life.php">sentenced former general Luciano Benjamin Menendez</a> and four others to life in prison for the 1977 kidnapping, torture, and killing of four political dissidents during the &quot;Dirty War,&quot; and in August, a court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/argentina-ex-generals-convicted-of.php">convicted Mendendez and another former general</a> [JURIST reports] and sentenced them to life terms for kidnapping, torturing, and murdering Peronist politician Guillermo Vargas Aignasse in 1976 during the coup.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.iq/english/index.php?newlang=english">Iraqi parliament</a> [official website] Saturday voted down a status of forces draft law  which would have permitted 6,000 troops from the United Kingdom, Australia, Romania, El Salvador, and Estonia to remain in the country after the current <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">UN mandate</a> [UN press release] authorizing the multi-national force in Iraq expires on December 31, 2008. Iraqi members of parliament <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7793457.stm">voted 80 to 68 to defeat the bill</a> [BBC report], which was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-cabinet-approves-legislation-for.php">approved by the cabinet</a> [JURIST report] last week. The bill was sent back to the cabinet for amendment, and a second vote is expected early next week. The <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/home">UK Ministry of Defence</a> [official website], which oversees 4,100 troops in Iraq, said that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/humiliation-iraqi-mps-reject-uk-exit-deal-1206404.ece">it will work with the government of Iraq</a> [The <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent</span> report] to come up with &quot;other options&quot; to ensure the legality of their continued military operations in Iraq. Other options could include bi-lateral agreements between Iraq and coalition countries.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the Iraqi presidential council <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] that sets a 2011 deadline for the withdraw of US troops but also approved an additional law calling for a national referendum on the pact in July 2009. The approval of the council, comprising <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4415531.stm">President Jalal Talabani</a> [BBC profile] and two vice presidents, was the final step required before the SOFA can go into effect on January 1, 2009, a day after the current UN Mandate authorizing the US presence in Iraq expires.  The SOFA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-cabinet-approves-us-status-of.php">approved by the Iraq cabinet</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-parliament-passes-us-status-of.php">Iraq parliament</a> [JURIST reports] in November. In addition to the official deadlines for troop withdraw, it gives Iraqi courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">limited jurisdiction</a> over American military personnel and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">eliminates immunity</a> [JURIST reports] for US defense contractors working within Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi judge Dhia Al Kinani Friday announced an investigation into the alleged beating of Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi.  Al-Zaidi was allegedly beaten after throwing his shoes at US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">President George W. Bush</a> [official website] on December 14 during a joint press conference with Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] where the two leaders discussed the signing of the  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>]. Al-Zaidi is charged with offending the head of a foreign state and could face up to seven years in prison. He appeared before a judge last week behind closed doors, leading some to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/3813113/Fears-for-shoe-throwing-journalist-as-he-fails-to-appear-in-court.html">believe that he was beaten</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] while in custody. Since the incident, al-Zaidi has been wildly popular throughout the Arab world. Despite public pressure to release the journalist, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/time/20081219/wl_time/08599186745800">it is unlikely he will be released without trial</a> [TIME report].<br /><br />Al-Zaidi has allegedly suffered brutality first hand in Iraq having been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/14/AR2008121401170.html?hpid=topnews">kidnapped and released by Shiite militiamen in 2007</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post</span> report]. He threw his shoes just after Bush finished his remarks celebrating the SOFA and expressing solidarity with the Iraqi government. The SOFA sets a 2011 deadline for the withdrawal of US troops. It was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">approved by the Iraqi presidential council</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month and will go into effect on January 1, 2009, a day after the current UN Mandate authorizing the US presence in Iraq expires. In addition to the official deadlines for troop withdrawal, the SOFA gives Iraqi courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">limited jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over American military personnel and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">eliminates immunity</a> [JURIST report] for US defense contractors working within Iraq.<br /><br />~12/22/08 - Al-Zaidi&#39;s trial is set to begin on December 31.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani said Friday that 23 employees of the Iraqi <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+interior+ministry">Ministry of the Interior</a> [JURIST news archive] who were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-interior-ministry-officials.php">arrested this week</a> [JURIST report] for alleged attempts to rebuild Saddam Hussein&#39;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2886733.stm">Baath party</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=baath">news archive</a>] have been released. On Saturday, Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+maliki">news archive</a>] said that the arrested individuals <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCbi6rws8jzloJrlh8E5vCb8K37g">were not planning a coup</a> [AFP report] against the government. Interior Ministry spokesperson Major-General Abdul Karim Khalaf said that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-GCA-iraq/idUSTRE4BH0NC20081220">the men will not face charges</a> [Reuters report] and that they have been returned to their families.<br /><br />The US-run <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/">Coalition Provisional Authority</a> [official website] prioritized outlawing the Baath Party, and in 2003 Iraq established the <a href="http://www.debaath.com/index2.htm">De-Baathification Commission</a> [official website] aimed at rooting out members of Hussein&#39;s party from positions of power in the Iraqi government. The Commission prompted the <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/iraq-court-bans-100-former-baath.php">forced removal</a> [JURIST report] of approximately 30,000 Baathists from public life. The Bush administration eventually urged the Iraqi government to shift the commission from outright prohibition to &quot;accountability and reconciliation&quot; in the interests of countering the growing insurgency in the country. De-Baathification reform legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/rice-praises-iraq-parliament-passage-of.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.  Earlier this year, Iraq <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-bill-allowing-reinstatement-of-ex.php">adopted the controversial Accountability and Justice Law</a> [JURIST report], which allows most former Baathists to be reinstated to public life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  California <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Edmund Brown Jr.</a> [official website] on Friday urged the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] to declare <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a> [text, materials] <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1642">unconstitutional</a> [press release].  In a <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1642_prop_8_brief.pdf">brief </a>[text, PDF] submitted to the court, Brown argued that Proposition 8, the ballot measure that amended the state <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">constitution</a> [text] to ban <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive], should be overturned for violating the article I, section 1 of state constitution. Brown concluded:<blockquote>The use of the initiative power to take away a legal right deemed by this Court to be fundamental and from a group defined by a suspect classification is a matter of grave concern.  Existing precedents of this Court do not support the invalidation of Proposition 8 either as a revision or as a violation of the separation of powers.  However Proposition 8 should be invalidated as violating the inalienable right of liberty found in article I section 1 of our Constitution.</blockquote>Brown also added that even if the court finds Proposition 8 constitutional, &quot;it should be narrowly construed to uphold the marriages that took place prior to the enactment of the initiative&quot; between June 16 and November 4, 2008.<br /><br />Last month, the Supreme Court of California <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/S168047_S168066_S168078-11-19-08_ORDER.pdf">agreed</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-high-court-agrees-to-hear.php">report</a>] to hear challenges to Proposition 8, while refusing a <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/s168047-amendedpetitionforextraordinaryrelief.pdf">petition to stay</a> [text, PDF] its enforcement. The court will begin hearing arguments in March to determine whether Proposition 8 violates the state constitution and, if not, its effect on existing same-sex marriages. Petitioners contend the initiative is a constitutional revision, not an amendment, and requires approval from two-thirds of the <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/">state legislature</a> [official website]. The ruling followed two weeks of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/us/16protest.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=proposition+8&st=nyt">protests</a> [NYT report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/demonstrators-protest-california-same.php">report</a>] and <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm">petitions</a> [materials] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-groups-challenge-california-same.php">challenging</a> the amendment since its <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approval</a> [JURIST reports] by voters last month.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [official website] said Friday it will discontinue its controversial policy of suing suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=file-sharing">file-sharers</a> [JURIST news archive] and will instead seek cooperation with major Internet service providers (ISPs) to cut access to repeat file-sharers of copyrighted songs. The RIAA <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122966038836021137.html">said it has worked out preliminary agreements with ISPs</a> [<em>Wall Street Journal</em> report] where if the RIAA suspects a provider&#39;s customers are engaging in illegal file-sharing, they will notify the provider and after repeated warnings the ISPs will cut Internet service to the customer. The RIAA will reserve the right to sue particularly egregious offenders.<br /><br />Record companies filed more than 26,000 lawsuits between 2003 and 2007 over file-sharing, resulting in small settlements for most cases, including <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/music-industry-sues-8000-worldwide-for.php">8,000 cases filed against 17 defendants</a> [JURIST report] worldwide in October 2006. In September, a judge for the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website] <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/files/thomasruling.pdf">ordered a new trial</a> [decision, PDF] for a woman who had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/recording-labels-win-first-illegal-file.php">ordered to pay</a> [JURIST report] $222,000 to record companies for illegally posting copyrighted music on the file-sharing network <a href="http://www.kazaa.com/">Kazaa</a> [corporate website]. Jammie Thomas had sought the new trial on the grounds that the court erred by <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/files/thomasjuryinstructions.pdf">instructing the jury</a> [instructions, PDF] that making the music available on the network alone was enough to violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/">Copyright Act</a> [text], and that the damages imposed against her were excessive.  In March, another woman being sued by the RIAA <a href="http://www.ilrweb.com/viewILRPDFfull.asp?filename=andersen_atlantic_080314SecondAmendedComplaint">sought class action status</a> [amended complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/riaa-facing-racketeering-fraud-spying.php">report</a>] for a <a href="http://info.riaalawsuits.us/documents.htm#Andersen_v_Atlantic">counterclaim</a> [case materials] against the RIAA, several recording companies, and data investigation company <a href="http://www.mediasentry.com/">MediaSentry</a> [corporate website] for allegedly using unscrupulous tactics as part of an RIAA anti-piracy campaign.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Thursday urged Indian <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/press_releases2008.html">President Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil</a> [official website] to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/india-new-anti-terror-laws-would-violate-international-human-rights-stan">reject</a> [press release] the recently passed <a href="http://164.100.47.4/Bios_Search/Bill_texts_pre.aspx?Bill_ID=3230&House=Lok%20Sabha">Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment of 2008</a> (UAPA) [legislative materials], which would allow the government to hold terrorism suspects for up to 180 days. The bill, which comes in response to the recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder], <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/india-parliament-approves-anti.php">was approved</a> [JURIST report] by the lower house of parliament Wednesday and by the upper house Thursday, and must now be signed by Patil before taking effect. AI Asia Pacific Program Deputy Director Madhu Malhotra said, &quot;While we utterly condemn the attacks and recognise that the Indian authorities have a right and duty to take effective measures to ensure the security of the population, security concerns should never be used to jeopardize people&#39;s human rights.&quot; Proponents of the UAPA have said that there are <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=7ce484f2-a63c-41ce-8556-fd7933089469">safeguards in place</a> [<em>Hindustan Times</em> report] to make sure that the new law is not misused.<br /><br />The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city, including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/index.aspx">Human Rights First</a> [advocacy website] Monday filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> <a href="/pdf/HRFamicusKSM.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2008/alert/375/index.htm">requesting a stay of military commission proceedings</a> [press release] against five <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees, including <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-admits-planning.php">self-proclaimed architect of the 9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST report], until <a href="http://change.gov/">President-elect Barack Obama</a> [transition website] takes office in January. The group filed the brief to stay the proceedings after Mohammed and the other defendants said they wanted to <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-911-conspirators-ask-to-plead.php">withdraw all motions and plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. The suspects <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/alleged-911-conspirators-withdraw.php">postponed their offers to plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges against them after the judge required competency hearings for two of them, but Human Rights First says that prosecutors continue to push the case forward and are likely to seek another hearing before Obama&#39;s inauguration. The brief argues that because Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo military prison and end the military commissions system, &quot;there is no legitimate reason to expend judicial resources prosecuting a capital case under a system that will be obsolete before the matter can be tried.&quot;<br /><br />Last week, US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] ordered the Pentagon to draft <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52395">a proposal for shutting down</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">report</a>] the military prison in preparation for a possible order from Obama. Rights groups have urged Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month, the ACLU launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Also in November, HRW called upon Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-urges-obama-to-denounce.php">denounce Bush administration counterterrorism policies</a> [JURIST report] that they described as &quot;abusive.&quot; Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility and the future of the military commissions system.

The resolution also called for the release of political prisoners, and expressed dissatisfaction with the country&#39;s transition to democracy, which, it alleges, has lacked transparency and fairness. An unnamed Myanmar representative in the chamber agreed that human exploitation was unacceptable, but defended his country&#39;s efforts to democratize and called the resolution &quot;blatant interference&quot; with its political autonomy. The resolution passed <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/resguide/r63.shtml">passed 80-25</a> [resolutions summary] with 45 nations abstaining.<br /><br />Human rights <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-group-says-myanmar-judges-should.php">advocacy groups</a> and UN officials including <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-sg-concerned-at-severe-prison-terms.php">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [JURIST reports] have recently expressed concern over excessively harsh prison terms issued to dissidents by Myanmar judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Leading Zimbabwe human rights activist <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38377691731">Jestina Mukoko</a> [advocacy website] has been <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/world/1350109,w-zimbabwe-activist-prison-mugabe-122608.article">taken to the high-security Chikurubi prison</a> [AP report] outside of Harare in violation of a court order that she be taken to a hospital, according to human rights lawyers Friday.  Mukoko, who is charged with attempting to overthrow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>], went missing for three weeks earlier this month and was <a href="http://www.zimbabwemetro.com/politics/jestina-mukoko-feared-dead/">feared dead</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Zimbabwe Metro</span> report].  She nonetheless <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7798600.stm">appeared in court</a> [BBC News report] on Wednesday to face the charges against her while claiming she had been tortured during her three-week detention.  The judge ruled her detention was illegal and that she be taken to a private hospital and given police protection, but she never appeared at the hospital.  Eight other rights activists whose release had also been ordered were taken to the prison.  They could have faced the death penalty if they had been tried and been found guilty for the crimes alleged.<br /><br />Mukoko, head of the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), has played a key role in monitoring and publicizing the wave of violence that has hit the country before and after <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zimbabwe-election-clouded-by-fraud.php">recent presidential elections</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">run-off elections</a> [JURIST reports] that followed.  Mugabe and opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morgan+Tsvangirai">news archive</a>], presidential candidate of the <a href="http://www.mdczimbabwe.org/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website], have been disputing results of March elections for months.  They signed a <a href="http://www.hararetribune.com/index.php?news=404">power-sharing agreement</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Harare Tribune</span> text] in September, under which Mugabe would remain president, Tsvangirai would become prime minister, and each would have two deputies.  The agreement, however, has been stymied over disagreements regarding division of top Cabinet posts, and violence and allegations of human rights violations continue to mar the election results, with the MDC estimating that nearly 100 of its members have been killed since March, and <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2008/11/08/2003428087">more than 100 imprisoned</a> [AFP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0458p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court ruling that two Kentucky statutes regulating interstate wine sales were unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit agreed that <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/krs/titles.htm">KRS 243.155</a> and <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/krs/titles.htm">KRS 244.165</a> [texts], requiring out-of-state wine to be purchased in-person, were discriminatory and thus violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html">Commerce Clause</a> [Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3; text] of the US Constitution. The court found that the in-person requirement, which would force Kentucky residents to travel as much as 4,800 miles in some circumstances, was financially infeasible. Judge Eric L. Clay, writing for the court on whether plaintiffs had met the burden of demonstrating the laws favored in-state actors and burdened out-of-state actors:<br /><blockquote>Because of the economic and logistical barriers caused by the in-person requirement, small Kentucky wineries benefit from less competition from out-of-state wineries. ... Kentucky&#8217;s wholesalers receive benefits that are even more direct: based upon the evidence presented by Plaintiffs, [they and similar wineries] would bypass Kentucky&#8217;s wholesalers altogether if the in-person purchase requirement were lifted.</blockquote>The Kentucky case arose in the wake of <u>Granholm v. Heald</u>, a 2005 US Supreme Court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/supreme-court-rules-states-cant-block.php">found similar statutes in New York and Michigan unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The issue has been <a href="http://www.wineinstitute.org/initiatives/stateshippinglaws">debated in several states</a> [advocacy website], as vineyards seek to expand their market and out-of-state distributors seek to expand diversify their inventory.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Germany <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/143/14925.pdf?PHPSESSID=419a000f8e769bfe604a9368c1929677">filed a lawsuit</a> [ICJ press release, PDF] against Italy in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] Tuesday in a bid to block new claims for personal damages resulting from Nazi actions in World War II. Germany is arguing that an October <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, =Italian] which ordered Germany to pay 1 million euros (USD $1.3 million) in damages to relatives of civilians killed in the town of Civitella during the war, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3899824,00.html">violated the principle of state immunity</a> [DW report].  In its application to the court, Germany asserted:<blockquote>In recent years, Italian judicial bodies have repeatedly disregarded the jurisdictional immunity of Germany as a sovereign State.  The critical stage of that development was reached by the judgment of the Corte di Cassazione of 11 March 2004 in the <em>Ferrini</em> case, where [that court] declared that Italy held jurisdiction with regard to a claim . . . brought by a person who during World War II had been deported to Germany to perform forced labour in the armaments industry.  After this judgment had been rendered, numerous other proceedings were instituted against Germany before Italian courts by persons who had also suffered injury as a consequence of the armed conflict.</blockquote>The <em>Ferrini</em> judgment was later confirmed by other Italian court rulings, including the October decision. Germany is concerned that additional lawsuits may be brought against it.<br /><br />In October the Court of Cassation <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_ottobre_21/cassazione_stragi_germania_c8b20ca4-9f87-11dd-b0d4-00144f02aabc.shtml">awarded the damages</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian] in a case against Max Josef Milde, a German sergeant present at the Civitella attack, who was sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison. Under Italian law, crime victims may seek civil damages as part of a criminal proceeding. Germany had argued that the 1961 Bonn Treaty, where Germany agreed to pay 40 billion marks to Italy for war crimes committed, closed all further financial compensation claims, but the Italian court held the treaty only applied to treatment of the Jews. International agreements that govern situations in which a nation may claim immunity include the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/074.htm">European Convention on State Immunity</a> [text], ratified by members of the Council of Europe in 1972, and the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/4_1_2004.pdf">UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [text], adopted in 2004.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesman for <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/">Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7043713.stm">profile</a>] said Saturday that Australia would be willing to consider acceptance of <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees on a case-by-case basis, according to a <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24845331-2702,00.html">report</a> in <em>The Australian</em>.  Rudd&#39;s spokesman confirmed that Australia, along with other countries, has been approached by the United States concerning prisoner resettlement possibilities. Australia strongly supported US policy in the &quot;war on terror&quot; under the leadership of former prime minister John Howard and was complicit in the Guantanamo detention of Australian national <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=david+hicks">David Hicks</a> [JURIST news archive], who was finally transferred to Australian custody in 2007. While <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">no final decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the detention camp has been reached, US President-elect <a href="http://www.change.gov">Barack Obama</a> [transition website] remains committed to closing the facility.  <br /><br />The prospect of closing Guantanamo Bay has raised concerns about where to relocate the released prisoners.  US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">ordered the Pentagon</a> [JURIST report] to draft a proposal for closing the facility in anticipation of a possible presidential order.  <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-will-consider-taking-in.php">Germany</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> [JURIST reports] have both stated a willingness to accept Guantanamo detainees in support of the facility&#39;s closure and have urged other countries to do so as well.  The Netherlands, on the other hand, has said it <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081224/pl_afp/usattacksjusticeguantanamoeu">will not accept detainees</a> [AFP report] for resettlement and Spain has expressed strong reservations.  The United Kingdom has said it will consider transfers on a case-by-case basis. French officials Friday <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/france-urges-unified-eu-stance-on.php">suggested a unified European Union stance</a> [JURIST report] on the issue but France has not explicitly expressed a willingness to accept detainees itself. France holds the European Union presidency through December 31.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Azerbaijan&#39;s parliament, the <a href="http://www.meclis.gov.az/">Milli Majlis</a> [official website, in Azerbaijani], on Friday <a href="http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/news/view/607/">voted 100-7 to approve a March 18 referendum</a> [press release, in Azerbaijani] that could amend the nation&#39;s <a href="http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_Constitution/_constitution_e.html">constitution</a> [text] to remove presidential term limits. The present law contains a two-term presidential limit, which would bring the administration of <a href="http://www.president.az/index.php">President Ilham Aliyev</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3194422.stm">profile</a>] to an end in 2013 after the expiration of his second five-year term. On Wednesday, a plenary session of the <a href="http://www.constcourt.gov.az/en/">Azerbaijani Constitutional Court</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="http://www.constcourt.gov.az/en/index.php?view=article&catid=1:news&id=262:constitutional-court-makes-judgment-on-draft-act-of-referendum-on-making-amendments-and-supplements-to-constitution-of-azerbaijan-republic&format=pdf">proposals may be put to a national referendum</a> [press release, PDF]. The ruling Yeni Azerbaijan party, which holds a substantial parliamentary majority, said that the referendum strengthens democratic rights of citizens. Opposition parties including the <a href="http://www.musavat.com/site/">Musavat Party</a> [party website] and the Liberal Party have denounced the move as threatening to create a de facto monarchy.  Among the other proposals to be put to vote are provisions that would postpone national elections during wartime.   <br /><br />Aliyev was elected president of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2003 following the death of his father <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2964779.stm">Heydar Aliyev</a> [BBC profile], a prominent leader in the the oil- and gas-rich former Soviet republic since 1969. In October, Aliyev was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7671090.stm">reelected with nearly 90% of the vote</a> [BBC report], though the election was boycotted by opposition parties and was <a href="http://www.osce.org/odihr/item_1_34400.html">internationally criticized for failing to meet democratic standards</a> [OSCE report; NATO <a href="http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2008/p08-130e.html">statement</a>]. Aliyev has been accused by members of the press of <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/trial-begins-for-azerbaijan-journalists.php">heavy-handed repression of the media</a> [JURIST report]. In June, a Freedom House rights group <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/corruption-threatens-rule-of-law-in.php">report said that corruption and repression are increasingly threatening legal rights</a> [JURIST report] in Azerbaijan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/">French Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] on Friday urged the European Union (EU) to <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3903543,00.html">adopt a unified policy</a> [DW report] on whether to accept detainees released from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison if US President-elect Barack Obama closes the facility. The French government has said it would welcome the prison&#39;s closure, but Foreign Ministry Spokesman Eric Chevallier on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ambafrance-us.org/IMG/html/briefing/2008/us241208.htm">did not indicate whether France itself would accept any detainees</a> [press conference transcript]. Some of the EU&#39;s 27 member states have recently expressed opposing views on the matter. <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-will-consider-taking-in.php">Germany</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> [JURIST reports] have said they would consider taking in released Guantanamo detainees, and have encouraged all EU member states to cooperate in formulating a plan for accepting prisoners who cannot be returned to their homelands because of risk of torture. Britain said Wednesday it will consider accepting detainees on a case-by-case basis. Also Wednesday, however, a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman told AFP that the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081224/pl_afp/usattacksjusticeguantanamoeu">Netherlands would not accept any Guantanamo inmates</a> [AFP report], and Spanish Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero said that although Spain might be amendable to requests to accept detainees, the move would <a href="http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID={720D0CD3-A8D4-4677-932F-6AF35F93A68C})&language=EN">raise &quot;serious legal problems&quot;</a> [PL report]. No EU-wide talks are expected before the Czech Republic assumes the <a href="http://eu2009.cz/en/index.html">EU Presidency</a> [Czech Presidency website] on January 1.<br /><br />On December 18, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ordered the Pentagon to draft a <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52395">proposal for shutting down</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">report</a>] the military prison at Guantanamo Bay in preparation for a possible order from President-elect Obama. On Tuesday, US State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2008/113477.htm">called the European response to the need to relocate detainees &quot;quite encouraging&quot;</a> [press conference transcript]. Rights groups have urged Obama to close the controversial military prison upon inauguration in January. Last month, the ACLU launched an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling on Obama to close Guantanamo Bay and end the use of military commissions on his first day in office. Obama and his advisers <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">have yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Six criminal trials in four separate courts began Friday in China&#39;s Hebei province for six people accused of involvement in the country&#39;s recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+milk">melamine-tainted milk scandal</a>.  The six cattle farmers and milk collectors are <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/26/content_10563494.htm">accused</a> [Xinhua report] of making several hundred tons of melamine-containing protein powder and adding it to raw milk before selling the mixture to Chinese dairies between October 2007 and August 2008.  They are formally charged with committing crimes against public security. According to prosecutors, one farmer sold over 600 tons of protein powder for $1 million.  The main dairy that purchased the additive was government-owned farm Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co., which was forced to <a href="http://en.chinagate.com.cn/features/sanlu/2008-09/13/content_16448766.htm">cease production in September</a> [Xinhua report].  The  milk company <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/12/25/sanlu.bankruptcy/index.html?eref=time_world">filed for bankruptcy</a> this Wednesday, and the petition was <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_asia/~3/ixpJZVAkShU/index.html">accepted by a court Friday</a> [CNN reports].  Former Sanlu general manager and board chairwoman Tian Wenhua is scheduled to face trial next Wednesday. Earlier this month the Hebei Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-court-rejects-tainted-milk-class.php">rejected a class action suit</a> [JURIST report] filed against Sanlu by the families of children who died or were harmed as a result of tainted milk. <br /><br />News of possible milk powder contamination by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders.  To date, the Chinese Health Ministry has attributed the contamination to the deaths of six children, and at least 294,000 other children have been affected.

Medvedev has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">pushed anti-corruption reforms since taking office</a> [JURIST report] in May. The new law <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081225/119175337.html">imposes income reporting requirements on persons holding public office</a> [RIA Novosti report], restricts gifts and makes a variety of amendments to existing anti-corruption legislation. In a late September <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/09/30/1827_type82912type82913_207060.shtml">speech</a> to the first session of the country&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-signs-decree-to.php">new Anti-Corruption Council</a> [JURIST report], Medvedev said:<BLOCKQUOTE>Corruption in our country has taken on not only massive dimensions and occurs on a massive scale, it has also become commonplace and routine &#8211; something that characterizes the lives of our citizens. And as you know, it is not banal bribes &#8211; regardless of their size &#8211; that I am referring to, but rather a serious illness which affects our economy and corrupts all of society. In this regard fundamentally lowering the level of corruption is, of course, a strategic challenge facing our country. The achievement of this goal is directly connected with the protection of property rights in Russia, strengthening the legal and judicial systems, and the expansion of free enterprise</BLOCKQUOTE>Corruption is a long-standing problem in Russia, where in 2006 bribes totaling $240 billion were reportedly accepted by corrupt officials. In June 2008, rights group <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/corruption-threatens-rule-of-law-in.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] finding that corruption and repression are increasingly threatening legal rights in several former Soviet republics like Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, with Russia&#39;s court system in particular showing significant deterioration of the rule of law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US President W. George Bush on Tuesday issued <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/December/08-crm-1148.html">presidential pardons</a> [DOJ materials] to 19 people convicted of crimes that ranged from drug trafficking to forging US Treasury checks. Among those pardoned was Charles Thompson Winters, who was convicted of exporting military aircraft to Israel in 1948 in violation of the <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~1930s2/Time/1939/1939ne.html">Neutrality Act of 1939</a> [text].

Bush also commuted the prison term of an Iowa man sentenced to life in prison for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. <br /><br />Many convicted felons, including several well-known figures, are <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/felons-seeking-pardons-before-bush.php">seeking clemency</a> [JURIST report] from Bush before he leaves office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Iraqi parliament Tuesday approved an agreement that will permit 6,000 troops from the United Kingdom, Australia, Romania, and Estonia to remain in the country for a limited time after the current <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9207.doc.htm">UN mandate</a> [UN press release] authorizing the multi-national force in Iraq expires on December 31, 2008. The vote came after Sunni speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani offered his resignation. The vote was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-parliament-delays-vote-on-troop.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report] Monday due to rising tensions between members of parliament and al-Mashhadani, who last week called some parliamentarians &quot;sons of dogs&quot; during a debate over the fate of Iraqi shoe-throwing journalist <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">Muntazer al-Zaidi</a> [JURIST report]. Under the agreement, foreign troops may remain in Iraq through 2009. El Salvador announced Tuesday that it would withdraw its troops by the end of the month.<br /><br />US troops may remain in Iraq until 2011 under a separate <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-presidential-council-approves-us.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. The SOFA was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-cabinet-approves-us-status-of.php">approved by the Iraq cabinet</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/iraq-parliament-passes-us-status-of.php">Iraq parliament</a> [JURIST reports] in November. In addition to the official deadlines for troop withdrawal, it gives Iraqi courts <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/draft-iraq-status-of-forces-pact.php">limited jurisdiction</a> over American military personnel and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-security-contractors-losing-immunity.php">eliminates immunity</a> [JURIST reports] for US defense contractors working within Iraq.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlament.al/">Albanian Parliament</a> [official website, in Albanian] on Monday adopted a law banning former members and affiliates of the nation&#39;s Communist-era secret police force from holding public office. The so-called lustration law will employ a <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24836718-12335,00.html">5-person commission to screen from political candidacy</a> [Reuters report] all associates of the <a href="http://countrystudies.us/albania/169.htm">Sigurimi</a> [LOC backgrounder] secret service during Albania&#39;s Communist regime from November 1944 to December 1990. The bill passed in a 74-2 vote, with one abstention and 63 members of parliament boycotting the vote. Minority parties including the Socialists expressed fears that the law will be used as a political tool to suppress their faction. Several international parties, including the <a href="http://tirana.usembassy.gov/08pr_1218.html">US Embassy in Tirana</a> [press release], the <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR937(2008)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&Site=DC&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">Council of Europe</a> [press release], and the <a href="http://www.osce.org/item/35778.html">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> [press release], urged Albania to proceed with greater care to ensure that the law meets international standards of constitutional protection. At least two dozen sitting judges and prosecutors face termination without a hearing under the law. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha, a <a href="http://www.keshilliministrave.al/?fq=brenda&m=news&lid=9999&gj=gj2">supporter of the law</a> [press release], <a href="http://www.keshilliministrave.al/?fq=brenda&m=news&lid=9993">defended the text as a &quot;moderated version&quot;</a> [press conference transcript] of the <a href="http://www.ictj.org/en/research/projects/vetting/country-cases/1827.html">Czech lustration law of 1991</a> [ICTJ backgrounder], which has been upheld as legal. <br />  <br />Poland passed its own lustration law in 2006, and though <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/poland-court-rules-controversial.php">portions were found to be unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], provisions remained in force authorizing the disclosure of names of public officials who worked with the secret police. Last year, Poland&#39;s Institute of National Remembrance began officially <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/poland-begins-publishing-communist-era.php">publishing a list of public officials</a> [JURIST report] who worked with or were spied on by the country&#39;s Communist-era secret police.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald Tuesday asked the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/">Illinois House of Representatives</a> [official website] to limit its <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-legislature-begins-impeachment.php">impeachment inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into Illinois <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/GOV/">Governor Rod Blagojevich</a> [official website] and avoid looking into the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01a.pdf">criminal charges</a> [complaint, PDF] against him. Fitzgerald warned that an inquiry into the criminal charges could hamper the investigation. The impeachment committee, which has agreed to follow instructions from federal prosecutors, may still consider the fact that Blagojevich is facing criminal charges and the evidence outlined in the complaint, but it cannot question aides and campaign donors about possible crimes. If the committee recommends impeachment, it will go to a vote before the entire House. If the House votes to impeach, the proceedings will go before the Senate, which will act as a jury with the Chief Justice of the Illinois Supreme Court presiding.<br /><br />Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by federal agents on charges of corruption. Both Blagojevich and Harris have been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the senate seat left vacant by Obama and obtaining illegal campaign contributions. They are also accused of threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Harris <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gQcHXIYZaU58UDPVEzCi2aqMShDQD951BG4G0">resigned</a> [JURIST report] his position after the arrest, while Blagojevich has continued to report to work. Last week, the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/SupremeCourt/default.asp">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-high-court-rejects-ag-bid-to.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bid by Illinois <a href="http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/about/bio.html">Attorney General Lisa Madigan</a> [official profile] to have Blagojevich temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/illinois-ag-asks-state-supreme-court-to.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] One of the West Bank&#39;s largest Israeli settlements is an &quot;unauthorized outpost,&quot; according to a <a href="http://www.btselem.org/Download/200812_Orfa_eng.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Publications/Summaries/200812_Ofra.asp">summary</a>] released Monday by Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/">B&#39;Tselem</a> [advocacy website].  The report examined <a href="http://muni.tik-tak.co.il/web/index.asp?codeclient=1350&codesubweb=0&f=1">Ofra</a> [official website, in Hebrew], a settlement in eastern Jerusalem established in 1975, and drew from a <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/israeli-government-study-says-many.php">2005 Israeli government-commissioned study</a> [JURIST report] of Jewish settlements on the West Bank.  That so-called Sasson report, named for former state prosecutor Talia Sasson, established four criteria required for the settlements to be considered legal under local law: an Israeli government-issued decision to establish the settlement, a defined jurisdictional area, a detailed, approved outline plan, and presence on state land or on land that was purchased by Israelis and registered under their name in the Land Registry. The B&#39;Tselem report showed that Ofra meets only the first condition, as it was declared an official community in 1979. According to B&#39;Tselem, the other conditions were not met because at least 58 percent of Ofra&#39;s land had been registered to Palestinians in the Land Registry, in violation of Israeli government decisions and Israeli High Court rulings stating that Israeli settlements may not be built in the West Bank on such land. The report concludes:<blockquote>The existence of the settlements leads to infringement of a long list of human rights of Palestinians, who live under military rule. Among the rights infringed are the right to equality, the right of property, the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to housing, the right to gain a livelihood, and the right to freedom of movement. Israel must dismantle all the settlements in the West Bank, including those recognized by the government as legal. This obligation derives from the severe and ongoing violation of Palestinians&#8217; human rights and from the prohibition on the establishment of settlements elaborated in international humanitarian law.</blockquote>B&#39;Tselem called for Israel to return to the Palestinian landowners the land that was lawfully theirs and to remunerate them for the use of their land. An <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/22/news/ML-Israel-Settlement.php">Ofra spokesperson defended the land as legally purchased</a> [AP report] but said that such transactions are not made public to protect the identities of Palestinians who engage in the sales.   <br /><br />Israel has been strongly criticized by the international community over its settlement and land appropriation activities, particularly in the West Bank. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-destruction-of-palestine-homes.php">Switzerland condemned Israeli destruction of Palestinian homes</a> [JURIST report] in East Jerusalem as a violation of international humanitarian law. Since 2000, more than 1,600 homes have been demolished in the West Bank, including 600 in East Jerusalem. In September, B&#39;Tselem reported that Israeli security policies have resulted in <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/report-accuses-israel-of-excluding.php">Palestinians being prevented from accessing land</a> [JURIST report] adjacent to settlements in the West Bank. In July, Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en&id=">Yesh Din</a> [advocacy website] highlighted the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/israel-police-unresponsive-to-violence.php">lack of investigations and prosecutions</a> [JURIST report] of Israeli settlers in the Occupied Territories who commit crimes against Palestinians. In June, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] said that Israeli <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">plans to expand settlements</a> [Ha&#39;aretz report] in the West Bank <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">violate international law</a> [JURIST report].

The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7796983.stm">original claim</a> [BBC report] against <a href="http://corporate.alitalia.com/en/group/index.htm">Alitalia</a> [corporate website] was brought by an Austrian family that was unable to make their connecting flight as a result of Alitalia&#8217;s flight cancellation. The court held:<blockquote>Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights ... must be interpreted as meaning that a technical problem in an aircraft which leads to the cancellation of a flight is not covered by the concept of &#8216;extraordinary circumstances&#8217; within the meaning of that provision, unless that problem stems from events which, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual control.</blockquote>Monday&#8217;s ruling clarifies the law and forces the airlines to show that the circumstances for the cancellation were in fact extraordinary.<br /><br />The legislation, which <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/eu-to-enforce-tough-airline-passenger.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in 2005, requires airlines to compensate travelers for cancellations, delays, and denial of seats. It places the burden of proof on airlines if they wish to avoid payment. In 2006, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/eu-high-court-upholds-airline.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the airline passenger regulations in a challenge brought by <a href="http://www.iata.org/index.htm">International Air Transport Association</a> [group website] and the <a href="http://www.elfaa.com/">European Low Fares Airline Association</a> [group website; <a href="http://www.elfaa.com/documents/ELFAA%20release%20decision%20on%20DBC%2010Jan06.pdf">press release</a>, PDF], which argued that the law was too costly to implement and some conditions were outside of the airlines&#39; control.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Australian <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/">Attorney General Robert McClelland</a> [official website] said Tuesday that the <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/www/ministers/RobertMc.nsf/Page/MediaReleases_2008_FourthQuarter_23December2008-ComprehensiveResponseToNationalSecurityLegislationReviews">government will reform anti-terrorism legislation</a> [press release] in accordance with the <a href="http://www.ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Publications_AustralianGovernmentresponsetoClarkeInquiryintotheCaseofDrMohamedHaneef-December2008">recommendations</a> [text] of a <a href="http://www.haneefcaseinquiry.gov.au/www/inquiry/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(3A6790B96C927794AF1031D9395C5C20)~Volume+1+FINAL.pdf/$file/Volume+1+FINAL.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] into the case of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haneef">Dr. Mohammad Haneef</a> [JURIST news archive; <a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24837038-661,00.html">timeline</a>] which concluded that the <a href="http://www.afp.gov.au/home.html">Australian Federal Police</a> (AFP) [official website] had no evidence to detain him. Haneef was arrested in July 2007 and held for 25 days without charges after his cousin allegedly participated in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6257194.stm">Glasgow Scotland airport attack</a> [BBC report]. Haneef was later charged with providing support to a terrorist organization. The charges were eventually dropped, but Haneef&#39;s visa was revoked. The report, authored by retired judge John Clarke, found that Haneef should never have been charged and that there was &quot;no evidence that [Haneef] was associated with or had foreknowledge of the terrorist events or of the possible involvement of his second cousins Dr Sabeel Ahmed and Mr Kafeel Ahmed in terrorist activities.&quot; The report also found that the government of former Prime Minister John Howard had not engaged in any wrongdoing, but that mistakes were made. Haneef has said that he <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/23/2454095.htm">does not plan to return</a> [ABC report] to Australia.<br /><br />Last December, the Australian Federal Court upheld a decision to <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/australia-federal-court-upholds-haneef.php">reinstate Haneef&#39;s work visa</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/australia-police-withdraw-bid-to-extend.php">terrorism charge</a> against him was <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/australia-drops-uk-car-bomb-terror.php">dropped</a> [JURIST reports] after the Australian director of public prosecutions reviewed the case and concluded that there was <a href="http://www.cdpp.gov.au/Media/Releases/20070727-Haneef.aspx">insufficient evidence</a> [press release].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&id=2362">appointed a new judge</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] to fill an eight-month vacancy, bypassing public parliamentary hearings established in 2006 and blaming the move on opposition obstruction. Public hearings for the vacancy now being filled by Justice Thomas Cromwell, previously of the <a href="http://www.courts.ns.ca/appeals/index_ca.htm">Nova Scotia Court of Appeal</a> [official website] , were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jLeU3de1UZ2-oVg_H1BGBe0Pdsyw">delayed</a> [CP report] when creation of the all-party parliamentary committee was stalled by the election campaign and again when Harper <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/canada-governor-general-grants-pm.php">suspended parliament</a> [JURIST report] until the new year to avoid a no-confidence vote. Last month, the first meeting of the Selection Panel considered no substantive business because of Opposition objection to the panel&#8217;s composition. Cromwell will be <a href="http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/news_release/2008/08-12-23/08-12-23.html">sworn in</a> [press release] on January 5.<br /><br />Harper added <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/canada-high-court-nominee-formally.php">parliamentary public hearings</a> [JURIST report] to the high court vetting process in 2006 for his first Supreme Court appointment, that of Manitoba lawyer Marshall Rothstein. Harper officially <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=2265">nominated</a> [press release] Cromwell to his post in September after the deliberations of the panel to vet the candidates were cut short.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/home/index.aspx?id=8596">Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheal Martin</a> [official profile] has said that Ireland <a href="http://www.examiner.ie/story/ireland/idauideycw/rss2/">would likely accept detainees</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Irish Examiner</span> report] released from the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] military prison if US President-elect Barack Obama closed the facility. In an interview with the <em>Irish Examiner</em> published Monday, Martin noted that Ireland supports closure of Guantanamo and said it was a &quot;logical follow-through&quot; for Ireland to accept the detainees in order to assist in the facility&#39;s closure, though he added that no detainees with terrorist ties would be accepted.  He also said that Ireland&#39;s final decision on whether to take in Guantanamo detainees would fall on the Irish cabinet.<br /><br />Obama has long indicated that he would close the military prison at Guantanamo bay if elected, raising concerns about where to relocate the released prisoners.  Rights groups have urged closure of the controversial military prison upon Obama&#39;s inauguration in January, with the ACLU launching an <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/11/09/21/ACLUDAY1.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">ad campaign</a> [image, PDF] calling for Obama to end military commissions on his first day in office.  Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] ordered the Pentagon to draft a <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52395">proposal for shutting down the prison</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">report</a>] in preparation for a possible order from Obama.  <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-will-consider-taking-in.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/france-urges-unified-eu-stance-on.php">France</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> [JURIST reports] have said they would consider taking in released Guantanamo detainees, and have encouraged all EU member states to cooperate in formulating a plan for accepting prisoners who cannot be returned to their homelands because of risk of torture. Britain and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/australia-to-consider-accepting.php">Australia</a> [JURIST report] have said they would consider accepting detainees on a case-by-case basis.  <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/poland-minister-not-eager-to-accept.php">Poland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/france-urges-unified-eu-stance-on.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports] have expressed reservations about accepting Guantanamo detainees, while the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081224/pl_afp/usattacksjusticeguantanamoeu">Netherlands has said it will not accept any</a> [AFP report].  Obama and his advisers have <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/no-final-decision-reached-on-guantanamo.php">yet to reach a firm decision</a> [JURIST report] on the closure of the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Twenty-two Chinese dairy companies are expected to pay a total of $160 million to compensate the families of nearly 300,000 children harmed by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+milk">melamine-contaminated milk</a> [JURIST news archive], according to a Tuesday <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/30/content_7351824.htm">report</a> [text] by <span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span>. Government sources have said that $129 million of the settlement will be made as lump sum payments to families whose children were made ill or killed by the contamination. The families are expected to receive between $290 and $29,000 in compensation, depending on the amount of harm caused. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.circ.gov.cn/portal45/default2727.htm">China Insurance Regulatory Commission</a> [official website] has said that another $31 million will go towards a long-term healthcare fund for the children. Some families have already agreed to accept the settlement amounts, but lawyers for other victims have <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_319567.html">urged their clients to reject them</a> [AP report], saying the payouts are too small.<br /><br />Also Tuesday, the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People&#39;s Court <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/30/content_10580819.htm">began the trial</a> [Xinhua report] of Geng Jinping and Geng Jinzhu, two men suspected of adding the chemical as part of a mixture designed to increase the protein content of the milk. The two men were employees of the government-owned <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/be63a6/shijiazhuang_sanlu">Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.</a> [Research and Markets profile], whose chairwoman is expected to face trial on Wednesday for her involvement in the selling of the contaminated milk.<br /><br />The Chinese <a href="http://www.clii.com.cn/english/Associations/21.htm">Dairy Industry Association</a> [Light Industry backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-diary-producers-to-compensate.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the proposed settlement last week, but had not disclosed its amount. News of melamine-contaminated milk first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report], leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of Chinese dairy products. The contaminated milk has left six dead and 294,000 ill, according to the <a href="http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-10/09/content_75326.htm">Ministry of Health</a> [government website]. Four others suspected of involvement in the contamination <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-trials-begin-for-4-more-accused.php">went on trial</a> Monday, and the trials of&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-trials-begin-for-6-accused-in.php">six others</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] began last week.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four criminal trials began Monday in China&#39;s Hebei province for persons accused of involvement in the country&#39;s recent melamine-tainted milk scandal. The four are generally <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6563849.html">accused</a> [Xinhua report] in connection with the manufacture of two hundred tons of melamine-containing protein powder and adding it to raw milk before selling the mixture to Chinese dairies between November 2007 and August 2008. The formal charges against them have not been specified, however. The main dairy that purchased the additive was government-owned farm Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co., which was forced to <a href="http://en.chinagate.com.cn/features/sanlu/2008-09/13/content_16448766.htm">cease production in September</a> [Xinhua report]. The milk company <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/12/25/sanlu.bankruptcy/index.html?eref=time_world">filed for bankruptcy</a> last Wednesday, and the petition was <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_asia/~3/ixpJZVAkShU/index.html">accepted by a court Friday</a> [CNN reports], the same day that <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-trials-begin-for-6-accused-in.php">separate trials began</a> [JURIST report] for six other producers of similar melamine-containing milk powder.  Former Sanlu general manager and board chairwoman Tian Wenhua is scheduled to face trial on Wednesday. Earlier this month the Hebei Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-court-rejects-tainted-milk-class.php">rejected a class action suit</a> [JURIST report] filed against Sanlu by the families of children who died or were harmed as a result of tainted milk.<br /><br />News of possible <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+milk">milk powder contamination</a> [JURIST news archive] by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders. To date, the Chinese Health Ministry has attributed the contamination to the deaths of six children, and at least 294,000 other children have been affected.  On Saturday, the <a href="http://www.clii.com.cn/english/Associations/21.htm">Chinese Dairy Industry Association</a> [Light Industry backgrounder] announced that 22 companies will provide financial compensation to families whose infants were harmed by the contaminated milk. Families will receive a one-time payment of an unspecified amount, and may recover further for any future related medical expenses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Navi+Pillay">news archive</a>] Sunday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx">condemned</a> [statement text] what she called Israel&#8217;s &#8220;disproportionate use of force&#8221; against Hamas targets in Gaza and urged the Israeli government to &#8220;uphold international humanitarian law principles, especially those relating to proportionality in the use of military force and the prevention of collective punishment and the targeting of civilians.&#8221; Pillay&#39;s call follows two days of Israeli airstrikes that have killed 270 people and wounded more than 600, including many civilians, according to a UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=29427&Cr=Palestin&Cr1=">report</a> [text].   <br /><br />Last week, militants in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDpuQ8fDr7DMqOg80Ux1kGXFl84w">fired more than 80 rockets and mortars into southern Israel</a> [AFP report], hitting private residences, public buildings, offices, and other populated areas.  The Israeli government responded by filing two <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israel+and+the+UN/Issues/Israel_submits_letter_of_complaint_to_the_UN_22-Dec-2008.htm">letters of complaint</a> [text; <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israel+and+the+UN/Issues/Israel_files_second_protest_UN_24-Dec-2008.htm">second letter</a> text] with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and warned militants that they would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD959RDG00">pay a &quot;heavy price&quot;</a> [AP report] if attacks continued.   Both letters of complaint, sent by Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Gabriel Shalev, cited <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/chapter7.shtml">Article 51</a> [text] of the United Nations Charter, which provides that a Member-State may act in self-defense in the face of an armed attack until the UN Security Council has taken the steps necessary to maintain international peace and security.  Member-states invoking Article 51 are nonetheless bound by principles of customary international law, including the principles of necessity and proportionality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/leon-bio.html">Richard Leon</a> [official profile] for the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Tuesday ruled that the US government could continue to hold <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv0429-189">Hisham Sliti</a> and <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv2223-107">Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alwi</a> [decisions, PDF]. Both men had filed <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</span> petitions challenging their detention, but Leon found that the government had met its burden of showing that the men were being lawfully detained under the court&#39;s definition of <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-rules-on-meaning-of-enemy.php">&quot;enemy combatant&quot;</a> [JURIST report].  The judge cited undisclosed, classified evidence against the men in both cases, and in his ruling against al Alwi, wrote that government did not have to show that the men had personally engaged in hostilities towards the US or its allies to he held under the designation:<blockquote>Although there is no evidence of petitioner actually using arms against U.S. or coalition forces, the Government does not need to prove such facts in order for petitioner to be classified as an enemy combatant under the definition adopted by the Court. Petitioner Al Alwi&#39;s close ties to Taliban and al Qaeda forces during the year preceding the initiation of force by the United State in October 2001, combined with the fact that he remained with his Taliban unit after hostilities were initiated by the United States and its allies, is more than enough to meet the definitional requirement.</blockquote>Lawyers for the men have said they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/washington/31gitmo.html?hp">may appeal</a> [NYT report] the decisions, because of Leon&#39;s reliance on classified evidence that was not made available to their clients.<br /><br />In November, Leon&nbsp;<a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2004cv1166-276">ordered the release</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-judge-orders-five-guantanamo.php">report</a>] of five Algerian detainees in the first rulings on <span style="font-style:italic;">habeas</span> petition since the June Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1195.pdf">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] granting them the right to challenge their detention. In that case, he found that the government had not provided enough evidence to show that the men had been engaged in or supported hostilities against the US or its allies, but did find that a sixth man could continue to be lawfully detained. The&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-court-begins-habeas-hearings.php"><span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> hearings</a> [JURIST report] for the six Algerians began earlier that month.&nbsp;

Following accusations of <a href="http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=9332">kidnapping and torture</a>, a High Court judge declared the detention of Mukoko and her codefendants <a href="http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=9180">unlawful</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Zimbabwe Times</span> reports] and ordered that they be taken to a private hospital, but the magistrate held that the state&#39;s appeal of that decision prevented their release.&nbsp;The judge also denied bail to five others who have been <a href="http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=9350">charged with planting bombs</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Zimbabwe Times</span> report] at police stations and on railway tracks. Many of those accused are members of the opposition <a href="http://www.mdczimbabwe.org/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> (MDC) [party website] party, but MDC has denied any involvement in anti-government actions.<br /><br />Mukoko played a key role in monitoring and publicizing the wave of violence that hit the country before and after <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zimbabwe-election-clouded-by-fraud.php">recent presidential elections</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">run-off elections</a> [JURIST reports] that followed.

The agreement, however, has been weakened by ongoing violence and alleged human rights violations, with the MDC estimating that nearly 100 of its members have been killed since March, and <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2008/11/08/2003428087">more than 100 imprisoned</a> [AFP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/kennedy-bio.html">Henry Kennedy</a> [official profile] for the US <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Columbia</a>&nbsp;[official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv0749-14-1">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] in favor of three former US soldiers suing <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=north+korea">North Korea</a> [JURIST news archive] for alleged mistreatment they suffered after the country seized their ship in 1968. According to the ruling, William Massie, Donald McClarren, Dunnie Tuck and other crew members of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usspueblo.org/">USS Pueblo</a> [veteran advocacy website] were captured by North Korean forces while operating in international waters, then held in captivity for eleven months where they were regularly beaten, burned, forced to appear in propaganda photographs and subjected to mock executions. The judge ruled that a 1998 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00001605----000-.html">exception</a> [28 USC &sect; 1605 text] to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a>&nbsp;[text] granted the court jurisdiction over the case because &quot;money damages are [being] sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, [or] hostage taking&quot; and because North Korea has been designated as a &quot;state sponsor of terrorism.&quot; Justifying the&nbsp;damages&nbsp;awarded to the men, Kennedy wrote:<blockquote>The  pain and suffering endured by Massie, Tuck, McClarren, and Cdr. Bucher, over the eleven months of their captivity was extensive and shocking.  While there is no set formula for quantifying the damages for such pain and suffering, in some cases of prolonged and abusive captivity, plaintiffs are awarded approximately $10,000 per day for the pain and suffering they experienced while captive...<br /><br />Massie, Tuck, [and] McClarren, suffered physical and mental harm that has endured for the past 39 years and likely will continue to endure throughout the rest of their lives... each, is entitled to $13,400,000 for their post release and future pain and suffering.</blockquote>Kennedy wrote that North Korea was given proper notice of the lawsuit and a chance to arbitrate the matter, but did not respond. The three men, and the wife and estate of a fourth, were awarded a total of $65 million.<br /><br />In June, US President George W. Bush&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080626-9.html">announced plans</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-to-remove-north-korea-from-terror.php">report</a>] to remove North Korea&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/c14151.htm">State Department list of terror sponsors</a> [text] after the country&#39;s February 2007&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2007/02/north-korea-agrees-to-shut-down-reactor.php">agreement</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] to end its nuclear weapons program. Despite the military concessions, the country still faces <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/north-korea-protests-proposed-un.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] for its human right record.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese diary company chairwoman Tian Wenhua on Wednesday <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/31/content_10584145.htm">pleaded guilty</a> [Xinhua report] to charges that she allowed her company to sell milk contaminated with the industrial chemical <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/melamine.html">melamine</a> [FDA backgrounder] even after she knew of the contamination, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Tian and three other executives of <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/be63a6/shijiazhuang_sanlu">Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group</a> [Research and Markets profile], Wang Yuliang, Hang Zhiqi, and Wu Jusheng, went on trial Wednesday for their roles in the contamination that sickened almost 300,000 children and killed at least six. Prosecutors in the case alleged that Sanlu Group received reports of possible contamination as early as December 2007, and that company executives knew about the contamination by May 2008. They also said that despite this knowledge, the company waited until August 2008 to report the problem to government officials, by which time the melamine content of some products had increased to 100 times the levels originally detected. The chemical was reportedly introduced into the milk products as part of mixture designed to increase their protein content. The date for a verdict on the other three defendants has not been set, and all four could face either <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-12/31/content_7355595.htm">life in prison or the death penalty</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report] if convicted.<br /><br />To date, more than 17 defendants have faced criminal charges in connection with the contamination. The trial of <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-trials-begin-for-4-more-accused.php">four other suspects</a> began on Monday, and the trial of <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-trials-begin-for-6-accused-in.php">another six</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] began last week. On Tuesday, it was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-dairy-companies-to-pay-160.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Sanlu Group and 21 other dairy companies involved in the contamination were expected to pay a total of $160 million for healthcare expenses and compensation to the families of injured children. News of possible <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+milk">milk powder contamination</a> [JURIST news archive] by the chemical melamine first <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/china">broke in September</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], following the death of an infant and reports that at least 50 other infants had fallen ill after consuming baby formula, leading to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7624969.stm">massive recalls</a> [BBC report] of both liquid milk products and milk powders.

The amendments were recently approved by <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-upper-house-gives-final-approval.php">both houses of parliament and all 83 regional parliaments</a> [JURIST report], and will not apply to Medvedev&#39;s current presidential term, which expires in 2012. Medvedev also approved amendments which provide for the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] to require annual reports from government agencies, and to allow the body to question government officials regarding agency performance. The changes are the first to be made to Russia&#39;s post-Soviet constitution since its adoption in 1993.<br /><br />Critics fear the move is designed to afford a longer third for former president and current prime minister <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] should Medvedev step aside. Kremlin officials, however, contend the amendments will strengthen the political system. Despite speculation about Medvedev&#39;s possible ambitions to eclipse Putin, experts note any fissures in their partnership could <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081230/ap_on_re_eu/eu_russia_presidential_term">severally hinder the government</a> [AP report]. Medvedev proposed the changes in his first <a href="http://kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2008/11/05/2144_type70029type82917type127286_208836.shtml">state of the nation</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/russia-president-proposes.php">report</a>] address in November.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ecs.gov.bd/English/">Bangladesh Election Commission</a>&nbsp;(BEC) [official website] on Tuesday released <a href="http://123.49.39.5/result/index.php?lang=en">results</a> [BEC materials] for the country&#39;s Monday elections, in which voters elected <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/30/asia/AS-Bangladesh-Profile-Hasina.php">Sheikh Hasina</a> [AP profile] as prime minister and members of her <a href="http://www.albd.org/autoalbd/index.php">Bangladesh Awami League</a> [party website] party as 228 of the country&#39;s 300 parliamentary representatives. The elections, which end two years of military rule in the country, were said to be generally fair and democratic by both domestic and <a href="http://www.eueombangladesh.org/EN/Press.html">international</a> [EU mission materials] monitoring groups. In a <a href="http://www.iri.org/newsreleases/2008-12-30-Bangladesh.asp">release</a>&nbsp;[text] on their observation of the elections, advocacy group <a href="http://www.iri.org/">International Republican Institute</a> (IRI) [advocacy website] praised the results as &quot;accurately [reflecting] the will of Bangladeshi voters,&quot; despite some irregularities:<blockquote>The delegation was particularly impressed with the dedication of the millions of Bangladeshi voters who stood patiently in line to exercise their civic rights and to participate in the political process. At the polling stations observed by IRI&#8217;s teams, the process appeared organized and calm, and election officials were generally knowledgeable about election law. Though observers noted many procedural irregularities they did not believe them of the scope and severity that would call into question the legitimacy of the process or outcome.</blockquote> The US State Department also <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2008/dec/113513.htm">praised</a> [press release] the elections. Despite urging by monitoring groups, members of the opposition <a href="http://www.bnpbd.com/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> [party website], including former prime minister <a href="http://www.un.int/bangladesh/gen/pm-bio.htm">Khaleda Zia</a> [UN profile],&nbsp;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7805342.stm">have challenged</a> [BBC report] results from 220 polling stations. A spokesperson for the BEC said it will investigate the allegations of forgery, ballot tampering, and other violations of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.ecs.gov.bd/English/MenuTemplate1.php?Parameter_MenuID=12&ByDate=0&Year=">election laws</a> [BEC materials].<br /><br />Earlier this month, interim Bangladeshi president <a href="http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/pprofile.html">Iajuddin Ahmed</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/bangladesh-lifts-two-year-emergency.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Emergency Powers (Repeal) Ordinance of 2008, lifting a two-year state of emergency to allow for political campaigning. The state of emergency, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bangladesh-president-declares-state-of.php">declared in January 2007</a> [JURIST report], had suspended democratic rights throughout the country. The state of emergency had been briefly lifted in November, but was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/bangladesh-bans-demonstrations.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] following violent protests after&nbsp;<a href="http://jamaat-e-islami.org/index.php">Jamaat-e-Islami</a> [party website] party leaders were arrested on corruption charges. In June, Hasina was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/former-bangladesh-pm-indicted-in-second.php">indicted</a> on&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/01/bangladesh-ex-pm-hasina-formally.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] that she received approximately $440,000 in illegal kickbacks on a power-plant deal during her earlier term as prime minister between 1996 and 2001.

Bush</a> [official website]. The trial will resume after the Iraqi High Judicial Council determines whether al-Zaidi should be charged with &quot;assaulting a foreign leader,&quot; a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison, or the lesser crime of &quot;insulting a foreign leader,&quot; punishable by a no more than three years in prison. Lawyers for Al-Zaidi sought to have the crime downgraded, arguing that Bush was not put in real danger by the incident. Zaidi&#39;s family members, Iraqi protesters, and advocacy group <a href="http://www.codepink4peace.org/article.php?id=4565">Codepink</a> [press release] have called for his pardon and release. A date for a ruling on the charges against al-Zaidi has not been set.<br /><br />Those opposed to al-Zaidi&#39;s trial have criticized the CCCI for failing to meet international standards of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/14/quality-justice">fairness and due process</a> [HRW report], and have alleged that <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">al-Zaidi was beaten while in custody</a> [JURIST report]. There have also been allegations that a purported apology letter from al-Zaidi <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/18/world/main4675737.shtml">had been forged</a> [CBS report]. The shoe-throwing incident occurred at a December 14 joint news conference where Bush and Iraqi <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Prime Minister al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] were discussing the signing of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/SE_SOFA.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Zimbabwean court on Monday delayed ruling on whether leading human rights campaigner <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38377691731">Jestina Mukoko</a> [advocacy website] and eight other activists charged with plotting to overthrow the government should be released pending trial.  Mukoko, the head of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, and eight other activists were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-rights-activist-jailed-despite.php">charged last week</a> [JURIST report] with recruiting or attempting to recruit people to undergo military training to overthrow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe&#39;s</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] government.  Following accusations of police torture, a High Court judge declared the detention of Mukoko and her codefendants unlawful and ordered that they be taken to a private hospital and given police protection.  The government immediately appealed the decision and neither Mukoko nor her codefendants have appeared at the hospital.  Several of the accused <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jd_JZmhdw6XWClfpenWt9g-dqNNAD95CI2085">appeared in court with bloodied and swollen faces</a> [AP report].<br /><br />Mukoko played a key role in monitoring and publicizing the wave of violence that hit the country before and after <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zimbabwe-election-clouded-by-fraud.php">recent presidential elections</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/zimbabwe-authorities-condemned.php">run-off elections</a> [JURIST reports] that followed. Mugabe and opposition leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Morgan+Tsvangirai">news archive</a>], presidential candidate of the <a href="http://www.mdczimbabwe.org/">Movement for Democratic Change</a> [party website], have been disputing results of March elections for months. They signed a <a href="http://www.hararetribune.com/index.php?news=404">power-sharing agreement</a> [<em>Harare Tribune</em> text] in September, under which Mugabe would remain president, Tsvangirai would become prime minister, and each would have two deputies. The agreement, however, has been stymied over disagreements regarding division of top Cabinet posts, and violence and allegations of human rights violations continue to mar the election results, with the MDC estimating that nearly 100 of its members have been killed since March, and <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2008/11/08/2003428087">more than 100 imprisoned</a> [AFP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ictj.org/static/MENA/Iraq/iraq.statute.engtrans.pdf">Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal</a> [governing statute, PDF] on Sunday commenced a new trial of two Saddam-era officials, including senior figures of Hussein&#39;s government, for their alleged involvement in the execution of thousands of political opponents during Hussein&#8217;s rule. The defendants include Hussein&#8217;s cousin, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2855349.stm">Ali Hassan al-Majid</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=majid">news archive</a>], better known in the Western media as &#8220;Chemical Ali,&#8221; who has received the death sentence during <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraqi-tribunal-gives-chemical-ali.php">two previous trials</a> [JURIST report] and is currently being tried on <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-court-begins-new-trial-for.php">separate charges</a> [JURIST report] in connection with a 1988 gas attack that killed 5,000 of Iraq&#39;s minority Kurds.  Others on trial include Sabawi and Watban Ibrahim, Hussein&#8217;s half brothers, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2266978.stm">Tariq Aziz</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tariq+aziz">news archive</a>], Hussein&#8217;s deputy prime minister, who face additional charges in other trials being heard by the same court.  Defendants in the immediate case have been charged with &#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221; for their involvement in the arrest of tens of thousands of members of Iraqi political parties, sent to jail and often executed between 1981 and Saddam&#39;s ouster in 2003.  Many of the victims were members of current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#8217;s <a href="http://www.islamicdawaparty.com/">Dawa party</a> [official website], founded in 1957 in a bid to combat secularism and promote the role of Islam in Iraqi politics. <br /><br />The Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal was originally set up under the American-led occupation authority to try members of the Hussein government accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other serious crimes committed between 1968 and 2003. It organized the trial of Saddam Hussein and sentenced Chemical Ali to death once for his involvement in the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq during the Saddam regime and again the killing of Kurdish Iraqis using chemical weapons during the 1988 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4877364.stm">Anfal campaign</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anfal">news archive</a>]. His death sentence in the Anfal case was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iraq-tribunal-upholds-death-sentences.php">upheld on appeal</a> in September 2007, but Iraq&#39;s Presidency Council did not <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/iraq-presidency-council-approves.php">approve the execution</a> [JURIST reports] until late February 2008. That is now on hold pending the completion of other trials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg">Egyptian Deputy Interior Minister Hamid Rashid</a> [ministry website, in Arabic] Sunday announced the suspension and investigation of 280 police officers alleged to have abused their power and committed human rights violations. In a statement before the Egyptian Parliament, Rashid said as many as <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/28/news/ML-Egypt-Police.php">1,164 police officers have already been fired</a> [AP report] for similar reasons.  <br /><br />Egypt has recently come under <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Egypt+Human+Rights">increased scrutiny</a> [JURIST archive] on human rights issues, with the conduct of Egyptian police and security services being especially criticized. In April, an Egyptian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/egypt-appeals-court-overturns-sentence.php">overturned</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/egypt-sentences-reporter-to-jail-for.php">jail sentence</a> [JURIST reports] of an <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera</a> [media website] television reporter convicted for her role in producing a film on police torture. In November 2007 two police officers were <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/egypt-court-sentences-2-police-officers.php">sentenced to three years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for sodomizing and beating detainee Emad el-Kabir while videoing the incident on a cell phone. Egyptian bloggers later posted the video on the Internet. In April 2007, Amnesty International <a href="http://amnesty.org/resources/Egypt/index.html">released a report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/egypt-government-systematically-abusing.php">report</a>] criticizing Egypt for systematic human rights abuses of detainees in its police stations, military camps and centers run by State Security Investigations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://tph.judicial.gov.tw/en/default.htm">Taiwan High Court</a> [official website] on Sunday overruled a district court decision to release former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chen+shui-bian">news archive</a>] pending his trial on corruption charges, citing risks of flight, collusion and interference with other witnesses.  The Taipei district court&#8217;s decision to release Chen was originally overruled on December 17 by the High Court.  Sunday&#8217;s reversal was a response to a second ruling by the district court, on December 25, to release Chen without bail on his own recognizance. The former president was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">indicted by Taiwanese prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month on charges of corruption, including embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering.  His wife, his son and daughter-in-law, three former presidential aides, and eight other associates and family members were also indicted. <br /><br />Chen has been detained since his November <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-arrested-on.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of embezzling money from the state affairs fund. While in prison, Chen later went on a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-on-hunger.php">hunger strike</a> and was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/former-taiwan-president-taken-to.php">hospitalized</a> [JURIST reports]. Chen, the former leader of the now-opposition <a href="http://www.dpp.org.tw/">Democratic Progressive Party</a> (DPP) [party website, in Mandarin] who resigned the presidency in May 2008, has maintained his innocence and has said that the investigation of his conduct is a political attack by members of the ruling <a href="http://www.kmt.org.tw/EN_category/eng_category1.html">Kuomintang Party</a> [party website]. Chen spent eight months in prison twenty-one years ago for defaming Nationalist leaders. In September, he was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/former-taiwan-president-cleared-on.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] on more recent defamation charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.msz.gov.pl/Minister,of,Foreign,Affairs,Radoslaw,Sikorski,13614.htmls">Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski</a> [official profile] expressed reservations Saturday over the prospect of accepting detainees released from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] as part of a US strategy to close the prison. In an <a href="http://www.dziennik.pl/polityka/article288317/Guantanamo_w_Polsce_Nie_pale_sie_do_tego.html">interview</a> [excerpts, in Polish] with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dziennik</span> daily, Sikorski ventured that &quot;the establishment of prisons outside the US legal system was one of the more serious errors of the George W. Bush administration&quot; and said he was &#8220;not eager&#8221; to take in prisoners from Guantanamo, who &#8220;would be quite a challenge&#8221; for the Polish prison system due to language and other difficulties.  The head of Poland&#8217;s Parliamentary Committee for Foreign Affairs, Krzysztof Lisek, expressed similar <a href="http://www.polskieradio.pl/thenews/foreign-affairs/?id=98785">concerns</a> [Polskie Radio report] earlier last week, noting the &#8220;cramped conditions in the jails and a notorious lack of places.&#8221; <br /><br />The prospect of closing Guantanamo Bay has raised questions about where to relocate released prisoners. US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/us-defense-secretary-orders-pentagon.php">ordered the Pentagon</a> [JURIST report] to draft a proposal for closing the facility in anticipation of a possible presidential order. <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-will-consider-taking-in.php">Germany</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> [JURIST reports] have both stated a willingness to accept Guantanamo detainees in support of the facility&#39;s closure and have urged other countries to do so as well. The Netherlands, on the other hand, has said it <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081224/pl_afp/usattacksjusticeguantanamoeu">will not accept detainees</a> [AFP report] for resettlement and Spain has expressed strong reservations. The United Kingdom and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/australia-to-consider-accepting.php">Australia</a> [JURIST report] have said they will consider transfers on a case-by-case basis. French officials Friday <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/france-urges-unified-eu-stance-on.php">suggested a unified European Union stance</a> [JURIST report] on the issue but France has not explicitly expressed a willingness to accept detainees itself. France holds the European Union presidency through December 31.
